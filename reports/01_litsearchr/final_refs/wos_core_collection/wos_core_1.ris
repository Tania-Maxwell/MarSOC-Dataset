AB  - To help mitigate the impacts of climate change, many nature-based solutions are being explored. These solutions involve protection and restoration of ecosystems that serve as efficient carbon sinks, including vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs: tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows) also known as 'Blue Carbon' ecosystems. In fact, many nations are seeking to manage VCEs to help meet their climate change mitigation targets through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). However, incorporation of VCEs into NDCs requires national-scale estimates of contemporary and future blue carbon storage, which has not yet been achieved. Here we address this challenge using machine learning approaches to reliably map (with 62-72% accuracy) soil carbon stocks in VCEs based on geospatial data (topography, geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic impacts), using Australia as a case study. The resulting maps of soil carbon stocks showed that there is a total of 951 Tg (+/- 65 Tg) of carbon stock within Australian VCEs. Strong relationships between soil carbon stocks and climatic conditions (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation) allowed us to project future changes in carbon storage across all RCP scenarios for the years 2050 and 2090 to determine changes in environmental suitability for soil carbon stocks. Results show that soil carbon stocks in mangrove/tidal marsh ecosystems are likely to predominantly experience declines in carbon stocks under predicted climate change scenarios (19% of ecosystems area is predicted to have an increase in soil carbon stocks, while 38% of ecosystems area is predicted to have a decrease in soil carbon stocks), but a majority of seagrass area is likely to have increased soil carbon stocks (56% increase, 7% decrease). This approach is effective for developing robust national blue carbon inventories and revealing the capacity for blue carbon to help meet NDCs. The resulting spatially-explicit maps can also be used to pinpoint areas for successful blue carbon projects both now and in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review We use the 'seascape' concept to explore how interactions between mangrove forests, tidal marshes and seagrass influence the storage of carbon in these ecosystems. Mangrove forests, with the other two 'blue carbon' habitats, are exceptionally powerful carbon sinks. Maintaining and enhancing these sinks is an emerging priority in climate change mitigation. However, managing any one ecosystem on its own risks is ignoring important contextual drivers of carbon storage emerging from its place in the seascape. We consider how interactions between these coastal habitats directly or indirectly affect the amounts of carbon they can store.
   Recent Findings The export of carbon from seagrasses may occur over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, much further than reported for mangroves or tidal marshes. Seagrasses may buffer mangroves from wave impacts, assisting forest regeneration. Trophic cascades supported by contiguous blue carbon habitat may limit excessive herbivory and bioturbation in them but evidence is limited.
   Summary Direct transfers of carbon between blue carbon habitats are common and are likely to enhance total carbon storage, but our understanding of their contribution to carbon stocks at the seascape level is elementary. There is evidence for indirect enhancement of carbon storage at the seascape by close association of habitats, mostly through the creation and maintenance of propitious conditions by one ecosystem for another. Protection from waves of mangroves by seagrass and protection from excess nutrients and sediment of seagrass by mangroves and tidal marsh are key mechanisms. There is little evidence or theory suggesting negative effects on carbon storage of one blue carbon habitat on another.

AB  - The protection of organic carbon stored in forests is considered as an important method for mitigating climate change. Like terrestrial ecosystems, coastal ecosystems store large amounts of carbon, and there are initiatives to protect these 'blue carbon' stores. Organic carbon stocks in tidal salt marshes and mangroves have been estimated, but uncertainties in the stores of seagrass meadows-some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth-hinder the application of marine carbon conservation schemes. Here, we compile published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass biomass and underlying soils in 946 distinct seagrass meadows across the globe. Using only data from sites for which full inventories exist, we estimate that, globally, seagrass ecosystems could store as much as 19.9 Pg organic carbon; according to a more conservative approach, in which we incorporate more data from surface soils and depth-dependent declines in soil carbon stocks, we estimate that the seagrass carbon pool lies between 4.2 and 8.4 Pg carbon. We estimate that present rates of seagrass loss could result in the release of up to 299 Tg carbon per year, assuming that all of the organic carbon in seagrass biomass and the top metre of soils is remineralized.

AB  - Carbon stored in coastal wetland ecosystems is of global relevance to climate regulation. Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44% of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32% of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37% of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44% of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (similar to 4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico blue carbon habitats (mangroves, seagrass, and salt marshes) form an important North American blue carbon hot spot. These habitats cover 2,161,446 ha and grow profusely in estuaries that occupy 38,000 km(2) to store substantial sedimentary organic carbon of 480.48 Tg C. New investigations around GoM for Mexican mangroves, Louisiana salt marshes and seagrasses motivated our integration of buried organic carbon to elucidate a new estimate of GoM blue carbon stocks. Factors creating this include: large GoM watersheds enriching carbon slowly flowing through shallow estuarine habitats with long residence times; fewer SE Mexican hurricanes allowing enhanced carbon storage; mangrove carbon productivity enhanced by warm southern basin winter temperatures; large Preservation reserves amongst high anthropogenic development. The dominant total GoM mangrove blue carbon stock 196.88 Tg from total mangrove extent 650,482 ha is highlighted from new Mexican data. Mexican mangrove organic carbon stock is 112.74 Tg (1st sediment meter) plus USA 84.14 Tg. Mexican mangroves vary greatly in storage, total carbon depositional depths and in sediment age (to 3500 y). We report Mexican mangrove's conservative storage fraction for the normally-compared top meter, whereas the full storage depth estimates ranging above 366.78 Tg (high productivity in very deep sediment along the central Veracruz/Tabasco coast) are not reflected in our reported estimates. Seagrasses stock of 184.1 Tg C organic is derived from 972,327 ha areal extent (in 1st meter). The Louisiana marshes form the heart of GoM salt marsh carbon storage 99.5 Tg (in 1st meter), followed by lesser stocks in Florida, Texas, finally Mexico derived from salt marsh extent totaling 650,482 ha. Constraints on the partial estuarine fluxes given for this new data are discussed as well as widespread anthropogenic destruction of the GoM blue carbon. A new North American comparison of our GoM blue carbon stocks versus Atlantic coastal blue carbon stock estimates is presented. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal wetlands can sequester large amounts of organic carbon (OC), providing an additional motivation for the preservation and restoration of these ecosystems. In Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), created coastal wetlands are initially planted with Spartina spp., but nearly all sites naturally transition into mangrove forests. It was hypothesized that carbon storage in the created wetlands would increase with site age due to the accumulation of soil organic carbon and replacement of salt marsh vegetation with mangrove forests. Mature, mangrove-dominated sites had higher total organic carbon stocks (138.7 +/- 13.8 Mg C ha(-1)) than middle-aged transitional sites (85.6 +/- 25.5 Mg C ha(-1)) or young salt marshes (34.5 +/- 7.7 Mg C ha(-1)). Mature sites consisted of tall trees (> 130 cm tall) and scarce salt marsh vegetation. Transitional sites contained mangrove scrubs (30-130 cm tall) and seedlings (< 30 cm tall) while still supporting salt marsh vegetation; younger sites were dominated by salt marsh vegetation and had no trees. Belowground OC constituted the greatest carbon pool (59.4% of the total OC stock), but belowground OC stocks were not significantly different among the site age classes, suggesting that aboveground OC stocks drove the difference in total OC stocks. The total carbon accumulation rate, including both aboveground and belowground OC, was 4.7 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) across the 26-year chronosequence. This study has demonstrated that carbon storage in created coastal wetlands is correlated to wetland age, indicating that these ecosystems have the potential to become significant sources of OC storage.

AB  - Global warming is anticipated to have a significant impact on high-latitude ecosystems which store large amounts of C in their soils and have a predominance of permafrost. The purpose of this study was to estimate the total C storage of different ecosystems along a north-south transect in Alaska. Soil pedons from three Alaska climate zones were studied. These zones were the arctic slope with continuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly tussock tundra and coastal marsh, Interior Alaska with discontinuous permafrost and vegetation predominantly spruce forest on the upland and tundra or bog in the lowland, and Southern Alaska free of permafrost with the vegetation predominantly mixed hardwood and conifers with moss bogs.
   Soil samples were taken from the representative ecosystems of these zones for carbon storage analysis. In the Arctic and Interior Alaska zones, many soils are cryoturbated and as a result the horizons are warped and often broken. These conditions made it impractical to use the common method for estimating C storage that is used for soils with roughly parallel horizons. For this study the linear proportion of each horizon in the cryoturbated pedon was digitized by using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the irregular horizons were collapsed to form a simulated profile with parallel horizons. The carbon content of each pedon was then calculated based on the linear proportions. These carbon stores based on the whole soil (1 m deep) approach were compared to other available estimates from the literature.
   Calculations for pedons from selected ecosystems in Alaska ranged from 169 MgC/ha to 1292 MgC/ha. The organic carbon storage of the arctic coastal marsh pedon amounted to 692 MgC/ha, and that of the arctic tundra pedon amounted to 314 and 599 MgC/ha. The carbon storage of interior forest pedons was 169 and 787 MgC/ha, and the associated organic soil stored nearly 1300 MgC/ha. The carbon storage in the mixed forest and coastal forest pedons was 240 and 437 MgC/ha, respectively. The bog associated with the mixed and coastal forest stored 1260 MgC/ha. Soils with the thickest organic layers were bogs associated with the tundra and boreal forest. These soils had the largest carbon storage. Carbon stores estimated from the whole pedon approach are 30 to 100% higher than those from the literature from the same zones. These data suggest that the global carbon storage estimates based in part on literature values from the N. latitudes, may be underestimated.

AB  - Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous, nevertheless are commonly described on the basis of vegetation distribution within the intertidal zone. Distribution of mangrove and saltmarsh varies in response to frequency of tidal inundation, resulting in environmental gradients in edaphic factors that influence vegetation structure, and subsequently affect sedimentary carbon additions by vegetation and carbon losses by decomposition. Current sampling approaches and reporting do not adequately account for variability of carbon storage within a wetland, and assessments need to capture spatial variation associated with carbon storage to improve estimates of potential carbon mitigation services by natural ecosystems. This study quantifies the variation in near-surface carbon storage (i.e. upper 30 cm) across an intertidal gradient using a stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure. Vegetation distribution and structure, as well as sedimentary controls on carbon content, explained variation in carbon storage. Saltmarsh near-surface carbon storage varied considerably between structural form. This was less evident for mangrove structural forms (i.e. tall, shrub, dwarf), which may be due to mangrove roots extending to depths beyond 30 cm. Sedimentary characteristics correlated with carbon content, demonstrating considerable influence on near-surface carbon storage within a wetland. The principal finding of this study was that variation within a wetland corresponds to the variation between sites. Stable carbon isotopes offer a means to identify previous vegetation contributions to sediment, associated with an earlier stage of wetland development, likely reflecting previous environmental conditions. A stratified sampling approach that recognises vegetation structure provides the capacity to account for variability of carbon within a wetland that is inadequately described by current sampling protocols.

AB  - Coastal vegetation (seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh) termed "blue carbon'' systems have recently been noted for their potentially large carbon storage capacities. This study quantifies sedimentary blue carbon stocks in an urban estuary containing seagrass (Zostera muelleri), mangrove (Avicennia marina), and saltmarsh (Sporobolus virginicus) habitats in the Coffs Creek Estuary (NSW, Australia). The objective of this study is to investigate the carbon storage dynamics, including the evaluation of potential influences from the plant cover and geomorphology. The sediment carbon stock results presented in this work show that mangroves store more carbon, 1070 +/- 827 compared to 858 +/- 190 and 365 +/- 255 Mg ha(-1) than saltmarsh and seagrass, respectively. These results are of interest because in Coffs Creek alone, mangroves have expanded (in area) by more than 25% from 1986 to 2011. The large sediment carbon stocks found in this urban system emphasize the benefits of restoring and protecting these ecosystems as a way of offsetting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide many critical ecosystem services including carbon storage. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the most important component of carbon stock in coastal salt marshes. However, there are large uncertainties when estimating SOC stock in coastal salt marshes at large spatial scales. So far, information on the spatial heterogeneity of SOC distribution and determinants remains limited. Moreover, the role of complex ecological interactions in shaping SOC distribution is poorly understood. Here, we report detailed field surveys on plant, soil and crab burrowing activities in two inter-tidal salt marsh sites with similar habitat conditions in Eastern China. Our between-site comparison revealed slight differences in SOC storage and a similar vertical SOC distribution pattern across soil depths of 0-60 cm. Between the two study sites, we found substantially different effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC distribution. Complex interactions involving indirect effects between soil, plants and macrobenthos (crabs) may influence SOC distribution at a landscape scale. Marked differences in the SOC determinants between the study sites indicate that the underlying driving mechanisms of SOC distribution are strongly system-specific. Future work taking into account complex interactions and spatial heterogeneity is needed for better estimating of blue carbon stock and dynamics.

AB  - Carbon stored in soil and vegetative biomass in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass flats ("coastal blue carbon") is a significant component of the coastal carbon budget due to the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as plant biomass and peat. Growing interest in the protection of these essential yet vulnerable coastal ecosystems, as well as recognition of their capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, has led to the need for rapid and accurate quantification of location-specific coastal blue carbon stocks. This study provides allometric equations for the calculation of aboveground dry biomass based on plant height for 18 salt marsh species from Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The 18 plant species were also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content to determine the appropriate carbon conversion factor to use for blue carbon calculations. The salt marsh plants had an average of 1.2 +/- 0.4% nitrogen and 41.1 +/- 5.5% carbon. With the exception of Batis maritima, which had a carbon content of only 23.4%, carbon content for all other species ranged from 33.4-47.1%. The four most succulent plant species in this study contained an average of 33.3 +/- 7.0% carbon, while the nine graminoid species contained 44.4 +/- 2.0% carbon. These species-specific equations and carbon data provide non-destructive methods to rapidly quantify vegetative biomass and carbon stocks for monitoring efforts and blue carbon stock assessments.

AB  - Sea level rise alters coastal carbon cycling by driving the rapid migration of coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater systems, and replacement of terrestrial forests with tidal wetlands. Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.

AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems, play an important role in climate change mitigation by an effective CO2 capture from atmosphere and water columns and long-term organic carbon (Corg) storage in sediments. Although seagrass meadows are considered intense carbon sinks, information on regional variability in seagrass blue carbon stock and factors influencing its capacity still remain sparse. In the present study, seagrass blue carbon storage by measuring Corg stocks in sediments and living seagrass biomass, and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in seagrass meadows were estimated along the Korean coast. Factors affecting variability in Corg stocks were also analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) regression and principal component analysis (PCA). Projected Corg stocks in sediment, extrapolated to a depth 1 m, exhibited substantial variability among sites, ranging from 49.91 to 125.71 Mg C ha-1. The majority of Corg (96-99%) was stored in sediments, whereas the contribution of living biomass was minor. PLS regression and PCA indicated that Corg stocks in seagrass meadows are strongly associated with sediment characteristics such as dry bulk density and water and mud content. Among seagrass traits, above- to below-ground biomass ratio was significantly related to the quantity of Corg stocks in seagrass meadows. Because of the high spatial variability in Corg stocks and CARs, local and regional differences in seagrass blue carbon storage should be considered to accurately assess the climate change mitigation potential of seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes respond to sea-level rise through a series of complex and dynamic bio-physical feedbacks. In this study, we found that sea-level rise triggered salt marsh habitat restructuring, with the associated vegetation changes enhancing salt marsh elevation resilience. A continuous record of marsh elevation relative to sea level that includes reconstruction of high-resolution, sub-decadal, marsh elevation over the past century, coupled with a lower-resolution 1500-year record, revealed that relative sea-level rose 1.5 +/- 0.4 m, following local glacial isostatic adjustment (1.2 mm/yr). As sea-level rise has rapidly accelerated, the high marsh zone dropped 11 cm within the tidal frame since 1932, leading to greater inundation and a shift to flood- and salt-tolerant low marsh species. Once the marsh platform fell to the elevation favored by low-marsh Spartina alterniflara, the elevation stabilized relative to sea level. Currently low marsh accretion keeps pace with sea-level rise, while present day high marsh zones that have not transitioned to low marsh have a vertical accretion deficit. Greater biomass productivity, and an expanding subsurface accommodation space favorable for salt marsh organic matter preservation, provide a positive feed-back between sea-level rise and marsh platform elevation. Carbon storage was 46 +/- 28 g C/m(2)/yr from 550 to 1800 CE, increasing to 129 +/- 50 g C/m(2)/yr in the last decade. Enhanced carbon storage is controlled by vertical accretion rates, rather than soil carbon density, and is a direct response to anthropogenic eustatic sea-level rise, ultimately providing a negative feedback on climate warming.

AB  - Carbon mitigation services provided by coastal wetlands are not spatially homogeneous. The scale of assessment at which above-ground biomass is measured will directly influence carbon storage estimates. Greater confidence in estimates is obtained with approaches that describe more variation. There is a need to improve accuracy while optimising assessment effort efficiency. Accurate quantification of carbon storage is dependent upon accurate assessment of biomass, carbon content and the extent of vegetation for which carbon storage is being assessed. This study demonstrates that vegetation structure influences above-ground biomass of mangrove and saltmarsh, resulting in considerable variability in biomass estimates and associated carbon storage of temperate coastal wetlands in southeast Australia. For mangrove, variability in above-ground biomass (Mg ha(-1) SE) was best described by measuring height, stem diameter, crown area and vegetation density, whereby tall mangrove (3-8 m in height; 71.50 +/- 12.53 Mg ha(-1)) had higher biomass than both shrub (1.3-3 m in height; 53.06 +/- 6.94 Mg ha(-1)) and dwarf mangrove (< 1.3 m in height; 10.68 +/- 1.77 Mg ha(-1)). Saltmarsh aboveground biomass was best described by height, species and vegetation density, which demonstrated significant differences between rush saltmarsh (15.97 +/- 2.35 Mg ha(-1)) and herbs, grasses and sedges saltmarsh (7.51 0.91 Mg ha '). The effect of this variation was compounded by carbon content (% C), which varied markedly between vegetation structural form and species (30.9-49.8% C). Maintaining accuracy when assessing carbon storage requires mapping units that correspond to the scale of biomass assessments. Results from this study suggest that recognition of variation in biomass and carbon content of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation structure will enhance the accuracy of estimates of carbon storage, and provide the confidence necessary for carbon storage inventories.

AB  - Transformation of agricultural land to natural terrestrial vegetation has been suggested as a means to increase soil carbon storage. However, the capacity for carbon storage in terrestrial soils is limited as compared to soils of tidal salt marshes, the original vegetation of many coastal agricultural lands. In a number of countries, tidal salt marshes have been "reclaimed," that is drained and diked to prevent tidal flooding and create suitable conditions for dry land agriculture. In this study we examine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon accumulation in tidal salt marshes of the Bay of Fundy and estimate the carbon storage potential of the bay's extensive area of reclaimed marsh. Rates of carbon accumulation vary from the upper to the outer Bay, over which there is a gradient of decreasing tidal range and suspended sediment supply. In the outer bay, high-marsh densities are highest (0.042 +/- 0.009 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years are lowest (76 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). The reverse pattern occurs in the upper bay where carbon densities in the high-marsh environment are lowest (0.036 +/- 0.002 g C cm(-3)), but carbon accumulation rates over the past 30 years may be as high (184 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Compared to other ecosystems, the rates of carbon accumulation presented in this study were similar over timescales of years to centuries. Increases in relative sea level (over time) and suspended sediment supply (across the bay) positively affect the marsh soil accumulation rate and the rate of carbon sequestration. Parameters such as %C are not useful predictors of a marsh's potential for carbon sequestration. Soil carbon densities of functioning marshes and reclaimed marsh soils are similar, but marsh soils have a storage capacity that increases with rising sea level, while agricultural soils, such as those in reclaimed marshes, have a fixed (or possibly decreasing in reclaimed marshes) volume over time.

AB  - Grazers can have a large impact on ecosystem processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process should be taken into account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition.

AB  - Understanding blue carbon storage and accumulation prior to engineering projects is essential for assessing the potential co-benefit of carbon storage for natural climate solutions. This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment. We outline subsequent research needed for salt marshes such as Boundary Bay to be included in voluntary carbon markets in British Columbia.

AB  - Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the ability to sequester and store carbon. Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance's National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this 'blue carbon' storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 +/- 1.19% and 23.12 +/- 6.15% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3) to 0.06 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3) with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 +/- 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of $40,000 +/- $35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.

AB  - 'Blue' carbon ecosystems are important carbon storage providers that are currently not protected by any international mechanism, such as REDD. This study aims to contribute to raising awareness in the political domain about the 'blue' carbon issue. This analysis also provides guidance in terms of how to value stock and flows of ecosystem services adding to the debate begun by the Costanza et al. (1997) paper in Nature. Through scenario analysis we assess how human welfare benefits will be affected by changes in the European coastal blue carbon stock provision. The current extent of European coastal blue carbon has an accounting stock value of about US$180 million. If EU Environmental Protection Directives continue to be implemented and effectively enforced, society will gain an appreciating asset over time. However, a future policy reversal resulting in extensive ecosystem loss could mean economic value losses as high as US$1 billion by 2060. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Wetland soils are globally important carbon stores, and natural wetlands provide a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through ongoing carbon accumulation. Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

AB  - Grassland carbon capturing and storage (CCS) is thought to benefit from regulation of grazing. The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh "blue carbon" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

AB  - Tidal marshes are valuable global carbon sinks, yet large uncertainties in coastal marsh carbon budgets and mediating mechanisms limit our ability to estimate fluxes and predict feedbacks with global change. To improve mechanistic understanding, we assess how net carbon storage is influenced by interactions between crab activity, water movement, and biogeochemistry. We show that crab burrows enhance carbon loss from tidal marsh sediments by physical and chemical feedback processes. Burrows increase near-creek sediment permeability in the summer by an order of magnitude compared to the winter crab dormancy period, promoting carbon-rich fluid exchange between the marsh and creek. Burrows also enhance vertical exchange by increasing the depth of the strongly carbon-oxidizing zone and reducing the capacity for carbon sequestration. Results reveal the mechanism through which crab burrows mediate the movement of carbon through tidal wetlands and highlight the importance of considering burrowing activity when making budget projections across temporal and spatial scales.

AB  - Wetland soils are globally important carbon stores, and natural wetlands provide a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through ongoing carbon accumulation. Recognition of coastal wetlands as a significant contributor to carbon storage (blue carbon) has generated interest into the climate change mitigation benefits of restoring or recreating saltmarsh habitat. However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha(-1) in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha(-1)), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.

AB  - The biomasses, carbon standing stocks, and exportations of three saltmarsh species - Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritima and Zostera noltii - were determined and their isotopic composition analyzed to illustrate their role in carbon storage in a temperate Atlantic estuary (Mondego, Portugal). Biomass values were higher in the warmer seasons than in the cold seasons, with carbon contents following the same trend. Carbon content ranged from 27-39% in S. maritimus and S. maritima to 30-39% for Z. noltii. S. maritimus had the highest carbon production in the aboveground organs and had similar results with S. maritima in the belowground carbon production. These three species together occupied about 50% of the salt marsh area and they stored in 21 months of study 24,000 kg of carbon in their aboveground and belowground organs. Z. noltii presented highest carbon concentration in the sediment and S. maritimus the lowest. Stable carbon isotopic analysis showed that apparently, the sedimentary organic matter is composed by a mix of terrestrial sources, macro and microalgae. Regard the high carbon exportation, S. maritima and 1 noltii are constantly accumulating carbon. The studied species have both a sink and source behaviour simultaneously.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are global hotspots of carbon storage but errors exist with current estimates on their carbon density due to the use of factors estimated from other habitats for converting loss-on-ignition (LOI) to organic carbon (OC); and the omission of certain significant carbon pools. Here we show that the widely used conversion factor (LOI/OC = 1.724) is significantly lower than our measurements for saltmarsh sediments (1.92 +/- 0.01) and oversimplifies the polynomial relationship between sediment OC and LOI for mangrove forests. Global mangrove OC stock in the top-meter sediment reaches 1.93 Pg when corrected for this bias, and is 20% lower than the previous estimates. Ecosystem carbon stock (living and dead biomass, sediment OC and inorganic carbon) is estimated at 3.7-6.2 Pg. Mangrove deforestation leads to carbon emission rates at 23.5-38.7 Tg yr(-1) after 2000. Mangrove sediment OC stock has previously been over-estimated while ecosystem carbon stock underestimated.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are carbon and nutrient sinks that capture large amounts of atmospheric CO2 and runoff of nutrients. 'Blue carbon' refers to carbon stored within resident vegetation (e.g. mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) and soil of coastal wetlands. This study aimed to quantify the impact of vegetation type on soil carbon stocks (organic and inorganic) and nitrogen in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of mangroves and tidal marsh habitats within nine temperate coastal blue carbon wetlands in South Australia. Results showed differences in surface soil organic carbon stocks (18.4 Mg OC ha(-1) for mangroves; 17.6 Mg OC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), inorganic carbon (31.9 Mg IC ha(-1) for mangroves; 35.1 Mg IC ha(-1) for tidal marshes), and total nitrogen (1.8 Mg TN ha(-1) for both) were not consistently driven by vegetation type. However, mangrove soils at two sites (Clinton and Port Augusta) and tidal marsh soils at one site (Torrens Island) had larger soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. These results highlighted site-specific differences in blue carbon stocks between the vegetation types and spatial variability within sites. Further, differences in spatial distribution of SOC within sites corresponded with variations in soil bulk density (BD). Results highlighted a link between SOC and BD in blue carbon soils. Understanding the drivers of carbon and nitrogen storage across different blue carbon environments and capturing its spatial variability will help improve predictions of the contribution these ecosystems to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Estimates of carbon store and carbon accumulation rate in mangrove and saltmarsh are beset by issues of scale and provenance. Estimates at a site do not allow scaling to regional estimates if the drivers of variability are not known. Also, carbon accumulation within soils provides a net offset only if carbon is derived in-situ, or would not otherwise be sequestered. We use a network of observation sites extending across 2000 km of southeastern Australian coastline to determine the influence of geomorphic setting and coastal wetland vegetation type on rates of carbon accumulation, carbon store and probable sources. Carbon accumulation above feldspar marker horizons over a 10-year period was driven primarily by tidal range and position in the tidal frame, and was higher for mangrove and saltmarsh dominated by Juncus kraussii than for other saltmarsh communities. The rate of carbon loss with depth varied between geomorphic settings and was the primary determinant of carbon store. A down-core enrichment in delta C-13 was consistent with an increased relative contribution of mangrove root material to soil carbon, as mangrove roots were found to be consistently enriched compared to leaves. We conclude that while surface carbon accumulation is driven primarily by tidal transport of allocthonous sediment, in-situ carbon sequestration is the dominant source of recalcitrant carbon, and that mangrove and saltmarsh carbon accumulation and store is high in temperate settings, particularly in mesotidal and fluvial geomorphic settings.

AB  - Disturbances that remove primary producers and alter substrate chemistry commonly influence ecosystem carbon dynamics. Because coastal wetlands are especially effective in sequestering carbon, quantifying how disturbances may alter their ability to perform this climate-regulating function is important for assessing their carbon storage potential. Here, we quantified soil respiration, litter decomposition, and soil organic carbon (SOC), as a proxy for carbon storage, in areas disturbed by invasive feral hogs Sus scrofa and in adjacent, undisturbed areas within 3 southeastern US salt marshes. Contrary to our hypothesis that hog overturning of soils would stimulate soil respiration, this metric was lower and both surface and subsurface litter decomposition rates were similar in disturbed relative to undisturbed areas across all sites. SOC was lower in disturbed versus undisturbed areas at 2 sites as hypothesized, but higher at 1 site. Surveys and ana lyses reveal that lower and less variable infauna, plant, and benthic algae densities likely suppressed soil respiration in hog-disturbed versus undisturbed areas, while the offsetting effects of lower invertebrate densities and higher soil temperature likely caused decomposition to be consistent within and outside of disturbed areas. Conversely, between-site variation in disturbance intensity, plant canopy structure, and burrowing crab densities mediated the SOC response. These findings suggest that hog removal of plants and disruption of soils can cause tracts of marsh to transition from carbon sinks to sources where these disturbances are intense enough to prohibit rapid plant recovery and promote the gradual respiration of carbon stocks from denuded soils.

AB  - Tidal marshes rank among the ecosystems with the highest capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (C-org) on earth. To inform conservation of coastal vegetated ecosystems for climate change mitigation, this study investigated the factors driving variability in carbon storage. We estimated soil C(org)stocks in tidal marshes across temperate Western Australia and assessed differences among geomorphic settings (marine and fluvial deltas, and mid-estuary) and vegetation type (Sarcocornia quinquefloraandJuncus kraussii) linked to soil biogeochemistry. Soil C(org)stocks within fluvial and mid-estuary settings were significantly higher (209 +/- 14 and 211 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively; 1-m-thick soils) than in marine counterparts (156 +/- 12 Mg C-org ha(-1)), which can be partially explained by higher preservation of soil C(org)in fluvial and mid-estuary settings rich in fine-grained (< 0.063 mm) sediments (49 +/- 3% and 47 +/- 4%, respectively) compared to marine settings (23 +/- 4%). Soil C(org)stocks were not significantly different betweenS. quinquefloraandJ. kraussiimarshes (185 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 13 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively). The higher contribution of tidal marsh plus supratidal vegetation in fluvial (80%) and intermediate (76%) compared to marine (57%) settings further explains differences in soil C(org)stocks. The estimated soil C(org)stocks in temperate Western Australia's tidal marshes (57 Tg C(org)within similar to 3000 km(2)extent) correspond to about 2% of worldwide tidal marsh soil C(org)stocks. The results obtained identify global drivers of soil C(org)storage in tidal marshes and can be used to target hot spots for climate change mitigation based on tidal marsh conservation.

AB  - Compared to other terrestrial environments, coastal "blue carbon" habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests sequester disproportionately large amounts of carbon as standing plant biomass and peat deposits. This study quantified organic carbon stocks in 16 salt marshes, salt barrens, and mangrove forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. The sites included natural, restored, and created wetlands of varying ages and degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Peat deposits were generally less than 30-cm deep and organic content rapidly decreased with depth in all habitats. The top 15 cm of mangrove soil contained an average of 11.0% organic carbon by weight, salt marshes contained 6.6%, and salt barrens contained 1.0%. Total organic carbon stock in mangroves was 133.6 +/- 12.8 Mg ha(-1), with 69.5% of that carbon stored belowground. Salt marshes contained 66.4 +/- 25.0 Mg ha(-1) (93.5% belowground carbon), and salt barrens contained 26.6 +/- 8.3 Mg ha(-1) (96.1% belowground carbon). These values were much lower than global averages for carbon stocks in mangroves and salt marshes, likely due to Tampa Bay's location near the northern limit of mangrove habitat, sandy soil, young age of the restored wetlands, presence of mosquito ditches, and recent habitat conversion from salt marshes to mangroves. In the late 1800s, Tampa Bay's coastal wetlands were dominated by salt marshes, but today they are dominated by mangroves. Based on the blue carbon values from the natural sites in this study, this habitat switching has led to the additional sequestration of 141,000 Mg of carbon in remaining wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed.

AB  - Studies on carbon stock in salt marsh sediments have increased since the review by Chmura et al. (2003). However, uncertainties exist in estimating global carbon storage in these vulnerable coastal habitats, thus hindering the assessment of their importance. Combining direct data and indirect estimation, this study compiled studies involving 143 sites across the Southern and Northern hemispheres, and provides an updated estimate of the global average carbon accumulation rate (CAR) at 244.7 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in salt marsh sediments. Based on region-specific CAR and estimates of salt marsh area in various geographic regions between 40 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N, total CAR in global salt marsh sediments is estimated at similar to 10.2 Tg C yr(-1). Latitude, tidal range and elevation appear to be important drivers for CAR of salt marsh sediments, with considerable variation among different biogeographic regions. The data indicate that while the capacity for carbon sequestration by salt marsh sediments ranked the first amongst coastal wetland and forested terrestrial ecosystems, their carbon budget was the smallest due to their limited and declining global areal extent. However, some uncertainties remain for our global estimate owing to limited data availability.

AB  - Blue carbon habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, have been recognized as carbon burial hotspots; however, methods on measuring blue carbon stocks have varied and thus leave uncertainty in global blue carbon stock estimates. This study analyzes blue carbon stocks in northern Florida wetlands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Carbon measurements within 1-3m length vibracores yield total core stocks of 9.9-21.5 kgC center dot m(-2) and 7.7-10.9 kgC center dot m(-2) for the Atlantic and Gulf coast cores, respectively. Following recent IPCC guidelines, blue carbon stock estimates in the top meter are 7.0 kgC center dot m(-2)-8.0 kgC center dot m(-2) and 6.1 kgC center dot m(-2)-8.6 kgC center dot m(-2) for the Atlantic and Gulf cores, respectively. Changes in stable isotopic (delta C-13, C/N) and lignin biomarker (C/V) indices suggest both coastlines experienced salt marsh and mangrove transgressions into non-blue carbon habitats during the mid- to late-Holocene following relative sea-level rise. These transgressions impact carbon storage within the cores as the presence of carbon-poor soils, characteristic of non-blue carbon habitats, result in lower 1m carbon stocks in north Florida Gulf wetlands, and a deeper extent of carbon-rich soils, characteristic of blue carbon habitats, drive higher 1m and total carbon stocks in north Florida Atlantic wetlands. Future blue carbon research should assess carbon stocks down to bedrock when possible, as land-cover and/or climate change can impact different depths across localities. Ignoring carbon-rich soil below the top meter of soil may underestimate potential carbon emissions based on these changes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle because they have high ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration capability. Previous research focused on the carbon dynamics of organic-rich ecosystems (e.g., salt marshes, mangroves), while little attention has paid to the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich ecosystems such as chenier plains, sandy or shelly beach ridges that are parts of strand plains. Here we examined the carbon stocks and fluxes of the poorly studied chenier plain in the Yellow River Delta, China. The inorganic and organic carbon pools in the top 1 m sediment were 444 +/- 92 Mg C ha(-1) and 89 +/- 7 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. The average CO2 net sequestration was -177 +/- 51 Mg C ha(-1), indicating that the chenier plain had a net CO2 evasion during the entire soil formation process. With plant growth, however, the chenier plain provided a significant carbon sink (395 g C m(-2) a(-1)) on a per-unit area basis. The annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) were 1067 and 672 g C m(-2) a(-1), respectively. The carbon sink strength of the chenier plain was comparable to that of organic-rich salt marshes on a per-unit area basis. The biomass carbon pool was 5.0 +/- 1.4 Mg C ha(-1) in the chenier plain. Moreover, the sediment inorganic carbon content in mudflats was significantly lower than that of vegetated habitats. Our results showed that plant grown in a chenier plain could significantly enhance carbon sequestration by increasing organic carbon storage. Inorganic carbon storage should be considered in blue carbon inventories because inorganic carbon dominates the carbon pool and is important in the carbon cycling in a chenier plain. Our findings can help us better understand the carbon cycling of carbonate-rich coastal ecosystems and can inform chenier plain conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - Carbon sequestration values of wetlands are greatest in their sediments. Northern hemisphere research dominates the earlier saltmarsh carbon sequestration literature, recently augmented by analyses across mainland Australia where species assemblages, catchment histories and environmental settings differ. No previous assessment has been made for Tasmania. Carbon stores and accumulation rates in saltmarsh sediments of the Rubicon estuary, Tasmania, were investigated. Carbon was determined from sediment cores by Elemental Analyser, combined with analysis of organic content and bulk density. Carbon accumulation was determined using short-term and long-term sediment accretion indicators. Results showed carbon densities to be lower than global averages, with variation found between carbon stores of native and introduced species zones. Cores from introduced Spartina anglica indicated a trend of higher sediment carbon percentages relative to cores from native saltmarsh Juncus kraussii and Sarcocornia quinqueflora, and in finer grain sizes. Sediment carbon stock of 30 cm depths was 49.5 Mg C ha(-1) for native saltmarsh and 55.5 Mg C ha(-1) for Spartina. Carbon percentages were low owing to high catchment inorganic sediment yields, however carbon accumulation rates were similar to global averages, particularly under Spartina. Covering 85% of saltmarsh area in the estuary, Spartina contributes the majority to carbon stores, potentially indicating a previously unrecognized value for this invasive species in Australia.

AB  - Seawater-irrigated halophytes are a non-traditional crop that may serve to offset anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions through long-term carbon storage. To assess the feasibility of storing carbon as cultivated halophyte residues in coastal desert soils, the decay rate, microbial activity and microbial decomposer abundance of postharvest residues were investigated for three potential halophyte crops. Decay rates were determined by measuring weight loss from residues in litterbags in both the field and laboratory. The effect of incorporating residues into the soil was examined by locating litterbags both on and below the soil surface. Microbial decomposition activity was measured as the CO(2) efflux from residue amended soil columns in the greenhouse. The abundance of bacteria, fungi, and nematodes was assessed in decomposing residues using litterbags in the field. The three halophytes decomposed at rates similar to those of conventional, non-saline residues (0.20-0.30% d(-1)) whether placed on the surface or buried at 30 cm. Residue type affected microbial activity in soil columns during the first 21 days, but decomposition was similar for the three halophytes thereafter. Residue type affected the abundance of nematodes, but not of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Because the rate of halophyte residue decay and the number of microbial decomposers associated with the residues are similar to those of fresh water systems, there appears to be no advantage in storing carbon as plant residue in this saline agricultural system.

AB  - Coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass) sustain the highest rates of carbon sequestration per unit area of all natural systems(1,2), primarily because of their comparatively high productivity and preservation of organic carbon within sedimentary substrates(3). Climate change and associated relative sea-level rise (RSLR) have been proposed to increase the rate of organic-carbon burial in coastal wetlands in the first half of the twenty-first century(4), but these carbon-climate feedback effects have been modelled to diminish over time as wetlands are increasingly submerged and carbon stores become compromised by erosion(4,5). Here we show that tidal marshes on coastlines that experienced rapid RSLR over the past few millennia (in the late Holocene, from about 4,200 years ago to the present) have on average 1.7 to 3.7 times higher soil carbon concentrations within 20 centimetres of the surface than those subject to a long period of sea-level stability. This disparity increases with depth, with soil carbon concentrations reduced by a factor of 4.9 to 9.1 at depths of 50 to 100 centimetres. We analyse the response of a wetland exposed to recent rapid RSLR following subsidence associated with pillar collapse in an underlying mine and demonstrate that the gain in carbon accumulation and elevation is proportional to the accommodation space (that is, the space available for mineral and organic material accumulation) created by RSLR. Our results suggest that coastal wetlands characteristic of tectonically stable coastlines have lower carbon storage owing to a lack of accommodation space and that carbon sequestration increases according to the vertical and lateral accommodation space(6) created by RSLR. Such wetlands will provide long-term mitigating feedback effects that are relevant to global climate-carbon modelling.

AB  - Recently, greater interest in the resilience of coastal habitat ecosystem services in the northern Gulf of Mexico has emerged due in part to an expansion of mangroves into areas previously dominated by salt marshes. To operationalize coastal wetland ecosystem services for decision-making, there is a need to clarify how salt marshes and mangroves function in this region. The goal of this research is to operationalize blue carbon (carbon stored in coastal habitats) within the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, TX by documenting what we know about blue carbon within the study area, identifying data gaps and future research needs, and using available knowledge to inform management and decision-making within the Reserve. Our research shows that there is a lack of data within the Reserve on mangrove aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and soil carbon and on salt marsh soil carbon. There is also a dearth of information on wetland carbon sequestration and emission rates within the Reserve, making it challenging to inform management and develop a market for blue carbon.

AB  - Shoreline erosion can transition freshwater coastal wetlands from carbon sinks to carbon sources. No studies have explored the impacts of coastal geomorphic processes on freshwater wetland carbon budgets. To do so, we modified a saltmarsh carbon budget model for application in freshwater coastal wetlands. We validated the model with data from a shoreline wetland in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The model generates the carbon budget by differencing carbon export and carbon storage. The inputs for carbon storage are the carbon inventory and maximum wetland age. Inputs for carbon export include erosion rates and overwash extent. The model demonstrates that the wetland examined in this study transitioned to a source of carbon during periods of erosion. In fact, the net carbon export between 2015 and 2018 was 10% of the wetland's original carbon stock. This study indicates that geomorphic change can dictate whether and how freshwater coastal wetlands serve as sources or sinks for terrestrial carbon, and that carbon stocks can fluctuate on a geologically rapid timescale. We recommend that such geomorphic processes be considered when developing carbon budgets for these marginal environments. Furthermore, the carbon budget model refined in this study can be used to prioritize wetlands in land management and conservation efforts.

AB  - The supply of nitrogen to ecosystems has surpassed the Earth's Planetary Boundary and its input to the marine environment has caused estuarine waters to become eutrophic. Excessive supply of nitrogen to salt marshes has been associated with shifts in species' distribution and production, as well as marsh degradation and loss. Our study of salt marshes in agriculturally intensive watersheds shows that coastal eutrophication can have an additional impact. We measured gas fluxes from marsh soils and verified emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) in nitrogen-loaded marshes while the reference marsh was a sink for this gas. Salt marsh soils are extremely efficient carbon sinks, but emissions of N2O, a greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than CO2, reduces the value of the carbon sink, and in some marshes, may counterbalance any value of stored carbon towards mitigation of climate change. Although more research is merited on the nitrogen transformations and carbon storage in eutrophic marshes, the possibility of significant N2O emissions should be considered when evaluating the market value of carbon in salt marshes subject to high levels of nitrogen loading.

KW  - IMPACTS
AB  - Long-term carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently considered a viable strategy for mitigating rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and associated impacts of global climate change. Until recently, the significant below-ground CCS capacity of coastal vegetation such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves has largely gone unrecognized in models of global carbon transfer. However, this reservoir of natural, free, and sustainable carbon storage potential is increasingly jeopardized by alarming trends in coastal habitat loss, totalling 30-50% of global abundance over the last century alone. Human intervention to restore lost habitats is a potentially powerful solution to improve natural rates of global CCS, but data suggest this approach is unlikely to substantially improve long-term CCS unless current restoration efforts are increased to an industrial scale. Failure to do so raises the question of whether resources currently used for expensive and time-consuming restoration projects would be more wisely invested in arresting further habitat loss and encouraging natural recovery.

AB  - Saltmarshes are carbon storage hotspots and help to offset anthropogenic carbon emissions; however, marshes are threatened by sea-level rise, erosion, and human development. Recent efforts to constrain the saltmarsh carbon cycle have focused on the processes of carbon burial and sequestration with respect to sea-level rise and global warming. Simultaneously, many marshes that fringe the margins of estuaries and barrier islands are eroding, which releases old carbon from the saltmarsh and transports it into the estuary, and that process should be included in marsh carbon budgets. Additionally, if marshes cannot transgress the upland at a rate that balances shoreline retreat, then the marsh will narrow, thus reducing the area available for carbon storage. Here, we present the development of a box model that incorporates both carbon storage and carbon export via shoreline erosion to estimate the annual carbon budget of saltmarsh sediments. We test the model using field data collected at a fringing marsh within the Rachel Carson National Estuarine Research Reserve in North Carolina. The shoreline erosion rates along the fringing marsh are variable and the model output shows that the stretch of marsh that is retreating 0.76 m yr(-1) switched to a carbon source in 1930, while another portion of the marsh that is retreating more slowly (0.65 m yr(-1)) will switch to a source in 2021. The model indicates that the carbon budget of a saltmarsh is highly sensitive to the rate of shoreline retreat and that rapidly-eroding marshes may already be net sources of carbon. These results underscore the importance of conserving existing marshes, mitigating shoreline erosion, and considering shoreline erosion in the design of saltmarsh restoration projects.

AB  - Introduction: Nitrogen enrichment of coastal salt marshes can induce feedbacks that alter ecosystem-level processes including primary production and carbon sequestration. Despite the rising interest in coastal blue carbon, the effects of chronic nutrient enrichment on blue carbon processes have rarely been measured in the context of experimental fertilization. Here, we examined the ecosystem-level effects of nitrate (NO3-) enrichment on the greenhouse gas dynamics of a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. We measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes using static chambers through two growing seasons in a salt marsh that was nitrogen-enriched for 13 years and compared fluxes to those from a reference marsh. Outcomes: We found that nitrogen enrichment increased gross primary productivity (GPP) by 7.7% and increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) by 20.8%. However, nitrogen enrichment had no discernible effect on net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Taken together, these results suggest that nitrogen-induced stimulation of R-eco could transform this salt marsh from a carbon sink into a source of carbon to the atmosphere. Conclusion: Our results complement prior findings of nitrogen enrichment weakening soil structure and organic matter stability in tidal salt marshes, suggesting that increased nutrient inputs have the potential to alter the carbon storage function of these ecosystems through enhanced microbial respiration of previously sequestered carbon.

AB  - In peatlands, bacterial tyrosinases (TYRs) are proposed to act as key regulators of carbon storage by removing phenolic compounds, which inhibit the degradation of organic carbon. Historically, TYR activity has been blocked by anoxia resulting from persistent waterlogging; however, recent events of prolonged summer drought have boosted TYR activity and, consequently, the release of carbon stored in the form of organic compounds from peatlands. Since 30% of the global soil carbon stock is stored in peatlands, a profound understanding of the production and activity of TYRs is essential to assess the impact of carbon dioxide emitted from peatlands on climate change. TYR partial sequences identified by degenerated primers suggest a versatile TYR enzyme community naturally present in peatlands, which is produced by a phylogenetically diverse spectrum of bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. One full-length sequence of an extracellular TYR (SzTYR) identified from a soda-rich inland salt marsh has been heterologously expressed and purified. SzTYR exhibits a molecular mass of 30 891.8 Da and shows a pH optimum of 9.0. Spectroscopic studies and kinetic investigations characterized SzTYR as a tyrosinase and proved its activity toward monophenols (coumaric acid), diphenols (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid), and triphenols (gallic acid) naturally present in peatlands.

AB  - We measured total carbon stocks of three marshes: Two formed in association with a developing spit along the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast of New Brunswick, Canada, and another with a lagoon on the coast of Maine, USA. Overall, 46 cores and 157 depth recordings were collected to determine depth of the marsh deposits. Total marsh soil volume was estimated by interpolation. In all marshes soil depth varied in a predictable pattern based upon marsh developmental history. In spit marshes deposit age and thickness increased towards the oldest portion of the spit. In the lagoonal marsh, soil depth was greatest in the center and dedined towards both the upland and seaward margins. This same pattern held on axes perpendicular to the primary, age axis of the spit marshes. In each marsh C density did not significantly vary with depth so that marsh depth was an acceptable estimator of C stock, and therefore driven by the geomorphic context of the marshes we studied. There were major differences in C stock estimates produced using GIS interpolation, average C contained in all marsh cores, or cores along a single transect. Our study demonstrates that assuming a soil depth of just 0.5 or 1 m can substantially under- or overestimate marsh carbon stocks and the value of that stock on a carbon market.

AB  - Shifts in ecosystem structure have been observed over recent decades as woody plants encroach upon grasslands and wetlands globally. The migration of mangrove forests into salt marsh ecosystems is one such shift which could have important implications for global blue carbon' stocks. To date, attempts to quantify changes in ecosystem function are essentially constrained to climate-mediated pulses (30years or less) of encroachment occurring at the thermal limits of mangroves. In this study, we track the continuous, lateral encroachment of mangroves into two south-eastern Australian salt marshes over a period of 70years and quantify corresponding changes in biomass and belowground C stores. Substantial increases in biomass and belowground C stores have resulted as mangroves replaced salt marsh at both marine and estuarine sites. After 30years, aboveground biomass was significantly higher than salt marsh, with biomass continuing to increase with mangrove age. Biomass increased at the mesohaline river site by 130 +/- 18Mg biomass km(-2)yr(-1) (mean +/- SE), a 2.5 times higher rate than the marine embayment site (52 +/- 10Mg biomass km(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting local constraints on biomass production. At both sites, and across all vegetation categories, belowground C considerably outweighed aboveground biomass stocks, with belowground C stocks increasing at up to 230 +/- 62MgCkm(-2) yr(-1) (+/- SE) as mangrove forests developed. Over the past 70years, we estimate mangrove encroachment may have already enhanced intertidal biomass by up to 283097Mg and belowground C stocks by over 500000Mg in the state of New South Wales alone. Under changing climatic conditions and rising sea levels, global blue carbon storage may be enhanced as mangrove encroachment becomes more widespread, thereby countering global warming.

AB  - The study compares the amounts of carbon fixed via photosynthesis of a restored tidal marsh to the total organic carbon remaining in sediments of a natural tidal marsh and arrives at preliminary baselines for carbon sequestration and storage over time. The Eddy-covariance method (indirect method) was used to estimate marsh canopy net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and measured an annual gross primary production of 979 g C m(-2), while the loss through respiration was 766g Cm-2, resulting in a net uptake of 213 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Time of the day, solar irradiation, air temperature, humidity and wind direction all together explained 66% of the variation in NEE. The high marsh community of Spartina patens showed NEE to be significantly higher than the low marsh community. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over long time scales was estimated by measuring the actual amount of total organic carbon contained in dated sediment cores from a natural marsh (direct method), which resulted in a carbon accumulation rate of 192.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Changes in total organic carbon content over time in the core sample showed that 78% of organic carbon remained stored in the sediments after 130 years and only the most recalcitrant carbon (50%) remained under storage beyond 645 years. Overall the study showed that temperate macrotidal salt marshes are net sinks of carbon with potential for long term carbon storage. The marsh turned into a carbon sink at the beginning of May and switched back to being a source in late November. The average sedimentation rate estimated from the 137 CS dating (1950s to present) was 1.4 mm yr(-1) which is similar to accretion rates of comparable S. patens patches in the east coast. Accretion rates derived from our study are slightly lower than the 60+ year rate of sea level rise (2.6 mm yr(-1)) recorded by tide gauge measurements in the Northeast. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Salt marshes are intertidal halophytic vegetations, distributed in mid to lower latitudes. They provide important ecosystem services, including transportation and remineralization of nutrients, habitat for coastal biota, coastal bioshield, biofilters and recreation and cultural benefits. In India, 15 salt marsh species so far have been reported, spread over 1600 km(2). Salt marshes are known to adapt themselves to the changing environmental conditions fairly quickly by maintaining a balance between the existing pressures and the prevailing state. Thus, they tend to retain a long-term ecosystem sustainability under changing environmental conditions. Recent studies have recognized them for their extraordinary capacity of carbon sequestration, which gives them edge amongst the coastal ecosystems, but the carbon stock is comparatively low due to their alarming decline in global areal extent.
   In the Indian context, salt marshes occupy a significant share of the coastline along with the other blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses. This provides India with a very promising alternative for achieving its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution towards climate change mitigation through enhancing additional carbon sinks (INDC goal # 5). But, despite its rich salt marsh diversity and distribution along the entire coastline, Indian salt marshes are one of the most overlooked coastal ecosystems. The documented studies on the Indian marshes are relatively scarce and studies addressing their carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential are totally non-existent. There is an urgent need for targeted scientific studies to be taken up on the Indian salt marsh ecosystems to develop a holistic and updated database, which can support resource management, decisionmaking and facilitate to estimate Blue carbon economy of India.

AB  - In addition to the largest existing expanse of tropical forests, the Brazilian Amazon has among the largest area of mangroves in the world. While recognized as important global carbon sinks that, when disturbed, are significant sources of greenhouse gases, no studies have quantified the carbon stocks of these vast mangrove forests. In this paper, we quantified total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves and salt marshes east of the mouth of the Amazon River, Brazil. Mean ecosystem carbon stocks of the salt marshes were 257 Mg C ha(-1) while those of mangroves ranged from 361 to 746 Mg C ha(-1). Although aboveground mass was high relative to many other mangrove forests (145 Mg C ha(-1)), soil carbon stocks were relatively low (340 Mg C ha(-1)). Low soil carbon stocks may be related to coarse textured soils coupled with a high tidal range. Nevertheless, the carbon stocks of the Amazon mangroves were over twice those of upland evergreen forests and almost 10-fold those of tropical dry forests.

AB  - Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant-soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development.Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant-soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant-soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.

AB  - Salt marshes sequester carbon at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than their terrestrial counterparts, helping to mitigate climate change. As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

AB  - Blue Carbon is a term coined in 2009 to draw attention to the degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems and the need to conserve and restore them to mitigate climate change and for the other ecosystem services they provide. Blue Carbon has multiple meanings, which we aim to clarify here, which reflect the original descriptions of the concept including (1) all organic matter captured by marine organisms, and (2) how marine ecosystems could be managed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation and conservation. The multifaceted nature of the Blue Carbon concept has led to unprecedented collaboration across disciplines, where scientists, conservationists and policy makers have interacted intensely to advance shared goals. Some coastal ecosystems (mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass) are established Blue Carbon ecosystems as they often have high carbon stocks, support long-term carbon storage, offer the potential to manage greenhouse gas emissions and support other adaptation policies. Some marine ecosystems do not meet key criteria for inclusion within the Blue Carbon framework (e.g. fish, bivalves and coral reefs). Others have gaps in scientific understanding of carbon stocks or greenhouse gas fluxes, or currently there is limited potential for management or accounting for carbon sequestration (macroalgae and phytoplankton), but may be considered Blue Carbon ecosystems in the future, once these gaps are addressed.

AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A carbon budget for the northwest European continental shelf seas (NWES) was synthesized using available estimates for coastal, pelagic and benthic carbon stocks and flows. Key uncertainties were identified and the effect of future impacts on the carbon budget were assessed. The water of the shelf seas contains between 210 and 230 Tmol of carbon and absorbs between 1.3 and 3.3 Tmol from the atmosphere annually. Off-shelf transport and burial in the sediments account for 60-100 and 0-40% of carbon outputs from the NWES, respectively. Both of these fluxes remain poorly constrained by observations and resolving their magnitudes and relative importance is a key research priority. Pelagic and benthic carbon stocks are dominated by inorganic carbon. Shelf sediments contain the largest stock of carbon, with between 520 and 1600 Tmol stored in the top 0.1 m of the sea bed. Coastal habitats such as salt marshes and mud flats contain large amounts of carbon per unit area but their total carbon stocks are small compared to pelagic and benthic stocks due to their smaller spatial extent. The large pelagic stock of carbon will continue to increase due to the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2, with associated pH decrease. Pelagic carbon stocks and flows are also likely to be significantly affected by increasing acidity and temperature, and circulation changes but the net impact is uncertain. Benthic carbon stocks will be affected by increasing temperature and acidity, and decreasing oxygen concentrations, although the net impact of these interrelated changes on carbon stocks is uncertain and a major knowledge gap. The impact of bottom trawling on benthic carbon stocks is unique amongst the impacts we consider in that it is widespread and also directly manageable, although its net effect on the carbon budget is uncertain. Coastal habitats are vulnerable to sea level rise and are strongly impacted by management decisions. Local, national and regional actions have the potential to protect or enhance carbon storage, but ultimately global governance, via controls on emissions, has the greatest potential to influence the long-term fate of carbon stocks in the northwestern European continental shelf.

AB  - Across the globe, coastal wetland vegetation distributions are changing in response to climate change. In the southeastern United States, increased winter temperatures have resulted in poleward range expansion of mangroves into pure salt marsh habitat. Climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marsh will significantly alter carbon (C) storage capacity of these wetlands, which currently store the highest average C per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Total ecosystem C stocks were measured along a 342 km latitudinal gradient of mangrove - to - marsh dominance in Florida. Carbon stocks were quantified through measurements of above- and belowground biomass and soil C. Interior mangrove C stocks were greater than both salt marsh and ecotonal C stocks and soil C comprised the majority of each ecosystem C component (51-98%). The wetlands investigated in this study cover 38,532 ha, and store an average of 215 Mg of C ha(-1). Currently, mangroves cover 31% of the land area studied, storing 44% of the total C, whereas salt marshes occupy 68% of the wetland area and only store 55% of the C. Total conversion of salt marsh to mangrove may increase C storage by 26%, predominately due to increases in aboveground biomass.

AB  - The climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marshes could significantly alter the carbon (C) storage capacity of coastal wetlands, which have the highest average C storage per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems. Mangrove range expansion is occurring globally, but little is known about how these rapid climate-driven shifts may alter ecosystem C storage. Here, we quantify current C stocks in ecotonal wetlands across gradients of marsh- to mangrove-dominance, and use unique chronological maps of vegetation cover to estimate C stock changes from 2003 to 2010 in a 567-km(2) wildlife refuge in the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. We report that over the 7-yr. period, total wetland C stocks increased 22 % due to mangrove encroachment into salt marshes. Newly established mangrove stands stored twice as much C on a per area basis as salt marsh primarily due to differences in aboveground biomass, and mangrove cover increased by 69 % during this short time interval. Wetland C storage within the wildlife refuge increased at a rate of 2.7 Mg C ha(-1) yr.(-1), more than doubling the naturally high coastal wetland C sequestration rates. Mangrove expansion could account for a globally significant increase of terrestrial C storage, which may exert a considerable negative feedback on warming.

AB  - The loss of blue carbon ecosystems results in significant levels of carbon emissions and decreased supply of other ecosystem services. West Africa contains approximately 14% of the world's mangrove area but despite 25% of coverage loss between 1980 and 2006, the region's mangroves have not been well studied. This study aims to provide a first step toward increasing the knowledge of the region's blue carbon stocks, with a focus on mangroves, and of their financial value based on their carbon storage benefit alone. The best available data suggest that the region contains 1.97 million hectares of mangroves storing 854 million metric tons of carbon in above- and below-ground biomass and the top meter of soil; 4.8 million hectares of seagrass storing 673 million metric tons of carbon; and 1.2 million hectares of salt marshes storing 303 million metric tons of carbon. Even without including values for other benefits of intact mangroves, the conservation of mangroves in the region appears viable. Specifically, the discounted value of 20-year emission reductions under a conservation scenario is estimated to be between $341.2-569.0 million at an 8% discount rate and carbon prices of $3 and $5 per metric ton respectively.

AB  - Environmental water allocations are used to improve the ecological health of wetlands. There is now increasing demand for allocations to improve ecosystem productivity and respiration, and enhance carbon sequestration. Despite global recognition of wetlands as carbon sinks, information regarding carbon dynamics is lacking. This is the first study estimating carbon sequestration for semiarid Phragmites australis reedbeds. The study combined aboveground biomass assessments with stable isotope analyses of soils and modeling of biomass using Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the capacity of environmental water allocations to improve carbon storage. The study considered relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), carbon sources, and reedbed persistence in the Macquarie Marshes, a regulated semiarid floodplain of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. SOC storage levels to 1 m soil depth were higher in persistent reedbeds (167 Mg ha(-1)) than ephemeral reedbeds (116-138 Mg ha(-1)). In situ P. australis was the predominant source of surface SOC at persistent reedbeds; mixed sources of surface SOC were proposed for ephemeral reedbeds. C-13 enrichment with increasing soil depth occurred in persistent and ephemeral reedbeds and may not relate to flow characteristics. Despite high SOC at persistent reedbeds, differences in the rate of accretion contributed to significantly higher rates of carbon sequestration at ephemeral reedbeds (approximately 554 and 465 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to persistent reedbeds (5.17 g m(-2) yr(-1)). However, under current water regimes, rapid accretion at ephemeral reedbeds cannot be maintained. Effective management of persistent P. australis reedbeds may enhance carbon sequestration in the Macquarie Marshes and floodplain wetlands more generally.

AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems provide important and multiple ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation through carbon storage. However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C-org) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C-org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C-org stock((100 years))) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C-org ha(-1) in mangroves, 8-53 Mg C(org )ha(-1) in seagrasses and 32-56 Mg C-org ha(-1) in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8-426 g m(-2) yr(-1), 2-252 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 1-60 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Most of the stored C-org (60-86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C-org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900-1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased C-org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C-org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C-org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C-org through significant CO2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands store vast amounts of organic carbon, globally, and are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic sea level rise. To understand the effect of sea level rise on organic carbon fate and preservation in this global sink, it is necessary to characterize differences in the biogeochemical stability of coastal wetland soil organic carbon (SOC). Here we use ramped pyrolysis/oxidation decomposition characteristics as proxies for SOC stability to understand the fate of carbon storage in coastal wetlands comprising the Mississippi River deltaic plain, undergoing rapid rates of local sea level rise. Soils from three wetland types (fresh, brackish, and salt marshes) along a salinity gradient were subjected to ramped pyrolysis analysis to evaluate decomposition characteristics related to thermochemical stability of SOC. At equivalent soil depths, we observed that fresh marsh SOC was more stable than brackish and salt marsh SOC. Depth, isotopic, elemental, and chemical compositions, bulk density, and water content of SOC all exhibited different relationships with SOC stability across the marsh salinity gradient, indicative of different controls on SOC stability within each marsh type. The differences in stability imply stronger preservation potential of fresh marsh soil carbon, compared to that of salt and brackish marshes. Considering projected marsh ecosystem responses to sea level rise, these observed stability differences are important in planning and implementing coastal wetland carbon-focused remediation and improving climate model feedbacks with the carbon cycle. Specifically, our results imply that ecosystem changes associated with sea level rise will initiate the accumulation of less stable carbon in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Coastal regions, at the interface between terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems, play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles. This chapter reviews the climate regulation services of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) including tidal salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass beds, macroalgal forests, coral reefs, and coastal shelf ecosystems. ECEs regulate global and regional climates by sequestering or releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). ECEs are extremely productive biologically, with net primary production rates per unit area among the highest of any ecosystem. Consequently, ECEs play a globally significant role as carbon sinks, with carbon storage rates per unit area of many habitats far exceeding that of land habitats at the rate of about 10 times that of temperate terrestrial forests and 50 times that of tropical forests. Furthermore, sedimentation does not reach an equilibrium carbon balance as occurs in terrestrial systems, whose sequestration capacity is forecasted to decrease this century. Conversely, they are large potential sources of GHG's if disturbed or misman-aged. Critically, carbon sequestration in many coastal habitats is superior to that of terrestrial habitats, as carbon is generally stored over long time frames (thousands of years) as a consequence of the large belowground biomass and the absence of fire threat. Furthermore, carbon is generally broken down anaerobically; hence, emissions of other potent GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide are negligible. A review of literature provided sequestration rates for various coastal habitats. Using these in combination with global extent of selected habitats, this chapter finds that GHGs worldwide, mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes combine to sequester a minimum of 136 000 tonnes C annually into long-term carbon storage. Assuming prices of CO2 epsilon from $10 to $90 per tonne, the value of the annual sequestration is $5-45 billion. This is an underestimate due to data gaps and, the limited assessment of the area of these three coastal ecosystem habitats, and relates only to long-term storage. The figures do not include short-term carbon storage in biomass, and further unaccounted for carbon sequestration occurs in kelp forests, estuaries, and coastal shelf seas. Many ECEs are under threat globally from sea-level rise, coastal development, pollution, and other anthropogenic stressors, and protection and restoration of ECEs may be an important tool for mitigating climate change. Currently, these habitats are not included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) carbon accounting frameworks, and therefore are excluded from incentive schemes such as carbon markets and other incentive programs, but their inclusion deserves consideration due to their potential for mitigating global climate change. The global distribution of C sequestration in ECEs reveals that large areas of the tropics are home to the highest sequestration rates and occur in developing countries, which also have the highest rates of coastal habitat degradation. Schemes such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may bring revenues and added benefits to developing countries for instigating projects and marine protected areas for conservation.
   Many small island nations and developing countries in the tropics are particularly vulnerable to climate change and contain large swathes of seagrasses and mangroves compared to overall land area, but do not contain large areas of forests or grasslands, which would apply to REDD in its current form. Coastal habitats thus not only present an untapped potential for inclusion in climate change mitigation schemes, but also present a little-recognized risk of loss of large carbon stocks if their degradation and destruction are not reduced or halted.

AB  - The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3 m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217 +/- 60 Mg C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417 +/- 70 Mg C/ha for low marsh, 551 +/- 47 Mg C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064 +/- 38 Mg C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0-100 cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%-53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100 cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha(-1)), to mangrove (46 t ha(-1)), to seagrass (27 t ha(-1)) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha(-1)). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4% of the estuarine area and containing 57% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on delta C-13 and delta N-15 mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Salt marshes and seagrass meadows can sequester and store high quantities of organic carbon (OC) in their sediments relative to other marine and terrestrial habitats. Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast. In the top 20 cm of sediment, the salt marshes contained approximately twice as much OC as seagrass meadows did, 4.92 +/- 0.36 kg OC m(-2) compared to 2.20 +/- 0.24 kg OC m(-2), respectively. Both salt marsh and seagrass sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and US-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment. Rather, the vast majority of OC in sediment across sites was likely derived from planktonic/benthic diatoms and/or C-3 salt marsh plants.

AB  - Salt marshes (a type of coastal wetland with herbaceous plants) are one of the most productive ecosystems. The organic matter accumulated by plants, together with deposition of inorganic mineral sediments, contributes to vertical marsh growth and determines the marsh ability to cope with regional sea level rise. Deposition of mineral sediment, in turn, alters the growth of plant roots and shoots, and further marsh morphology and blue carbon storage. Based on mesocosm experiments simulating the sedimentation intensity, this paper examined the responses of Spartina alterniflora (a plant widely distributed in global salt marshes) to sediment deposition events (0-24 cm thicknesses). The plant height increased by 1.51 cm on average with 1 cm sediment deposition. New roots grew into the deposited sediment layers, resulting in a significant increase in the below-ground biomass. The below-ground biomass doubled with the treatment of 24 cm deposition thickness in comparison with that without deposition. The depth-dependent distribution of below-ground biomass changed from a monotonous (decreasing with soil depth) to a non-monotonic (increasing first and then decreasing) trend. This illustrates the growth of marsh plants in response to sediment deposition disturbance (similar to artificial or storm-induced sediment deposition) and have important implications for further investigations on marsh resiliency, blue carbon storage and marsh morphology.

AB  - The canopies and roots of seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarsh protect a legacy of buried sedimentary organic carbon from resuspension and remineralisation. This legacy's value, in terms of mitigating anthropogenic emissions of CO2, is based on total organic carbon (TOC) inventories to a depth likely to be disturbed. However, failure to subtract allochthonous recalcitrant carbon overvalues the storage service. Simply put, burial of oxidation-resistant organics formed outside of the ecosystem provides no additional protection from remineralisation. Here, we assess whether black carbon (BC), an allochthonous and recalcitrant form of organic carbon, is contributing to a significant overestimation of blue carbon stocks. To test this supposition, BC and TOC contents were measured in different types of seagrass and mangrove sediment cores across tropical and temperate regimes, with different histories of air pollution and fire together with a reanalysis of published data from a subtropical system. The results suggest current carbon stock estimates are positively biased, particularly for low-organiccontent sandy seagrass environs, by 18 +/- 3% (+/- 95% confidence interval) and 43 +/- 21% (+/- 95% CI) for the temperate and tropical regions respectively. The higher BC fractions appear to originate from atmospheric deposition and substantially enrich the relatively low TOC fraction within these environs.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities in New England salt marshes have altered hydrologic flows in various ways, but unintended consequences from some types of habitat modifications have received little attention. Specifically, ditches have existed on salt marshes for decades, but the effects of these hydrologic alterations are only poorly understood. Ditch-plugging is a more recent methodology used for salt marsh habitat enhancement and mosquito control, but the long-term effects from this management practice are also unclear. The interactions involving marsh surface elevation, soil characteristics, and hydrologic regimes result in feedbacks that regulate the salt marsh self-maintenance process, and these interactions vary with hydrologic modification. Using natural tidal creeks and pools as controls, we examined the effects of ditching and plugging, respectively, on hydrology, surface elevations, and soils. Results showed the most apparent effects of altered hydrology from ditching are prolonged pore-water retention in the rooting zone and significantly lower soil bulk density and mineral content when compared with natural creek habitat. From a management perspective, the important question is whether the combined alterations to physical and biological processes will hinder the marsh's ability to keep pace with increasing rates of sea level rise, especially in more heavily ditched marshes. In contrast, ditch-plugging results in the decoupling of feedback processes that promote salt marsh self-maintenance and in doing so, threatens marsh stability and resilience to climate change. High surface water levels, permanently saturated soils, marsh subsidence, and significantly lower bulk density, carbon storage, soil strength, and redox levels associated with hydrologic alterations from ditch-plugging all support this conclusion.

AB  - Efforts to incorporate blue carbon, the carbon associated with marine ecosystems, into carbon accounting and carbon markets are increasing. To fully leverage the capacity of marine ecosystems to sequester carbon requires information to guide prioritisation of coastal landscapes for conservation and regeneration. A comprehensive landscape-scale assessment of mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon requires information regarding vegetation cover, sedimentological and geomorphological factors. This information should also be integrated with socio-economic factors that alter natural processes of blue carbon accumulation and storage. The purpose of this study was to provide a framework for undertaking a first-pass assessment of blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency in coastal landscapes, and to incorporate socio-economic factors that will influence blue carbon storage in coastal landscapes. This was achieved using readily available datasets that were analysed using a raster-based approach to develop a proxy indication of biophysical and socio-economic factors relevant for mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon. The approach demonstrated that large catchments were associated with areas highly suitable for blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency. Small catchments associated with mature barrier estuaries had the highest proportional area that provides potential blue carbon ecosystem services and climate mitigation benefits. The qualitative approach used does not replace high-resolution quantitative assessments of blue carbon storage, flux and detailed site-specific assessment of socio-economic factors that may influence blue carbon services; however, it can be used to guide prioritisation of blue carbon landscapes for further assessment prior to conservation and/or regeneration.

AB  - Salt marshes can sequester large amounts of carbon in sediments, but the relation between carbon storage and exportation remains poorly understood. Groundwater exchange can flush sediment carbon to surface waters and potentially reduce storage. In this study, we estimated groundwater fluxes and associated carbon fluxes using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance and sediment carbon burial rates using lead (Pb-210) in a pristine salt marsh (North Inlet, SC, USA). We used delta C-13 to trace carbon origins. We found that groundwater releases large amounts of carbon to the open ocean. These groundwater fluxes have the potential to export 7.2 +/- 5.5 g m(-2) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), 0.2 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 0.7 +/- 0.5 g m(-2) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per day. The fluxes exceed the average surface water CO2 emissions (0.6 +/- 0.2 g m(-2) day(-1)) and the average sediment carbon burial rates (0.17 +/- 0.09 g m(-2) day(-1)). The delta C-13 results suggest that groundwater carbon originated from salt marsh soils, while the sediment carbon source is derived from salt marsh vegetation. We propose that the impact of salt marshes in carbon cycling depends not only on their capacity to bury carbon in sediments, but also on their high potential to export carbon to the ocean via groundwater pathways.

AB  - Anaerobic decomposition in wetland soils is carried out by several interacting microbial processes that influence carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions. To understand the role of wetlands in the global carbon cycle, it is critical to understand how differences in both electron donor (i.e., organic carbon) and terminal electron acceptor (TEA) availability influence anaerobic mineralization of soil organic matter. In this study we manipulated electron donors and acceptors to examine how these factors influence total rates of carbon mineralization and the pathways of microbial respiration (e.g., sulfate reduction versus methanogenesis). Using a field-based reciprocal transplant of soils from brackish and freshwater tidal marshes, in conjunction with laboratory amendments of TEAs, we examined how rates of organic carbon mineralization changed when soils with different carbon contents were exposed to different TEAs. Total mineralization (the sum of CO2 + CH4 produced) on a per gram soil basis was greater in the brackish marsh soils, which had higher soil organic matter content: however, on a per gram carbon basis, mineralization was greater in the freshwater soils, suggesting that the quality of carbon inputs from the freshwater plants was higher. Overall anaerobic metabolism was higher for both soil types incubated at the brackish site where SO42- was the dominant TEA. When soils were amended with TEAs in the laboratory, more thermodynamically favorable respiration pathways typically resulted in greater organic matter mineralization (Fe(III) respiration > SO42- reduction > methanogenesis). These results suggest that both electron donors and acceptors play important roles in regulating anaerobic microbial mineralization of soil organic matter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes sequester and store blue carbon at both short and long time scales. Marsh soils shape and maintain the ecosystem by supporting complex biogeochemical reactions, deposition of sediment, and accumulation of organic matter. In this study, we examined the potential of imaging spectroscopy techniques to indirectly quantify and map tidal marsh soil properties at a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Georgia, USA. A framework was developed to combine modern digital image processing techniques for marsh soil mapping, including object-based image analysis (OBIA), machine learning modeling, and ensemble analysis. We also evaluated the efficacy of airborne hyperspectral sensors in estimating marsh soil properties compared to spaceborne multispectral sensors, WorldView-2 and QuickBird. The pros and cons of object-based modeling and mapping were assessed and compared with traditional pixel-based mapping methods. The results showed that the designed framework was effective in quantifying and mapping three marsh soil properties using the composite reflectance from salt marsh environment: soil salinity, soil water content, and soil organic matter content. Multispectral sensors were successful in quantifying soil salinity and soil water content but failed to model soil organic matter. The study also demonstrated the value of minimum noise fraction transformation and ensemble analysis techniques for marsh soil mapping. The results suggest that imaging spectroscopy based modeling is a promising tool to quantify and map marsh soil properties at a local scale, and is a potential alternative to traditional soil data acquisition to support carbon cycle research and the conservation and restoration of tidal marshes.

AB  - Predators continue to be harvested unsustainably throughout most of the Earth's ecosystems. Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of 'blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.

AB  - As an important component of global change, plant invasion threaten the sustainability of global ecosystems and may alter the carbon dynamics in the invaded area. Knowledge of the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks and their profile distribution is limited in coastal salt marshes, which are referred as important "blue carbon" ecosystems. A short-term invasion chronosequence of 2-10 years was used to evaluate the responses of SOC and SIC over the invasion period in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The C-13 isotope content was analyzed in soil, plant tissue, and sediment debris to infer the contribution of invasion to SOC accumulation in the invaded salt marshes. The results showed that more than 80% of the soil C was inorganic, and this percentage was higher in native sites and in the newly invaded areas. SOC accumulated linearly with the invasive time in the top 100 cm soil. The SOC accumulation rate varied along the soil profile, and was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.40 kg C m(-2) yr(-1) in the top 20cm, 40cm, 100cm soils, respectively. The C-13 isotope analysis demonstrated that debris-derived C was dominant in the native salt marshes (62.2% on average), while plant-derived C increased with the invasive time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the SIC loss in the top 40 cm with invasion could be indirectly attributed to the soil acidification in the alkaline soil and directly related to soil Ca loss. Our results also suggested that SIC loss would partially offset the CO2 sequestration associated with SOC burial caused by the invasion. This work indicates causal relationships between plant invasions and soil carbon pools and highlights the nonnegligible importance of inorganic C in coastal blue carbon budgets.

AB  - During the strong El Nino event of 2015-2016 large-scale dieback of mangrove forests was observed in the Gulf of Carpentaria region of northern Australia. These and other intertidal communities are also extensive along the 7,400 km coastline of north-eastern Australia. Determination of their floristic composition, potential carbon (C) store and sequestration capacity, and vulnerability to climate extremes is required for their effective conservation management and was the aim of this study. Standardized, state-wide quantitative classification methods identified five mangrove forest and three saltmarsh communities covering 2,604 km(2)along this coastline. Estuarine and oceanic mangrove forests were mapped separately. Carbon storage and sequestration capacity of the intertidal communities and their vulnerability to strong El Nino events were estimated using published data and GIS analyses. An estimated potential 126.2 (+/- 27.3 SEM) Tg C and 8.3 (+/- 0.4 SD) Tg C were stored in the mangrove forests and saltmarshes, respectively. Comparatively, the rainforests of the region stored an estimated equivalent amount of C but covered three times the area, and the most widespread woodlands (Eucalyptus tetrodonta) of the region stored an estimated 1.5 times the C but covered 16 times the area. The C stored in the intertidal communities was estimated as equivalent to 493.47 Tg of CO(2,)valued at AU$6.8 billion on the Australian carbon market in December 2018. Annual C sequestration potential was 0.18-0.34 Tg C/year, valued between AU$8.9 and $17 million. Approximately 360 ha of mangrove forest was estimated as lost because of dieback during the 2015-16 El Nino event. Three types of mangrove forest were identified as potentially vulnerable to dieback from El Nino-driven climate events. This study highlights the national and global significance of these intertidal systems and our findings need to be incorporated in future conservation and development planning of northern Australia.

AB  - In North America, the dynamic ecotonal boundary between mangrove and salt marsh is currently fluctuating in response to freeze-free winters, which can cause rapid alterations in a number of wetland processes and attributes. Permanent plots were established in pure salt marsh habitat along the Atlantic coast of Florida in 2015, and by 2018, mangrove saplings had encroached into plots. In this study, above- and belowground biomass measurements and soil C in the top 10-cm soil profile were quantified in 2018 and compared to 2015 data to better understand the effects of mangrove encroachment on C storage in salt marsh habitat. Plant and soil fractions were tested for C-13 stable isotopic signatures to elucidate soil C sources. In 3 years, mangrove biomass increased dramatically and soil C doubled in pure salt marsh plots, consequently increasing total C in the system. Soil organic matter increased, while there was no change in soil C:N. C-13 values suggest that soil C was derived mainly from salt marsh soil organic matter, especially that of belowground, rather than aboveground biomass. These results provide real-time, quantitative data on the encroachment of mangroves into salt marshes over a relatively short period of time.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The rapid spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the mangrove ecosystems of China was reduced using Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. as an ecological replacement. Here, we studied the effects of invasion and ecological replacement using S. apetala on soil organic carbon fractions and stock on Qi'ao Island. Materials and Methods: Seven sites, including unvegetated mudflat and S. alterniflora, rehabilitated mangroves with different ages (one, six, and 10 years) and mature native Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu, and Yong areas were selected in this study. Samples in the top 50 cm of soil were collected and then different fractions of organic carbon, including the total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), soil water dissolved carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and the total carbon stock were measured and calculated. Results: The growth of S. alterniflora and mangroves significantly increased the soil TOC, POC, and MBC levels when compared to the mudflat. S. alterniflora had the highest soil DOC contents at 0-10 cm and 20-30 cm and the one-year restored mangroves had the highest MBC content. S. alterniflora and mangroves both had higher soil total carbon pools than the mudflat. Conclusions: The invasive S. alterniflora and young S. apetala forests had significantly lower soil TOC and POC contents and total organic carbon than the mature K. obovata on Qi'ao Island. These results indicate that ecological replacement methods can enhance long term carbon storage in Spartina-invaded ecosystems and native mangrove species are recommended.

AB  - The persistence of salt marshes in the landscape depends on their ability to accommodate rising sea level and minimize additional flooding stress. We use sediment cores and water level data from 14 marshes in Connecticut and New York to evaluate how marsh accretion, mineral and organic accumulation, carbon storage, and hydroperiod have changed from 1900 to 2012. We observe a regional acceleration in marsh accretion beginning around 1940, although marsh accretion did not reach parity with sea level rise for several additional decades. Despite a rise in marsh accretion from 1.0 mm yr(-1) circa 1900 to 3.6 mm yr(-1) at present, the marsh surface has lost elevation relative to tidal datums. Declining relative elevations have led to increased tidal flooding, particularly in high marsh settings. As flooding increased, organic matter accumulation accelerated at all marshes. Accelerating mineral deposition was only observed in areas of short-form Spartina alterniflora. Mineral and organic sediment accumulation co-limit accretion, but organic accumulation was the stronger limiting factor, suggesting that marsh response to sea level rise in the region is sensitive to processes affecting rates of belowground production and decomposition. Marsh carbon storage over the period of study averaged 84 g C m(-2) yr(-1), increasing as accretion accelerated. If marshes remain spatially intact as sea levels rise, these results suggest that marshes have the capacity to become even greater C sinks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organic carbon sequestration in salt marsh soils is a function of factors that influence both spatial variability and chemical stability of accumulating carbon. Refractory carbon (slowly decomposed) may be the most important in terms of long-term sequestration and is widely referred to in models of carbon storage; however, little information exists about the quantity and variability of refractory carbon accumulation in marshes. In this study, total (CT), labile (CL) and refractory (CR) organic carbon accumulation rates were measured for Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes representing different geomorphological settings with a range of vertical accretion rates. Three 50-cm long cores were collected in each of three marshes in Barnegat Bay and three marshes in Delaware Estuary, USA. Rates of C accumulation were calculated using Cesium-137 dating and the relative stability of soil organic carbon was quantified using acid-hydrolysis. CT accumulation ranged over fourfold among marshes from 72 to 346 g m(-2) yr(-1). CT and CL accumulation increased with increasing mineral sediment accumulation, while CR accumulation was uniform across cores averaging 78 5 g m(-2) yr(-1). Similar rates of CR accumulation across marsh areas with different accretion and mineral sediment accumulation rates was associated with a decline in the CR:Ci. density ratio as mineral volume increased. Our results suggest that carbon accumulation is higher in salt marshes with higher mineral sedimentation due, primarily, to the burial of labile carbon, and that there is a limit on the rate of chemically recalcitrant carbon accumulation in marsh soils.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

AB  - The work was conducted at La Pletera salt marsh (NE Spain) to investigate the potential for atmospheric carbon capture of perennial Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0-5 and 5-20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground (aC), belowground (bC) and litter (lC) carbon were 2300%, 350% and 3000% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon (SOC) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0-5 cm depth with 17.07 +/- 5.83 g kg(-1) than S. patula soil with 5.89 +/- 1.68 g kg(-1), namely 189% increase. Similarly, SOC increased by 109% in S. fruticosa soil at 5-20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) was 292% and 182% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower SOC and GRSP affected the soil aggregate stability (WSA) in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125% and 175% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The PCA further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration with enhanced stable carbon storage has been widely accepted as a very important ecosystem property. Yet, the link between carbon stability and bioactivity for ecosystem functioning with OC accumulation in field soils has not been characterized. We assessed the changes in microbial activity versus carbon stability along a paddy soil chronosequence shifting from salt marsh in East China. We used mean weight diameter, normalized enzyme activity (NEA) and carbon gain from straw amendment for addressing soil aggregation, microbial biochemical activity and potential C sequestration, respectively. In addition, a response ratio was employed to infer the changes in all analyzed parameters with prolonged rice cultivation. While stable carbon pools varied with total SOC accumulation, soil respiration and both bacterial and fungal diversity were relatively constant in the rice soils. Bacterial abundance and NEA were positively but highly correlated to total SOC accumulation, indicating an enhanced bio-activity with carbon stabilization. This could be linked to an enhancement of particulate organic carbon pool due to physical protection with enhanced soil aggregation in the rice soils under long-term rice cultivation. However, the mechanism underpinning these changes should be explored in future studies in rice soils where dynamic redox conditions exist.

AB  - The rapid expansion of Phragmites australis in brackish marshes of the East Coast of the USA has drawn much attention, because it may change vegetation diversity and ecosystem functions. In particular, higher primary production of Phragmites than that of other native species such as Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus has been noted, suggesting possible changes in carbon storage potential in salt marshes. To better understand the long-term effect of the invasion of Phragmites on carbon storage, however, information on decomposition rates of soil organic matter is essential. To address this issue, we compared microbial enzyme activities and microbial functional gene abundances (fungi, laccase, denitrifier, and methanogens) in three depths of soils with three different plants in a brackish marsh in Maryland, USA. Laccase and phenol oxidase activities were measured to assess the decomposition potential of recalcitrant carbon while beta-glucosidase activity was determined as proxy for cellulose decomposition rate. Microbial activities near the surface (0-15 cm) were the highest in Spartina-community sites followed by Phragmitesand Schoenoplectus-community sites. A comparison of stable isotopic signatures (delta 13C and delta 15N) of soils and plant leaves suggests that deep organic carbon in the soils mainly originated from Spartina, and only the surface soils may have been influenced by Phragmites litter. In contrast, fungal, laccase, and denitrifier abundances determined by realtime qPCR exhibited no discernible patterns among the surface soils of the three vegetation types. However, the abundance of methanogens was higher in the deep Phragmites-community soil. Therefore, Phragmites invasion will accelerate CH4 emission by greater CH4 production in deep soils with abundant methanogens, although enzymatic mechanisms revealed the potential for larger C accumulation by Phragmites invasion in salt marshes in the east coast of the USA.

AB  - Recognition of the potential for vegetated coastal ecosystems to store and sequester carbon has led to their increasing inclusion into global carbon budgets and carbon offset schemes. However, kelp forests have been overlooked in evaluations of this 'blue carbon', which have been limited to tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds. We determined the continental-scale contribution to blue carbon from kelp forests in Australia using areal extent, biomass, and productivity measures from across the entire Great Southern Reef. We reveal that these kelp forests represent 10.3-22.7 Tg C and contribute 1.3-2.8 Tg C year(-1) in sequestered production, amounting to more than 30% of total blue carbon stored and sequestered around the Australian continent, and similar to 3% of the total global blue carbon. We conclude that the omission of kelp forests from blue carbon assessments significantly underestimates the carbon storage and sequestration potential from vegetated coastal ecosystems globally.

AB  - The ongoing increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is changing the global marine environment and is causing warming and acidification of the oceans. Reduction of CO2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a CO2 sink via photosynthesis and CaCO3 dissolution and act as a CO2 source during respiration and CaCO3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 900 g CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 x 10(9) t C yr(-1). Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae (CCA) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm ky r(-1). Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/CCA was 0.4/1.2 x 10(9) t C yr(-1) suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 x 10(9) tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantified but significant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.

AB  - Ecosystem processes are tightly linked to the structure and functioning of plant communities. Large-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora on unvegetated intertidal mudflats is expected to reduce atmospheric CO2 through an increase in the carbon storage of coastal ecosystem. In China's Yancheng Natural Reserve, plant carbon storage (PCS), soil total organic carbon storage (SCS), as well as CO2 and CH4 fluxes, were compared between Spartina invaded marsh and adjacent native marshes. PCS of Spartina marsh was 16.9 and 1.4 times higher compared to those of Suaeda and Phragmites marshes, whereas relatively larger aboveground PCS but smaller belowground PCS were found in the newly settled seaward margin of the Spartina marsh. SCS in Spartina marsh was also 1.5 times higher than that in unvegetated mudflat. Although Spartina vegetation assimilated a substantial amount of CO2, mass emission of CH4 from the invaded marsh was also noticed, especially in summer, it was 9-16 times higher than those from native marshes. Our study indicates that instead of CO2 being simply incorporated into PCS and SCS, carbon dynamics following Spartina invasion are more complicated. Detailed studies of CH4 emissions are needed before ascertaining whether, and to what degree, the invasion of S. alterniflora may affect the global warming process.

AB  - Production of belowground organic matter is critical to sustainability of salt marshes. It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the StLawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.

AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the soil carbon storage and sequestration rates of undisturbed natural wetlands and disturbed wetlands subject to restriction of tidal flow and subsequent rehabilitation in an Australian estuary. Disturbed and undisturbed estuarine wetlands of the Hunter estuary, New South Wales, Australia were selected as the study sites for this research. Vertical accretion rates of estuarine substrates were combined with soil carbon concentrations and bulk densities to determine the carbon store and carbon sequestration rates of the substrates tested. Relationships between estuary water level, soil evolution and vertical accretion were also examined. The carbon sequestration rate of undisturbed wetlands was lower (15% for mangrove and 55% for saltmarsh) than disturbed wetlands, but the carbon store was higher (65% for mangrove and 60% for saltmarsh). The increased carbon sequestration rate of the disturbed wetlands was driven by substantially higher rates of vertical accretion (95% for mangrove and 345% for saltmarsh). Estuarine wetland carbon stores were estimated at 700-1000 Gg C for the Hunter estuary and 3900-5600 Gg C for New South Wales. Vertical accretion and carbon sequestration rates of estuarine wetlands in the Hunter are at the lower end of the range reported in the literature. The comparatively high carbon sequestration rates reported for the disturbed wetlands in this study indicate that wetland rehabilitation has positive benefits for regulation of atmospheric carbon concentrations, in addition to more broadly accepted ecosystem services.

AB  - Salt marshes accrete both organic and inorganic sediments. Here we present analytical and numerical models of salt marsh sedimentation that, in addition to capturing inorganic processes, explicitly account for above- and belowground organic processes including root growth and decay of organic carbon. The analytical model is used to examine the bias introduced by organic processes into proxy records of sedimentation, namely Cs-137 and Pb-210. We find that accretion rates estimated using Pb-210 will be less than accretion rates estimated using the Cs-137 peak in steadily accreting marshes if (1) carbon decay is significant and (2) data for Pb-210 extend below the Cs-137 peak. The numerical model expands upon the analytical model by including belowground processes such as compaction and root growth, and by explicitly tracking the evolution of aboveground biomass and its effect on sedimentation rates. Using the numerical model we explore how marsh stratigraphy responds to sediment supply and the rate of sea-level rise. It is calibrated and tested using an extensive data set of both marsh stratigraphy and measurements of vegetation dynamics in a Spartina alterniflora marsh in South Carolina, USA. We find that carbon accumulation in marshes is nonlinearly related to both the supply of inorganic sediment and the rate of sea-level rise: carbon accumulation increases with sea-level rise until sea-level rise reaches a critical rate that drowns the marsh vegetation and halts carbon accumulation. The model predicts that changes in carbon storage resulting from changing sediment supply or sea-level rise are strongly dependent on the background sediment supply: if inorganic sediment supply is reduced in an already sediment poor marsh the storage of organic carbon will increase to a far greater extent than in a sediment-rich marsh, provided that the rate of sea-level rise does not exceed a threshold. These results imply that altering sediment supply to estuaries (e.g., by damming upstream rivers or altering littoral sediment transport) could lead to significant changes in the carbon budgets of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - The scarcity of data on tidal marsh soil accumulation rates (SAR) and soil organic carbon accumulation rates (CAR) globally precludes a comprehensive assessment of the role of tidal marshes in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Particularly few data exist from the southern hemisphere and for Australia in particular, which contains similar to 24% of globally recognised tidal marsh extent. Here we estimate SAR and CAR over the last 70 years using Pb-210-based geochronologies in temperate estuarine tidal marsh ecosystems in southern Western Australia (WA). Specifically, we assessed tidal marsh ecosystems situated in two geomorphic settings (marine vs. fluvial deltas) within 10 wave-dominated, barrier estuaries. Overall, average SAR (1.1 +/- 0.3 mm yr(-1)) and CAR (32 +/- 9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) estimates were 5-fold lower than global mean estimates. Furthermore, we showed that hotspots of soil organic carbon stocks are not indicative of current hotspots for CAR. The lack of significant differences (P > 0.05) in SAR, CAR, and excess Pb-210 inventories between marine and fluvial settings can be explained by the high heterogeneity among and within estuaries throughout the region. The relative stability of recent and Holocene relative sea-levels in WA likely explains the limited CAR potential in tidal marshes under relatively stable sea-level conditions. However, further research exploring interactions among biotic and abiotic factors within estuaries is required to shed more light on the small spatial-scale variability in SAR and CAR across tidal marsh ecosystems in WA and elsewhere. This study provides baseline estimates for the inclusion of tidal marshes in national carbon inventories, identifies hotspots for the development of blue carbon projects, and supports the use of site-specific assessments opposed to regional means for estimating blue carbon resources.

AB  - The highly visible coastal phenomenon of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana (LA) was examined through the prism of carbon accumulation and loss. Carbon storage or sequestration in rapidly subsiding LA coastal marsh soils was based on vertical marsh accretion and aerial change data. Marshes sequester significant amount of carbon through vertical accretion however, large amounts of carbon previously sequestration in the soil profile is lost through annual deterioration of these coastal marshes. Hurricanes, such as Katrina and Rita, have triggered instantaneous large carbon losses of sequestered soil carbon through the destruction of large areas of marsh. This analysis shows proposed coastal restoration efforts will not be sufficient to restore carbon losses by storms and marsh deterioration. Further, we have estimated the economic benefit of carbon sequestration for coastal wetland restoration efforts. Results show that LA coastal marshes may not serve as a net sink of carbon. These results may serve as a predictor of the impact of future predictions of increasing global sea level rise on carbon sequestration for other coastal regions.

AB  - Blue carbon refers to the considerable amounts of carbon sequestered by mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes and other coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems. At the present time, carbon market mechanisms to compensate those conserving blue carbon ecosystems, and thus reducing carbon emissions, are not yet in place. The ecosystem services provided by coastal vegetated ecosystems extend beyond their carbon storage capacity, and include their contribution to fishery production; shoreline protection; provision of habitat for wildlife and migratory species; flood water attenuation; nutrient cycling, pollution buffering; as well as their cultural, spiritual, subsistence and recreational uses. Because these services are of high economic, social and cultural value, the management and protection of blue carbon ecosystems could build collaboration between climate change and biodiversity practitioners on the national and international level. Such collaboration would also allow for the transfer of lessons learned from coastal management and conservation activities to carbon mitigation projects, and would include the need to work closely together with indigenous peoples and local communities. Resulting management activities on the local level could utilize and strengthen traditional knowledge and management systems related to blue carbon ecosystems, and increase both the resilience of biodiversity and that of coastal communities, as well as provide for long-term storage of blue carbon. While the challenge of scaling up local initiatives remains, some concrete examples already exist, such as the network of locally-managed marine areas (LMMAs) in the Pacific and beyond.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing numerous services such as soil carbon storage, flood protection and nutrient filtering, several of which are mediated by the sediment microbiome associated with marsh vegetation. Here, nutrient filtering (nitrate removal through denitrification) was examined by determining microbial (bacteria and archaea) community structure (16S rRNA gene iTag sequencing), diversity, denitrification rates and metabolic potential (assembled metagenomic sequences) in collocated patches of Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) and Juncus roemerianus (Juncus) sediments. The iTag data showed that diversity and richness in Spartina and Juncus sediment microbial communities were highly similar. However, microbial community evenness differed significantly, with the most even communities observed in Juncus sediments. Further, denitrification rates were significantly higher in Juncus compared to Spartina, suggesting oscillations in microbial abundances and in particular the core microbiome identified herein, along with plant diversity influence marsh nitrogen (N) removal. Amplicon and assembled metagenome sequences pointed to a potentially important, yet unappreciated Planctomycetes role in N removal in the salt marsh. Thus, ecosystem perturbations that alter marsh vegetation distribution could impact microbial diversity and may ultimately influence the ecologically important ecosystem functions the marsh sediment microbiome provides.

AB  - Backbarrier saltmarshes are considered carbon sinks; however, barrier island transgression and the associated processes of erosion and overwash are typically not included in coastal carbon budgets. Here, we present a carbon-budget model for transgressive barrier islands that includes a dynamic carbon-storage term, driven by backbarrier-marsh width, and a carbon-export term, driven by ocean and backbarrier shoreline erosion. To examine the impacts of storms, human disturbances and the backbarrier setting of a transgressive barrier island on carbon budgets and reservoirs, the model was applied to sites at Core Banks and Onslow Beach, NC, USA. Results show that shoreline erosion and burial of backbarrier marsh from washover deposition and dredge-spoil disposal temporarily transitioned each site into a net exporter (source) of carbon. The magnitude of the carbon reservoir was linked to the backbarrier setting of an island. Carbon reservoirs of study sites separated from the mainland by only backbarrier marsh (no lagoon) decreased for over a decade because carbon storage could not keep pace with erosion. With progressive narrowing of the backbarrier marsh, these barriers will begin to function more persistently as carbon sources until the reservoir is depleted at the point where the barrier welds with the mainland. Undeveloped barrier islands with wide lagoons are carbon sources briefly during erosive periods; however, at century time scales are net carbon importers (sinks) because new marsh habitat can form during barrier rollover. Human development on backbarrier saltmarsh serves to reduce the carbon storage capacity and can hasten the transition of an island from a sink to a source.

AB  - Salt marshes provide critical ecosystem services including some of the highest rates of carbon storage on Earth. However, many salt marshes receive very high nutrient loads and there is a growing body of evidence indicating that this nutrient enrichment alters carbon cycle processes. While many restoration plans prioritize nutrient management in their efforts to conserve salt marsh ecosystems, there has been little empirical investigation of the capacity for carbon cycle processes to recover once nutrient loading is reduced. To address this, we compared rates of greenhouse gas fluxes (i.e., CO2 and methane) measured using static chambers, and soil organic matter decomposition, using both litter bags and the Tea Bag Index (TBI), during the last two years of a long-term, ecosystem-scale nutrient enrichment experiment (2015-2016) as well as in the first two years of recovery post-enrichment (2017-2018). We found that both ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and decomposition processes (i.e., rhizome decomposition and soil organic matter stabilization) were enhanced by nutrient enrichment, but returned to reference ecosystem levels within the first year following the cessation of nutrient enrichment and remained at reference levels in the second year. These results suggest that management practices intended to reduce nutrient loads in coastal systems may, in fact, allow for rapid recovery of carbon cycle processes, potentially restoring the high carbon sequestration rates of these blue carbon ecosystems.

AB  - Predictions of how salt marsh primary production and carbon storage will respond to environmental change can be improved through detailed datasets documenting responses to real-world environmental variation. To address a shortage of detailed studies of natural variation, we examined drivers of Spartina alterniflora stem allometry and productivity in seven marshes across three regions in southern Louisiana. Live-stem allometry varied spatially and seasonally, generally with short stems weighing more (and tall stems weighing less) in the summer and fall, differences that persist even after correcting for flowering. Strong predictive relationships exist between allometry parameters representing emergent stem mass and mass accumulation rates, suggesting that S.alterniflora populations navigate a trade-off between larger mass at emergence and faster rates of biomass accumulation. Aboveground production and belowground production were calculated using five and four approaches, respectively. End-of-season aboveground biomass was a poor proxy for increment-based production measures. Aboveground production (Smalley) ranged from 390 to 3,350gm(-2)year(-1) across all marshes and years. Belowground production (max-min) was on average three times higher than aboveground; total production ranged from 1,400 to 8,500gm(-2)year(-1). Above- and belowground production were both positively correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations and negatively correlated to salinity. Synthesis: Interannual variation in water quality is sufficient to drive above- and belowground productivity. The positive relationship between nutrients and belowground production indicates that inputs of nutrients and freshwater may increase salt marsh carbon storage and ecosystem resilience to sea level rise.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are known for high carbon storage within their sediments, but our understanding of the variation in carbon storage among intertidal habitats, particularly over geomorphological settings and along elevation gradients, is limited. Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of similar to 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger OC stocks (175-504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44-271 Mg/ha). Variation in OC stocks among nonriverine sites was high in comparison with riverine and mixed geomorphic settings, with sites closer to riverine outflow from the east and south of Moreton Bay having higher stocks than those located on the sand islands in the northwest of the bay. Sediment OC stocks increased with elevation within nonriverine settings, but not in riverine geomorphic settings. Sediment OC stocks did not differ between mangrove and saltmarsh habitats. OC stocks did, however, differ between dominant species across the research area and within geomorphic settings. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of the South East Queensland catchments (17,792 ha) are comprised of approximately 4,100,000-5,200,000 Mg of sediment OC. Comparatively high variation in OC storage between riverine and nonriverine geomorphic settings indicates that the availability of mineral sediments and terrestrial derived OC may exert a strong influence over OC storage potential across intertidal wetland systems.

AB  - Increasing attention in global blue carbon investigation in these contemporary times, salt marsh has the distinctive importance in coastal ecosystems. We examined sediment organic carbon stock in the four dominant salt marsh species areas viz. Suaeda maritima, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Salicornia brachiata from Tuticorin, southeast coast of India in two seasons i.e. dry (July 2015) and wet season (January 2016). We examined above ground (AGB) and below ground biomass (BGB), sediment physico-chemical properties like pH, BD, composition, OM%, C-org%, C and N%, sediment organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and multivariate analysis on studied variables. Maximum AGB was recorded in A. indicum in both dry and wet season (10.91 +/- 0.15g/cm(2) and 14.87 +/- 0.68g/cm(2)). The highest BGB was observed in S. maritima in both seasons, as 2.01 +/- 0.35g/cm(2) and 4.49 +/- 0.35g/cm(2), respectively. The OM percentage ranged between 4.13 +/-.083 and 7.23 +/-.088% and the highest was observed in the wet season from S. maritima. Sediment organic stocks (Mgha (-1)) ranged from 8.42 +/-.640 to 54.46 +/- 1.46Mgha (-1) reflects nearly 7 times higher than the dry season. The present study can be useful for the estimation of blue carbon budgets in tropical coastal ecosystem since this type was the first hand information from this area.

AB  - Two transects were established across submerging coastal landscapes in Dorchester County, Maryland. Extensive sampling protocol was performed along the submerging upland tidal marsh soils to model C sequestration. Coastal marsh soils are accreting vertically and migrating laterally over the low-lying forest soils to keep pace with sealevel rise. The predictive C sequestration model was a two-step linear function. Therefore, C sequestration will continue to occur by accumulation in the organic horizons and sea-level rise is the driving force. During the last 150 yr, the rate of C sequestration averaged 83.5 +/- 23 g m(-2) yr(-1). Before the last few hundred years, the predicted longterm rate of C sequestration averaged 29.2 +/- 5.35 g m(-2) yr(-1). Sampling protocol and model validation ascertain the validity of the model and placed 80% confidence and 10% accuracy on rates of C sequestration and the predictive model. The model indicated that coastal marsh soils have higher C storage capacity than upland forest soils, and soils in the Cumulic subgroup of Mollisols. In general, C storage in mineral soils tends to reach a steady-state condition, whereas C sequestration in coastal marsh soils is a continuous phenomenon. During the next century, future C sequestration in the newly formed coastal marsh soils averaged 400 +/- 162 g m(-2) yr(-1). Modeling C sequestration in coastal marsh ecosystems indicated that C storage under positive accretionary balance acts as a negative feedback mechanism to global warming.

AB  - Freshwater marshes are prevalent in North America, yet their soil carbon stocks remain poorly quantified. To better understand these stocks, and rates of carbon accumulation over short and long timescales, we synthesize available data on soil properties and rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes in the temperate region of North America. Our findings suggest that freshwater marshes are not defined consistently, and that wetland classification schemes may undervalue presumed carbon stocks in freshwater marsh soils. Rates of carbon accumulation in freshwater marshes are often measured over recent time scales (last 50-100 years); these short-term rates are on average (+/- SD) 155 +/- 74 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in temperate North America. Long-term rates of carbon accumulation (measured over centuries and millennia) are on average 51 +/- 38 g C m(-2) yr(-1) yet infrequently measured. Our synthesis of rates of carbon accumulation and vertical accretion, bulk densities, and organic carbon contents suggests that freshwater marshes are accumulating carbon at comparable rates to salt marshes over short timescales and temperate peatlands over longer timescales. These timescales need to be clearly defined in order to improve estimates of the capacity for freshwater marshes to be net carbon sinks presently and in the future.

AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a mean plant carbon content of 44.1% (n = 1384, 95% C.I. = 43.99%-44.37%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822 Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent as well.

AB  - Salt marsh structure and function, and consequently ability to support a range of species and to provide ecosystem services, may be affected by climate change. To better understand how salt marshes will respond to warming and associated shifts in precipitation, we conducted a manipulative experiment in a tidal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. We exposed two plant communities (one dominated by Spartina patens-Distichlis spicata and one dominated by short form Spartina alterniflora) to five climate manipulations: warming via passive open-topped chambers, doubled precipitation, warming and doubled precipitation, extreme drought via rainout shelter, and ambient conditions. Modest daytime warming increased total aboveground biomass of the S. alterniflora community (24%), but not the S. patens-D. spicata community. Warming also increased maximum stem heights of S. alterniflora (8%), S. patens (8%), and D. spicata (15%). Decomposition was marginally accelerated by warming in the S. alterniflora community. Drought markedly increased total biomass of the S. alterniflora community (53%) and live S. patens (69%), perhaps by alleviating waterlogging of sediments. Decomposition was accelerated by increased precipitation and slowed by drought, particularly in the S. patens-D. spicata community. Flowering phenology responded minimally to the treatments, and pore water salinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations showed no treatment effects in either plant community. Our results suggest that these salt marsh communities may be resilient to modest amounts of warming and large changes in precipitation. If production increases under climate change, marshes will have a greater ability to keep pace with sea-level rise, although an increase in decomposition could offset this. As long as marshes are not inundated by flooding due to sea-level rise, increases in aboveground biomass and stem heights suggest that marshes may continue to export carbon and nutrients to coastal waters and may be able to increase their carbon storage capability by increasing plant growth under future climate conditions.

AB  - We report the results of a 5-year fertilization experiment in a central Long Island Sound salt marsh, aimed at understanding the impacts of high nutrient loads on marsh elevational processes. Fertilization with nitrogen led to some significant changes in marsh processes, specifically increases in aboveground primary production and in CO2 fluxes from the soil. However, neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss (relative to controls), reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production, all of which have been proposed as links between elevated nutrient loads and marsh drowning. Our data suggest that high nutrient levels increase gross carbon loss from the sediment, but that this is compensated for by other processes, leading to no net deleterious effect of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability with respect to sea level rise.

AB  - Blue carbon science requires the estimates of organic carbon stock and sequestration rate; however, holistic data analysis remains limited in South Korea. The present study reports current organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates in the coastal areas of West Sea, South Sea, and East Sea of South Korea, encompassing entire intertidal areas using long-term field survey combined with remote sensing technology. Twenty-one intertidal flats were targeted across seven provinces (Gyeonggi, Chungnam, Jeonbuk, Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, Gyeongbuk, Gangwon). Out of the evaluated environmental parameters, mud content represented a significant factor controlling sedimentary organic carbon stocks across target areas, and was significantly positively correlated to the total organic carbon (p < 0.05). Organic carbon stocks measured in salt marshes (i.e., upper intertidal zone) reflected the high carbon fixation capacity of halophytes through primary production. Sediment textural type was classified using analysis of remotely sensed imagery, and was closely correlated to field-based classification data (p < 0.05). Using field and remote sensing results, we estimated total organic carbon stocks (13,142,149 Mg C) and sequestration rates (71,383 Mg C yr(-1)) in the tidal flats of South Korea.

AB  - Herbaceous salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. Unfortunately, quantification of the above-ground portion of biomass using passive optical remote sensing is constrained by the complexities of mixed spectral appearance in the water land environment. Lidar remote sensing, on the other hand, has been extensively used to estimate forest biomass, and a few studies have reported their use in characterizing short or herbaceous plants. However, no empirical studies have demonstrated the combined use of lidar and spectral data to quantify above-ground biomass in herbaceous environments, including salt marshes. Thus, the findings of this study will contribute substantially to the understanding of potentials and limitations of using lidar and multi-spectral data for vegetation characterization and biomass estimates in salt marshes and other similar herbaceous environments. In this study, we evaluate the increased capability of a data fusion approach using small footprint discrete return lidar and multispectral data to quantify above-ground biomass and thus, carbon stocks in salt marshes. The specific objectives of our study were the following: 1) to understand the interaction between discrete-return airborne lidar and marsh vegetation; 2) to determine the appropriate grid size/s of lidar-derived datasets for characterizing marsh terrain and vegetation; 3) to investigate the applicability of a number of lidar metrics to predict salt marsh vegetation height and above-ground biomass; and 4) to evaluate the utility of integrating multispectral imagery with lidar to improve the predictability of regression models for quantifying above-ground biomass and carbon. Our results showed that salt marsh Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived using local minima in a grid spacing of 5 m x 5 m provided the best accuracy in terrain elevation estimates with an RMSE of less than 10 cm. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation heights (Lmax) provided the best agreement with field height measurements, but explained only 41% of the variance in vegetation height measurements (RMSE = 5.85 cm). Regardless of the metrics used, lidar-measured heights underestimated the field vegetation height, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in short or herbaceous vegetation. The fusion of lidar with multispectral data improved model predictions of live, dead, and total biomass quantities. The improvement provided by the fusion over the use of lidar or multispectral data alone was marginal; the combination explained 47% of the variance, whereas the best models using lidar and multispectral data separately explained 37% and 28% of variances in live biomass measurements, respectively. However, the best biomass prediction models reported considerably low RMSEs and % root square errors (%RSEs). For example, %RSE for the biomass prediction model using lidar-derived maximum vegetation height (Lmax) was closer to 20%, which is the recommended error threshold for remote sensing based forest biomass prediction models that can be repeatedly applicable for estimating forest carbon stock change. Our findings also demonstrate that lidar as compared to spectral data can provide better estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon, even in the herbaceous and low-relief context of a salt marsh.

AB  - Coastal seagrass, mangrove and salt-marsh ecosystems-also termed blue-carbon ecosystems-play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Much of the organic carbon they store rests in soils that have accumulated over thousands of years. Rapidly changing climate and environmental conditions, including sea-level rise, warming, eutrophication and landscape development, will impact decomposition and thus the global reservoir of blue soil organic carbon. Yet, it remains unclear how these disturbances will affect the key biogeochemical mechanisms controlling decomposition-mineral protection, redox zonation, water content and movement, and plant-microbe interactions. We assess the spatial and temporal scales over which decomposition mechanisms operate and how their effectiveness may change following disturbances. We suggest that better integration of decomposition mechanisms into blue-carbon models may improve predictions of soil organic carbon stores and facilitate incorporation of coastal vegetated ecosystems into global budgets and management tools.

AB  - Carbon (C) standing stocks, C mass balance, and soil C burial in tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) and TFFW transitioning to low-salinity marshes along the upper estuary are not typically included in blue carbon accounting, but may represent a significant C sink. Results from two salinity transects along the tidal Waccamaw and Savannah rivers of the U.S. Atlantic Coast show that total C standing stocks were 322-1,264Mg C/ha among all sites, generally shifting to greater soil storage as salinity increased. Carbon mass balance inputs (litterfall, woody growth, herbaceous growth, root growth, and surface accumulation) minus C outputs (surface litter and root decomposition, gaseous C) over a period of up to 11years were 340-900g Cm(-2)year(-1). Soil C burial was variable (7-337g Cm(-2)year(-1)), and lateral C export was estimated as C mass balance minus soil C burial as 267-849g Cm(-2)year(-1). This represents a large amount of C export to support aquatic biogeochemical transformations. Despite reduced C persistence within emergent vegetation, decomposition of organic matter, and higher lateral C export, total C storage increased as forests converted to marsh with salinization. These tidal river wetlands exhibited high N mineralization in salinity-stressed forested sites and considerable P mineralization in low-salinity marshes. Large C standing stocks and rates of C sequestration suggest that TFFW and oligohaline marshes are considerably important globally to coastal C dynamics and in facilitating energy transformations in areas of the world in which they occur.
   Plain Language Summary Tidal wetlands that occur along the upper reaches of river-associated estuaries are not normally considered when determining the amount of carbon stored, exchanged, or exported from terrestrial ecosystems globally. Examples of these wetland types include tidal freshwater forested wetlands and low-salinity marshes, as well as wetlands at different stages of transition between forest and marsh as salinity intrudes and sea levels rise. However, these tidal wetlands store more carbon than many coastal wetland types documented throughout the world, including classically defined blue carbon wetlands, and they support high rates of annual carbon sequestration (uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere) and lateral carbon export into aquatic environments that can influence critical near-shore and marine energy transformations.

AB  - To evaluate the potential of natural and modified salt-marsh soils to store organic carbon and their soil properties, we investigated six soil environments located at La Pletera salt-marsh area, NE Spain. Namely, Ruderal (RU), rubbles over marsh for construction purpose, ELY covered by Elymus elymoides (Raf.) meadows, ART under Arthrocnemurn fruticosum L., SAL under Salicornia patula Duval Jouve, AGR under Zea mays L., and AME under Medicago saliva L. as artificial meadow. Soils were sampled at three depths (0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm). At 0-5 cm depth, soil organic carbon (SOC) was higher in ART soil (40.08 g kg(-1)) with respect to ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg(-1) respectively). Glomalin (TGRSP) in ART had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg(-1) decreased by 51%, 77%, 89%, 92% and 94% in ELY, AME, AGR, SAL and RU soil respectively, indicating that in ART recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. ART and ELY soils had higher SOC and GRSP than AGR and AME soils at 0-5 and 5-20 cm (on average + 70% and 57%) but SOC values were similar at 20-40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in AGR and AME soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates (WSA) analysed in the 0.25-2 mm and 2-5.6 mm fractions was also higher in ART and ELY soils (approximate to 90%) at 0-5 and 5-20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher WSA (fraction 0.25-5 mm) was found in AGR and AME soils at 20-40 cm corroborating that at higher GRSP corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-CO2 (Mg ha(-1)) was evaluated at 0-5 cm depth and was much lower in ART soil. Accordingly, C-CO2/SOC ratio assigned to ART soil 1.85% of SOC loss against 8.26%, 11.64%, 18.90%, 20.37% and 22.72% of ELY, AME, RU, SAL and AGR soils respectively, indicating that only ART and ELY soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve (SAL) showed very low SOC (4.40 g kg(-1)) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-TGRSP resulted higher in ELY and ART soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha(-1)respectively) and C-TGRSP/SOC ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: ART > AME > ELY > AGR > SAL > RU, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to ART and ELY soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, RU, AGR and AME soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of ART and ELY soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.

AB  - Tidal flats form around the estuarine and coastal zone by continuous terrigenous sediment transport and deposition processes. Now a large body of published carbon research work frame within the vegetated area (mangrove forests, sea grass bed, and salt marshes). Nonvegetated tidal flats, which are characterized by predominantly silts and clays sediment, were generally impressed with low carbon stock due to their meager primary productivity. However, these regions may be a potentially important carbon sink, given their high burial rate, expanding areal coverage, and detrial organic carbon derived from watershed and adjacent vegetated area. Low carbon densities (<0.01 g cm(-3)) were found in Chinese tidal flat sediments by the study, but the carbon sequestration rates ranged from 35 to 361 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which were comparable to rates of worldwide vegetated coastal areas. The high rates can be ascribed to rapid sedimentation rates (1-2 cm yr(-1)) during the past several decades. The highest areal carbon stocks were located at tidal flat sites proximal to mangrove forests. The majority of carbon stocks (100 cm) was found in the unvegetated tidal flats instead of in the vegetated tidal flats. The former occupied 87% of the entire tidal area, 6.7 times larger than the latter. Tidal flats in coastal China store 78.07 Tg C (100 cm), accounting for nearly 80% of the C deposited in entire coastal tidal area. The future carbon sequestration rates of Chinese tidal flats are facing uncertainties under the pressures of reduced fluvial sediment loads from major rivers.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes store large amounts of carbon due to high rates of plant productivity and low organic matter decomposition rates in anoxic soils. As woody mangroves continue to encroach into herbaceous salt marshes, it is important to understand how these wetland biomes differ in soil microbial communities. Mangroves and marsh plants have different rooting structures and chemical qualities and could generate different environments for soil microbes, thus leading to changes in soil carbon processing. In an ecotonal ecosystem in Florida, where mangroves are rapidly encroaching into salt marshes, we compared wetland soil microbial community composition and function in mangrove-dominated vs. salt marsh-dominated plots. Microbial community structure differed between mangrove-dominant and marsh-dominant plots. The top indicator genera in the marsh-dominated plots belonged to putatively anaerobic groups (Tepidibacter, Caldithrix, Desulfovibro, Fibrobacteres, Thiotrichaceae) while top indicator genera in mangrove-dominated plots had representatives within Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Proteobacteria. In a substrate-induced respiration assay, samples from mangrove plots with the greatest root mass also had the highest rate of labile C substrate consumption. Our results suggest that mangroves and marsh plants have different sediment microbial communities and that future mangrove encroachment into salt marshes could alter soil microbial communities with potential implications for soil carbon storage.

AB  - Wetlands are important carbon sinks across the planet. However, soil carbon sequestration in tropical freshwater wetlands has been studied less than its counterpart in temperate wetlands. We compared carbon stocks and carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands with various geomorphic features (estuarine, perilacustrine and depressional) and various plant communities (marshes and swamps) on the tropical coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. These swamps are dominated by Ficus insipida, Pachira aquatic and Annona glabra and the marshes by Typha domingensis, Thalia geniculata, Cyperus giganteus, and Pontederia sagittata.
   The soil carbon concentration and bulk density were measured every 2 cm along 80 cm soil profiles in five swamps and five marshes. Short-term sediment accretion rates were measured during a year using horizontal makers in three of the five swamps and marshes, the carbon sequestration was calculated using the accretion rates, and the bulk density and the percentage of organic carbon in the surficial layer was measured.
   The average carbon concentration ranged from 50 to 150 gC kg(-1) in the marshes and 50 to 225 gC kg(-1) in the swamps. When the wetlands were grouped according to their geomorphic features, no significant differences in the carbon stock (P = 0.095) were found (estuarine (25.50 +/- 2.26 kgC m(-2)), perilacustrine (28.33 +/- 2.74 kgC m(-2)) and depressional wetlands (34.93 +/- 4.56 kgC m(-2))). However, the carbon stock was significantly higher (P = 0.030) in the swamps (34.96 +/- 1.3 kgC m(-2)) than in the marshes (25.85 +/- 1.19 kgC m(-2)). The average sediment accretion rates were 1.55 +/- 0.09 cm yr(-1) in the swamps and 0.84 +/- 0.02 cm yr(-1) in the marshes with significant differences (P = 0.040). The rate of carbon sequestration was higher (P = 0.001) in swamp soils (0.92 +/- 0.12 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) than marsh soils (0.31 +/- 0.08 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)). Differences in the rates of carbon sequestration associated with geomorphic features were found between the swamp ecosystems (P < 0.05); i.e., higher values were found in the swamps than in the marshes in perilacustrine and estuarine wetlands (P < 0.05). However, no significant differences (P = 0.324) in carbon sequestration rates were found between the marsh and swamp areas of the depressional site.
   Swamp soils are more important contributors to the carbon stock and sequestration than are marsh soils, resulting in a reduction in global warming, which suggests that the plant community is an important factor that needs to be considered in global carbon budgets and projects of restoration and conservation of wetlands.

AB  - Tidal marshes globally are experiencing erosion with sea level rise. In order to adaptively plan for essential marsh preservation, we recognize the importance of the investigation of marsh archives for the perspective they provide toward resilience. Our objective in this study is to examine the relationship of tidal marsh carbon sequestration with both climate change and human impact throughout past centuries and millennia. A Hudson River marsh sediment core spanning the last 2000 years is analyzed for bulk loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density, sedimentation rate, carbon (C) and mineral flux, and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis including lead, copper, titanium and potassium. We compare this record to previously established pollen and spore stratigraphy from the same site, along with an extensive macrofossil based AMS C-14 chronology based upon both cores. Carbon accumulation generally follows sediment accumulation rates, which were higher than 200 g C m(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1500 years ago. Declines in carbon storage rate during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) are linked to drought, fire, and charcoal, while lesser declines during the Little Ice Age (LIA) are linked to cooling and a shorter growing season. Subsequent human impact with marsh haying practices also led to carbon accumulation rate decline to 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Increases in C sequestration rates in recent decades may be attributable to nitrogen pollution of the estuary, invasive plants, and/or increased flooding, but the lack of mineral sediment threatens their stability. Ecosystem function is declining with the loss of foundational species, and the crisis is deepening for preservation of this habitat. We strongly recommend strategies for minimizing marsh loss.

AB  - Tidal marsh ecosystems are among earth's most efficient natural organic carbon (C) sinks and provide myriad ecosystem services. However, approximately half have been 'reclaimed' - i.e. converted to other land uses - potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by ltrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between similar to 2000 and similar to 5300 years older in reclaimed cores compared to intact marsh cores. We estimate a 70% loss of sediment C in reclaimed sites (equal to 73 Mg C ha(-1)), relative to stocks in intact tidal marshes during a comparable time period. Following reclamation, sediment C was characterized by coarse particulate organic matter with lower alkyl-o-alkyl ratios and higher amounts of aromatic C, suggesting a lower extent of decomposition and therefore lower likelihood of being incorporated into long-term C stocks compared to that of intact tidal marshes. We conclude that reclamation of tidal marshes can diminish C stocks that have accumulated over millennial time scales, and these losses may go undetected if additional analyses are not employed in conjunction with C stock estimates.

AB  - Salt marshes provide various ecosystem functions and services including flooding protection, wildlife habitats, and carbon storage. These functions and services could, however, be strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities such as livestock grazing - a common practice in the Wadden Sea salt marshes located in North west of Europe. To assess the impact of grazing on soil parameters, a total number of eight soil cores (circle divide: 18 cm; L: 50 cm) were collected in areas with and without livestock grazing, and scanned using a Computed Tomography (CT) to characterize soil parameters including soil macroporosity, sediment density, and pores connectivity. Subsequently, sub-samples were taken for determination of soil moisture content (%) and bulk density (g cm(-3)). To account for the impact of grazing on soil drainage after tidal inundations, water table relative to soil surface was monitored during two flooding events. Our results demonstrated that grazed salt marsh has higher top-soil bulk density, and lower macroporosity and pore connectivity, than ungrazed marsh, due to soil compaction by livestock grazing. Moreover, grazed marsh has slower water drainage and that might keep the soil waterlogged for a longer period of time which has implications on lowering decomposition rate due to lower soil redox. This study provides evidence that grazing alters physical soil parameters in salt marsh. Consequently, grazing needs to be accounted for when evaluating how land use impacts ecosystem services and functions including carbon sequestration.

AB  - [1] Wetlands represent the largest component of the terrestrial biological carbon pool and thus play an important role in global carbon cycles. Most global carbon budgets, however, have focused on dry land ecosystems that extend over large areas and have not accounted for the many small, scattered carbon-storing ecosystems such as tidal saline wetlands. We compiled data for 154 sites in mangroves and salt marshes from the western and eastern Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico. The set of sites spans a latitudinal range from 22.4degreesS in the Indian Ocean to 55.5degrees N in the northeastern Atlantic. The average soil carbon density of mangrove swamps (0.055 +/- 0.004 g cm(-3)) is significantly higher than the salt marsh average (0.039 +/- 0.003 g cm(-3)). Soil carbon density in mangrove swamps and Spartina patens marshes declines with increasing average annual temperature, probably due to increased decay rates at higher temperatures. In contrast, carbon sequestration rates were not significantly different between mangrove swamps and salt marshes. Variability in sediment accumulation rates within marshes is a major control of carbon sequestration rates masking any relationship with climatic parameters. Globally, these combined wetlands store at least 44.6 Tg C yr(-1) and probably more, as detailed areal inventories are not available for salt marshes in China and South America. Much attention has been given to the role of freshwater wetlands, particularly northern peatlands, as carbon sinks. In contrast to peatlands, salt marshes and mangroves release negligible amounts of greenhouse gases and store more carbon per unit area.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

AB  - Forested wetlands play a vital role in the coastal zone, but their vulnerability to coastal change-and the impact to high-value ecosystem services-is not as well established as that of more seaward systems such as saltmarsh and mangroves. To address this need, we develop field-based stand density classes, then classify baldcypress-water tupelo (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich var. distichurm Nyssa aquatica L) stand density on the Mississippi River delta using a multitemporal ordination of reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Approximately 29, 50, and 21% of forest was classified as full canopy, intermediate, and open canopy, respectively. We estimate stand-level live-stem carbon stocks and annual accumulation rates of 96, 67, and 39 t-C ha(-1) and 1.9, 1.4 and 0.8 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1) for full-canopy, intermediate, and open-canopy forest, respectively. Regional live-stem carbon stocks are similar to 69 t-C ha(-1), and total carbon and annual increment for all forest analyzed are similar to 17 Mt-C and similar to 0.34 Mt-C yr-1. Much of the cypress-tupelo forest on the delta stores carbon at rates significantly below the potential of fully stocked stands, yet overall rates of accumulation are comparable to other forest types and coastal systems. Delta-wide, there is a well-defined coastward gradient of stand density, which has important implications for the future of deltaic forests and their ecosystem services. The similarities between forest density gradients and well-documented marsh loss patterns in the region suggest that the same processes driving coastal marsh loss-relative sea level rise exacerbated by human activity-are likely responsible for a second, more gradual interface of land loss at the marsh-forest boundary. Results highlight the potential response of coastal forests to continued environmental change-and associated impacts to the carbon cycle-and provide a baseline for detecting future change to forests on the Mississippi River delta.

AB  - Combined effects of vegetation, tide and sediment on the carbon dynamics in the intertidal creek-marsh systems remain unclear. We investigated the variability of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC), and particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (PIC) in the tidal creeks within the Poaceae and Cyperaceae communities on flood-ebb cycle in a salt marsh of eastern China. In the Poaceae creek with high plant biomass and soil carbon stock, the DOC concentrations were higher by on average 1.00-1.48 times than that in the Cyperaceae creek across all seasons and spring and neap tide stages, while the difference of DIC was not notable. The POC and PIC concentrations were lower in the Poaceae creek compared to the Cyperaceae creek. Spring tides increased the carbon concentrations (except for PIC) in both creeks by on average 7-40%, relative to neap tides. Seasonal variations of sedimentary rate within the communities probably result in the discrepancy of particulate carbon loading between the creeks. The Poaceae creek functioned as a source of DOC and DIC throughout a year but as a sink of POC and PIC in summer and autumn, while it turned to a weak source of PIC in winter and spring. The Cyperaceae creek exhibited as a source of all carbon components throughout a year. We suggest that vegetation type (with soil carbon stocks), tidal regimes and sedimentary dynamics would synergistically determine the fate of carbon in the creeks. Our results are helpful in reliable estimates of carbon transport between the coastal marsh and the adjacent ocean.

AB  - Salt marshes provide the important ecosystem service of carbon storage in their sediments; however, little is known about the sources of such carbon and whether they differ between historically unaltered and restoring systems. In this study, stable isotope analysis was used to quantify carbon sources in a restoring, sparsely vegetated marsh (Restoring) and an adjacent, historically unaltered marsh (Reference) in the Nisqually River Delta (NRD) of Washington, USA. Three sediment cores were collected at "Inland" and "Seaward" locations at both marshes similar to 6 years after restoration. Benthic diatoms, C3 plants, C4 plants, and particulate organic matter (POM) were collected throughout the NRD. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of sources and sediments were used in a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to determine the contribution of each carbon source to the sediments of both marshes. Autochthonous marsh C3 plants contributed 73 +/- 10% (98 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and 89 +/- 11% (119 g C m(-2) year(-1)) to Reference-Inland and Reference-Seaward sediment carbon sinks, respectively. In contrast, the sediment carbon sink at the Restoring Marsh received a broad assortment of predominantly allochthonous materials, which varied in relative contribution based on source distance and abundance. Marsh POM contributed the most to Restoring-Seaward (42 +/- 34%) (69 g C m(-2) year(-1)) followed by Riverine POM at Restoring-Inland (32 +/- 41%) (52 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Overall, this study demonstrates that largely unvegetated, restoring marshes can accumulate carbon by relying predominantly on allochthonous material, which comes mainly from the most abundant and closest estuarine sources.

AB  - Decomposition of plant litter in salt marshes plays an important role in coastal trophodynamics, nutrient cycling, sediment trapping, and short-term carbon storage, all of which are likely to be affected by climate change and accelerated sea-level rise. Warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, longer and more frequent inundation, and saltwater intrusion will all interact to affect decomposition of plant litter in a complex way. A combination of field experiments and model selection techniques was applied to study how these environmental factors affected litter decomposition of two dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, along the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results from summer field experiments conducted between June and August of 2013 showed that S. alterniflora in the low marsh had higher litter losses (0.286 +/- 0.0883 g d(-1), mean standard deviation) and decomposition coefficients (0.0115 +/- 0.00416 d(-1)) than J. roemerianus in the midmarsh locations (0.0963 +/- 0.0480 g 0.00416 +/- 0.00223 d(-1)). Modeling results showed that the interaction between temperature and salinity significantly affected decomposition coefficients of both species positively during this experiment. This study suggests that accelerated leaf litter decomposition due to rising temperature and increased salinity will occur under climate change and sea-level rise, and this will potentially lead to important ecological consequences for salt marshes.

AB  - The high carbon (C) sequestration potentials of coastal wetlands play an important role in mitigating climate change associated with the greenhouse effect. In the present study, soil samples were collected from the 0-30-cm topsoil layers and from 0 to 100-cm cores for the analysis of the spatial dynamics and vertical distribution of organic carbon (OC) and biomass in different vegetation zones in a small tidal basin in Chongming Dongtan wetland. According to the results, sediments in the region were a mixture of terrestrial and marine sources and the proportions of terrestrial components decreased with an increase in depth. In addition, soil properties were quite similar in the top-soil layer. In the study area, the OC concentration was in the 0.7-10.93 g/kg range, which was positively correlated with halophyte biomass and negatively correlated with soil salinity and particle size. Furthermore, OC content decreased with an increase in depth. The OC content in different halophyte communities was in the order of Phragmites australis community > Mixed community > sedge community, and was consistent with the gross biomass. The total C sequestered of 100-cm depth in the area was 31,177 ton, with the P. australis community, mixed community, sedge community, and water sequestering 57.7, 49.2, 25.5 t/ha, and 8 t/tidal cycle, respectively. Tidal marshes in Chongming Dongtan exhibited a high C sequestration capacity, indicating that they play a major role in the C cycle in the Yangtze Estuary.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes, as "blue carbon" ecosystems, play a critical role in mitigation of global climate change since their large soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Drying-rewetting cycles induced by periodic tides have profound influence on soil carbon cycling in tidal salt marshes. However, the magnitude and mechaanism of the effects of drying-rewetting frequency on SOC loss in tidal salt marshes is still uncertain. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to identify how drying-rewetting frequency changes alter the vertical (CO2 and CH4) and lateral (dissolved organic carbon) carbon losses of soils in a tidal salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We found that increasing soil moisture inhibited CO2 emission but stimulated CH4 emission in a tidal salt marsh. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was produced in the drying phase and rewetting lead to the loss of DOC. Soil moisture and salinity change induced by drying-rewetting cycles were the critical factors controlling vertical organic carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh. DOC had significant effects on CO2 emissions. Changes of tidal action and drying-rewetting cycle induced by global change can affect the pathway of carbon loss in a tidal salt marsh.

AB  - Tidal marshes are sedimentary environments and are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. As a consequence they have the potential to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by sequestering organic carbon (OC). In the past decades, most research on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in marsh environments has focused on salt marshes, leaving carbon dynamics in brackish and freshwater marshes largely understudied and neglecting the diversity among tidal marshes. We therefore conducted an extensive sampling campaign to quantify and characterize SOC stock in marshes along a salinity gradient in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands). We find that SOC stocks vary significantly along the estuary, from 46 in freshwater marshes to 10 kg OC m(-2) in salt marshes. Our data also show that most existing studies underestimate total SOC stocks due to shallow soil sampling, which also influences reported patterns in OC storage along estuaries. In all sampled tidal marsh sediments the SOC concentration is more or less constant from a certain depth downward. However, this concentration decreases with increasing salinity, indicating that the amount of stable SOC decreases from the upper estuary towards the coast. Although the net primary production of macrophytes differs along the estuary, our data suggest that the differences in OC storage are caused mainly by variations in suspended sediment concentration and stable particulate OC (POC) content in the water along the estuary. The fraction of terrestrial suspended sediments and POC that is transported downstream of the maximum turbidity zone is very limited, contributing to smaller amounts of long-term OC sequestration in brackish and salt marsh sediments. In addition, high rates of sediment deposition on freshwater tidal marshes in the maximum turbidity zone promote efficient burial of OC in these marsh sediments.

AB  - The ability of marshes and forested wetlands to provide environmental services (water retention in soil and carbon storage) was evaluated at three locations along the coast of Veracruz, Mexico. Hydro-periods were obtained for the different vegetation communities of marshes and forested wetlands. Total organic carbon contents were 26.2% in Pachira swamp, 23.1% in Ficus swamp and 11.2% in marsh soils. The largest values of hydraulically active pore space were observed for marshes (0.79 cm(3) cm(-3)), and the lowest in forested wetlands (0.57 cm(3) cm(-3)). Soil water holding capacity ranged from 556 to 834 L m(-2) for swamp areas and from 687 to 880 L m(-2) for marshes. The thickness of soil organic layers in the wetland studied had a major control on soil water storage. This suggests that a vast amount of rain water could be retained in the soil. The results indicate that both swamps and marshes play important roles in their capacities to retain water and sequester carbon, although there were no significant differences among them.

AB  - Over the last two decades, grazing intensity has increased in the temperate salt marshes of Samborombon Bay (Argentina) due to agricultural expansion and the displacement of domestic livestock to these areas. We investigated the effect of cattle grazing on soil chemical and physical properties in the higher (HE), medium (ME) and lower (LE) elevation levels of this temperate salt marsh. Soil data were collected from both a National Park, where cattle grazing has been excluded for more than 35yrs, and an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously grazed by cattle. We found that soil salinity was greater on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, especially those in the ME and LE. This could be related to the upward flow of salts from the saline groundwater, driven by the increase in the proportion of bare soil on grazed sites. The increase in soil salinity changed the plant community structure through the increase of salt-tolerant and non-palatable species and the decrease of palatable species. Soil physical variables (soil bulk density and soil bearing capacity) were also higher on the grazed than on the ungrazed sites, which can be related to the decrease in soil organic matter (SOM), and suggest an incipient compaction process; however, the values were still lower than those considered critical for plant growth in clay soils. These results suggest that continuous grazing management in this temperate salt marsh might have negative consequences for animal production and ecosystem conservation, mainly related to the increased soil salinity. Further research will be necessary to evaluate the suitability of switching to intermittent grazing management.

AB  - The sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and ocean into coastal ecosystems such as seaweed beds, seagrasses, saltmarshes, and tidal flats is an important and emerging area of interest due to their valuable role in carbon storage and potential for moderating climate conditions. Here, we investigated how these ecosystems in Korea can serve as carbon sinks and estimated the amount of CO2 that might be removed through aquaculture beds, artificial reefs, and sea forests. We also examined the benefits of restoring degraded coastal ecosystems. In total, we estimated that the 0.38 x 10(6) ha covered by Korean coastal ecosystems could potentially lock up approximately 1.01 x 10(6) t of CO2.

AB  - Salt marsh survival with sea-level rise (SLR) increasingly relies on soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and preservation. Using a novel combination of geochemical approaches, we characterized fine SOC (<= 1 mm) supporting marsh elevation maintenance. Overlaying thermal reactivity, source (delta C-13), and age ((FC)-C-14) information demonstrates several processes contributing to soil development: marsh grass production, redeposition of eroded material, and microbial reworking. Redeposition of old carbon, likely from creekbanks, represented similar to 9%-17% of shallow SOC (<= 26 cm). Soils stored marsh grass-derived compounds with a range of reactivities that were reworked over centuries-to-millennia. Decomposition decreases SOC thermal reactivity throughout the soil column while the decades-long disturbance of ponding accelerated this shift in surface horizons. Empirically derived estimates of SOC turnover based on geochemical composition spanned a wide range (640-9,951 years) and have the potential to inform predictions of marsh ecosystem evolution.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marsh survival with rising sea levels increasingly depends on the accumulation and preservation of buried organic carbon. Marsh soil organic carbon development reflects at least three processes: burial of differently reactive compounds that derive from local grasses, redeposition of old carbon (9%-17%), and microbial reworking. Decomposition results in a progressive decrease in the thermal reactivity of soil organic carbon, and disturbances such as ponding can accelerate this shift. Modeled rates of geochemically defined soil organic carbon pools turnover on the order of centuries-to-millennia and can refine predictions of salt marsh sustainability.

AB  - Blue carbon - the carbon stored and sequestered in mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal salt marshes is considered a cost-effective means to achieve positive climate change mitigation and adaptation outcomes. Blue carbon is therefore of considerable interest to the scientific and policy communities, and is frequently discussed in relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper identifies peer-reviewed and 'gray literature' documents that discuss blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue carbon literature is dominated by technical and policy commentary, with a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the nature and role of important concepts including private and public sector finance and instruments; and (3) understanding of the important issues of investment priorities and risk considerations is also limited. This paper therefore identifies gaps in the blue carbon literature, clarifies critical concepts and issues, and proposes novel pathways for blue carbon research and project development (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is increasing urgency to implement climate change mitigation strategies that enhance greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Recently, coastal "blue carbon" habitats-mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows-have received attention for their ability to capture CO2 and store organic carbon (OC), primarily in their sediments. Across habitat types and regions, however, information about the sequestration rates and sources of carbon to local sediments remains sparse. Here we compiled recently obtained estimates of sediment OC stocks and sequestration rates from 139 cores collected from temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Across all cores sediment OC content averaged 0.75%. Organic carbon stocks in the top 25 cm and 1 m of the sediment averaged 1,846 and 7,168 g OC m(-2), respectively. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 4.6 to 93.0 g OCm-2 y(r-1) and averaged 24.8 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic data from this region suggest that OC in the sediments is largely from noneelgrass sources. In general, these values are comparable to those from other temperate Z. marina meadows, but significantly lower than previously reported values for seagrasses globally. These results further highlight the need for local and species-level quantification of blue carbon parameters. While temperate eelgrass meadows may not sequester and store as much carbon as seagrass meadows elsewhere, climate policy incentives should still be implemented to protect existing sediment carbon stocks and the other critical ecosystem services associated with eelgrass habitats.

AB  - Emergent herbaceous wetlands are characterized by complex salt marsh ecosystems that play a key role in diverse coastal processes including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, flood attenuation and shoreline protection. Surface elevation characterization and spatiotemporal distribution of these ecosystems are commonly obtained from LiDAR measurements as this low-cost airborne technique has a wide range of applicability and usefulness in coastal environments. LiDAR techniques, despite significant advantages, show poor performance in generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) in tidal salt marshes due to large vertical errors. In this study, we present a methodology to (i) update emergent herbaceous wetlands (i.e., the ones delineated in the 2016 National Land Cover Database) to present-day conditions; and (ii) automate salt marsh elevation correction in estuarine systems. We integrate object-based image analysis and random forest technique with surface reflectance Landsat imagery to map three emergent U.S. wetlands in Weeks Bay, Alabama, Savannah Estuary, Georgia and Fire Island, New York. Conducting a hyperparameter tuning of random forest and following a hierarchical approach with three nomenclature levels for land cover classification, we are able to better map wetlands and improve overall accuracies in Weeks Bay (0.91), Savannah Estuary (0.97) and Fire Island (0.95). We then develop a tool in ArcGIS to automate salt marsh elevation correction. We use this 'DEM-correction' tool to modify an existing DEM (model input) with the calculated elevation correction over salt marsh regions. Our method and tool are validated with real-time kinematic elevation data and helps correct overestimated salt marsh elevation up to 0.50 m in the studied estuaries. The proposed tool can be easily adapted to different vegetation species in wetlands, and thus help provide accurate DEMs for flood inundation mapping in estuarine systems.

AB  - High rates of carbon burial observed in wetland sediments have garnered attention as a potential "natural fix" to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere. A carbon accumulation rate (CAR) can be determined through various methods that integrate a carbon stock over different time periods, ranging from decades to millennia. Our goal was to assess how CAR changed over the lifespan of a salt marsh. We applied a geochronology to a series of salt marsh cores using both C-14 and Pb-210 markers to calculate CARs that were integrated between 35 and 2,460 years before present. CAR was 39 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) when integrated over millennia but was upward of 148 g C center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) for the past century. We present additional evidence to account for this variability by linking it to changes in relative sea level rise (RSLR), where higher rates of RSLR were associated with higher CARs. Thus, the CAR calculated for a wetland should integrate timescales that capture the influence of contemporary RSLR. Therefore, caution should be exercised not to utilize a CAR calculated over inappropriately short or long timescales as a current assessment or forecasting tool for the climate change mitigation potential of a wetland.

AB  - Hydrology drives the carbon balance of wetlands by controlling the uptake and release of CO2 and CH4. Longer dry periods in between heavier precipitation events predicted for the Everglades region, may alter the stability of large carbon pools in this wetland's ecosystems. To determine the effects of drought on CO2 fluxes and CH4 emissions, we simulated changes in hydroperiod with three scenarios that differed in the onset rate of drought (gradual, intermediate, and rapid transition into drought) on 18 freshwater wetland monoliths collected from an Everglades short-hydroperiod marsh. Simulated drought, regardless of the onset rate, resulted in higher net CO2 losses net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over the 22-week manipulation. Drought caused extensive vegetation dieback, increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and reduced carbon uptake gross ecosystem exchange (GEE). Photosynthetic potential measured by reflective indices (photochemical reflectance index, water index, normalized phaeophytinization index, and the normalized difference vegetation index) indicated that water stress limited GEE and inhibited R-eco. As a result of drought-induced dieback, NEE did not offset methane production during periods of inundation. The average ratio of net CH4 to NEE over the study period was 0.06, surpassing the 100-year greenhouse warming compensation point for CH4 (0.04). Drought-induced diebacks of sawgrass (C-3) led to the establishment of the invasive species torpedograss (C-4) when water was resupplied. These changes in the structure and function indicate that freshwater marsh ecosystems can become a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, even following an extended drought. Future changes in precipitation patterns and drought occurrence/duration can change the carbon storage capacity of freshwater marshes from sinks to sources of carbon to the atmosphere. Therefore, climate change will impact the carbon storage capacity of freshwater marshes by influencing water availability and the potential for positive feedbacks on radiative forcing.

AB  - Latitudinal gradients in ecosystem patterns arise from complex interactions between biotic and abiotic forces operating at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Widespread invasive species, particularly invasive ecosystem engineers with large effects on their environment, may alter these gradients. We sampled 3-5 stands of the invasive common reed, Phragmites australis, in eight coastal wetlands ranging from Massachusetts (42 degrees N) to South Carolina (32 degrees N) to document geographic variation in P. australis primary production, associated plant and animal species diversity, and sediment carbon storage and to examine how local-, regional-, and large-scale environmental factors contribute to these patterns. Latitude best explained variation in P. australis density, but contrary to expectations, density increased with increasing latitude across our sites. Latitude also predicted macroinvertebrate species richness, which increased with latitude in a manner similar to P. australis density. In addition to latitude, P. australis leaf carbon:nitrogen ratios, distance to the open coast, and sediment oxygen levels were most important for explaining variation in P. australis production, as well as community (plant or animal species richness) and ecosystem (carbon storage) variables. The percent of developed land was positively associated with P. australis density, yet this variable had relatively low predictive power in our study. Our study provides an important biogeographic perspective for documenting and understanding variation in invasive P. australis that is fundamental both for managing the invasion and for understanding latitudinal gradients in ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Salt marshes are vulnerable ecosystems since they are found in locations often preferred for urban development. They produce a great amount of biomass, and also are of great interest because of the ecosystem services they provide from which carbon storage stands out. This work aims to study the energy and mass exchanged by a salt marsh located in southeastern Buenos Aires province (Argentina) and to characterize its net ecosystem production. A field campaign was carried out from February 2014 to March 2015. Sensible heat, water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured with eddy covariance technique at 6 m height over a Spartina densiflora canopy. Fifty five percent of the data were lost and 15% more were discarded due to low turbulence conditions. This gaps were filled with a combination of techniques (look-up tables and mean diurnal variations), which allowed the estimation of monthly mean net ecosystem exchange, gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. As in other marshes, the latent heat flux consumed more than 55% of the available energy of the system, reaching up to 85% after a large flood event. This flux systematically exceeds the values of sensible heat measured throughout the study period. Unlike other environments, this southern salt marsh behaved as a CO2 sink throughout the year. The net ecosystem production from March 2014 to February 2015 was approximately -10.5 t of CO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) which is greater than reported results for other wetlands. These preliminary results for a southern S. densiflora salt marsh are encouraging, although new field studies are under way to confirm their accuracy.

AB  - Coastal marshes are important carbon sinks facing serious threats from climatic stressors. Current research reveals that the growth of individual marsh plants is susceptible to a changing climate, but the responses of different marsh systems at a landscape scale are less clear. Here, we document the multi-decadal changes in the phenology and the area of the extensive coastal marshes in Louisiana, USA, a representative of coastal ecosystems around the world that currently experiencing sea-level rise, temperature warming, and atmospheric CO2 increase. The phenological records are constructed using the longest continuous satellite-based record of the Earth's ecosystems, the Landsat data, and an advanced modeling technique, the nonlinear mixed model. We find that the length of the growing seasons of the intermediate and brackish marshes increased concomitantly with the atmospheric CO2 concentration over the last 30 years, and predict that such changes will continue and accelerate in the future. These phenological changes suggest a potential increase in CO2 uptake and thus a negative feedback mechanism to climate change. The areas of the freshwater and intermediate marshes were stable over the period studied, but the areas of the brackish and saline marshes decreased substantially, suggesting ecosystem instability and carbon storage loss under the anticipated sea-level rise. The marshes' phenological shifts portend their potentially critical role in climate mitigation, and the different responses among systems shed light on the underlying mechanisms of such changes.

AB  - Water and salinity regulation measures have been widely taken to restore the ecological structures and functions of degraded coastal wetlands. To investigate the effects of different water and salinity regulation measures on soil carbon stocks in coastal wetlands, soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in four types of wetlands (i.e., restored tidal salt marshes (RTSM, covered with Suaeda salsa) and degraded tidal salt marshes (DTSM, bare land); freshwater restored wetlands (FRW) and degraded wetlands without freshwater inputs (DWFI), covered with Phragmites australis) during the period from August to October in 2015 in the Yellow River Delta, China. Our results showed that the mean values of total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were higher in restored wetlands (e.g., RTSM and FRW) than those in degraded wetlands (e.g., DTSM and DWFI). Along the whole soil profile, TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC were higher in RTSM soils than those in DTSM soils except for TC and SOC in the 0-10 cm soils and DOC in the 40-50 cm soils. FRW soils contained higher TC, SOC, ROOC and DOC than DWFI except for DOC in the 0-10 cm soils. Soil TC density (TCD), SOC density (SOCD), ROOC density (ROOCD) and DOC density (DOCD) in the top 50 cm soils in restored wetlands were higher compared with degraded wetlands. Multivariate analysis showed that soil carbon was significantly influenced by EC, soil base cations and anions (e.g., K+, Ca2+ Cl- and SO42-), pH, TN, C/N ratio, bulk density (BD) and soil texture (p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that these two water and salinity regulation measures are effective in increasing soil carbon stocks of coastal wetlands.

AB  - Marine climate change mitigation initiatives have recently attracted a great deal of interest in the role of natural carbon sinks, particularly on coastal systems. Brown seaweeds of the genus Sargassum are the largest canopyforming algae in tropical and subtropical environments, with a wide global distribution on rocky reefs and as floating stands. Because these algae present high amounts of biomass, we suggest their contribution is relevant for global carbon stocks and consequently formitigating climate change as CO2 remover. Wemodelled global distributions and quantified carbon stocks as above-ground biomass (AGB) with machine learning algorithms and climate data. Sargassum AGB totaled 13.1 Pg C at the global scale, which is a significant amount of carbon, comparable to other key marine ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows. However, specific techniques related to bloom production and management, or the utilization of biomass for biomaterials, should be fostered. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global recognition of climate change and its predicted consequences has created the need for practical management strategies for increasing the ability of natural ecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon. Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta-analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7-17 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration). Our meta-analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high-risk areas.

AB  - Salt marsh and mangrove have been recognized as being among the most valuable ecosystem types globally in terms of their supply of ecosystem services and support for human livelihoods. These coastal ecosystems are also susceptible to the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, with evidence of global shifts in the distribution of mangroves, including encroachment into salt marshes. The encroachment of woody mangrove shrubs and trees into herbaceous salt marshes may represent a substantial change in ecosystem structure, although resulting impacts on ecosystem functions and service provisions are largely unknown. In this review, we assess changes in ecosystem services associated with mangrove encroachment. While there is quantitative evidence to suggest that mangrove encroachment may enhance carbon storage and the capacity of a wetland to increase surface elevation in response to sea-level rise, for most services there has been no direct assessment of encroachment impact. On the basis of current understanding of ecosystem structure and function, we theorize that mangrove encroachment may increase nutrient storage and improve storm protection, but cause declines in habitat availability for fauna requiring open vegetation structure (such as migratory birds and foraging bats) as well as the recreational and cultural activities associated with this fauna (e.g., bird-watching and/or hunting). Changes to provisional services such as fisheries productivity and cultural services are likely to be site specific and dependent on the species involved. We discuss the need for explicit experimental testing of the effects of encroachment on ecosystem services in order to address key knowledge gaps, and present an overview of the options available to coastal resource managers during a time of environmental change.

AB  - The relationship of the organic carbon content and surface sediment composition to the litter mass of Spartina alterniflora was analyzed to investigate the responses of organic carbon content and composition to biomass changes in a salt marsh after the introduction of S. alterniflora. The vertical distribution of sediment organic carbon and its relationship with S. alterniflora underground biomass was also examined. The results show that the total organic carbon (TOC), recalcitrant carbon (RC) and labile carbon (LC) contents were significantly greater in the surface sediments of the S. alterniflora flat, which showed different intra-annual variation trends compared to a bare flat. In particular, the majority of S. alterniflora-derived organic carbon was LC in the S. alterniflora flat sediments, indicating that the introduction of S. alterniflora resulted in a significant increase in surface sediment LC content. In addition, the results of S. alterniflora litter decomposition revealed a rapid decrease of 40% in the organic carbon stocks within the first 2 months, and the TOC and LC contents showed intra-annual variation trends similar to the surface litter mass but with a two-month "phase difference" in time. Further analysis indicated, S. alterniflora litter controlled the content and proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived TOC input, and it ultimately affected the TOC content variations in the sediments. However, due to the LC mainly originated from S. alterniflora, the surface litter exerted more significant impact on the variation of LC content. In the bare flat core, the relatively low TOC, RC and LC content values were significantly influenced by the grain control effect, and the origins of these components were mainly derived from non-S. alterniflora sources. However, in the S. alterniflora flat cores, the relationships between organic carbon content, grain size and underground biomass, together with the analysis of the organic carbon origins, indicated that the S. alterniflora underground biomass significantly affected the origin of organic carbon. In addition, Spartina alterniflora introduction significantly increased the carbon sequestration capacity of the tidal salt marsh in North Jiangsu. Furthermore, the TOC, LC and RC accumulation rate analyses also indicated that S. alterniflora introduction improved the salt marsh soil and was beneficial to long-term carbon sequestration of the organic carbon pool.

AB  - Herbaceous marsh is the most widely distributed type of marsh wetland ecosystem, and has important ecological functions such as water conservation, climate regulation, carbon storage and fixation, and sheltering rare species. The carbon sequestration function of herbaceous marsh plays a key role in slowing climate warming and maintaining regional environmental stability. Vegetation biomass is an important index reflecting the carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands. Investigating the biomass of marsh vegetation can provide a scientific basis for estimating the carbon storage and carbon sequestration capacity of marshes. Based on field survey data of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation and the distribution data set of marsh in China, we analyzed the aboveground biomass and its spatial distribution pattern of herbaceous marsh on a national scale for the first time. The results showed that in China the total area of herbaceous marsh was 9.7x10(4) km(2), the average density of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation was 227.5 +/- 23.0 g C m(-2) (95% confidence interval, the same below), and the total aboveground biomass was 22.2 +/- 2.2 Tg C (1 Tg=10(12) g). The aboveground biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation is generally low in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, and high in central North China and coastal regions in China. In different marsh distribution regions of China, the average biomass density of herbaceous marsh vegetation from small to large was as follows: temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (182.3 +/- 49.3 g C m(-2))<Tibetan Plateau marsh region (243.9 +/- 26.6 g C m(-2))<temperate arid and semi-arid marsh region (300.5 +/- 73.2 g C m(-2))<subtropical humid marsh region (348.4 +/- 59.0 g C m(-2))<coastal marsh region (675.4 +/- 73.8 g C m(-2)). Due to the different area of herbaceous marsh, the total above-ground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in different marsh distribution regions was the largest in the temperate humid and semi-humid marsh region (9.6 +/- 2.6 Tg C), and was the smallest in the coastal marsh region (1.1 +/- 0.1 Tg C). The spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in China has obvious non-zonality characteristics, but also presents certain zonality in some regions. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in the Tibetan Plateau decreased with the increase of altitude. With the aggravation of drought, the aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions and temperate arid and semi-arid regions decreased first and then did not obviously change. The aboveground biomass of herbaceous marsh vegetation in temperate humid and semi-humid regions was relatively larger in the regions with higher average annual temperature. The results can provide scientific basis for accurately evaluating the adjustment action of wetland ecosystems on climate, and provide decision support for adaptive management of wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are important ecosystems for carbon storage and coastal resilience to climate change and sea-level rise. As such, changes in wetland habitat types can also impact ecosystem functions. Our goal was to quantify historical vegetation change within the Nisqually River watershed relevant to carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and wetland sustainability, and identify watershed-scale anthropogenic and hydrodynamic drivers of these changes. To achieve this, we produced time-series classifications of habitat, photosynthetic pathway functional types and species in the Nisqually River Delta for the years 1957, 1980, and 2015. Using an object-oriented approach, we performed a hierarchical classification on historical and current imagery to identify change within the watershed and wetland ecosystems. We found a 188.4 ha (79%) increase in emergent marsh wetland within the Nisqually River Delta between 1957 and 2015 as a result of restoration efforts that occurred in several phases through 2009. Despite these wetland gains, a total of 83.1 ha (35%) of marsh was lost between 1957 and 2015, particularly in areas near the Nisqually River mouth due to erosion and shifting river channels, resulting in a net wetland gain of 105.4 ha (44%). We found the trajectory of wetland recovery coincided with previous studies, demonstrating the role of remote sensing for historical wetland change detection as well as future coastal wetland monitoring.

AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation.

AB  - Reducing uncertainty in data inputs at relevant spatial scales can improve tidal marsh forecasting models, and their usefulness in coastal climate change adaptation decisions. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially. Improving information for coastal modeling will support planning for ecosystem services, including habitat, carbon storage, and flood protection.

AB  - Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.

AB  - This study was conducted in the coastal zone located in Caciliengroden, Jadebusen Bay (North Germany). The aim was to examine the changes in organic matter properties along a salt marsh soil chronosequence. Three soil profiles were located in low, middle-high and high marsh zones, between the mud flat tidal area and the dike. We propose a pattern of spatial changes in properties of salt marsh soils along the studied chronosequence.
   The results lead to the conclusion that some organic matter properties (C: N, humic to fulvic acid ratios and aromaticity of the humic acids) are good indicators for the extent of development of the studied soils. The lowest values of those indices, typical for aquatic sediments, were related to the initial soils (low marsh) while the highest values were recorded for semi-mature soils (high marsh).

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) thrives across the estuarine salinity gradient providing valuable ecosystem services. Within the saline portion of estuaries, seagrass areas are frequently cited as hotspots for their role in capturing and retaining organic carbon (C-org). Non-seagrass SAV, located in the fresh to brackish estuarine areas, may also retain significant soil C-org, yet their role remains unquantified. Given rapidly occurring landscape and salinity changes due to human and natural disturbances, landscape level carbon pool estimates from estuarine SAV habitat blue carbon estimates are needed. We assessed C-org stocks in SAV habitat soils from estuarine freshwater to saline habitats (interior deltaic) to saline barrier islands (Chandeleur Island) within the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), Louisiana, USA. SAV habitats contain C-org stocks equivalent to those reported for other estuarine vegetation types (seagrass, salt marsh, mangrove). Interior deltaic SAV C-org stocks (231.6 +/- 19.5 Mg C-org ha(-1)) were similar across the salinity gradient, and significantly higher than at barrier island sites (56.6 +/- 10.4 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Within the MRDP, shallow water SAV habitat covers up to an estimated 28,000 ha, indicating that soil C-org storage is potentially 6.4 +/- 0.1 Tg representing an unaccounted C-org pool. Extrapolated across Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico, this represents a major unaccounted pool of soil C-org. As marshes continue to erode, the ability of coastal SAV habitat to offset someof the lost carbon sequestration may be valuable. Our estimates of C-org sequestration rates indicated that conversion of eroding marsh to potential SAV habitat may help to offset the reduction of C-org sequestration rates. Across Louisiana, we estimated SAV to offset this loss by as much as 79,000Mg C yr(-1) between the 1960s and 2000s. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Storm surges can substantially alter the water level and salinity in tidal salt marshes. Little is known about how changes experienced during storm surges affect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O) from tidal salt marsh soils. Understanding how storm surges influence ecosystem processes is critical for evaluating the ecosystem's sensitivity to sea level rise. To explore how hurricane-induced changes in salinity affect GHG emissions, we exposed intact soil mesocosms (0-9 cm depth) from a Mid-Atlantic temperate salt marsh to pulse changes in salinity experienced at the site before, during, and after Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Soil temperature, oxygen, and water level were kept constant to avoid confounding effects throughout the experiment. Automated measurements (hourly resolution) of soil GHG emissions were recorded in control (i.e., no salinity changes) and treatment mesocosms, and combined with soil pore water chemistry (i.e., SO42-, S2-, Fe2+, TNb, redox potential, pH) to characterize the biogeochemical responses. Using mixed effects models, we found that the role of different biogeochemical processes, such as sulfur cycling, changed throughout the experiment, underscoring the complex nature of GHG emissions in tidal salt marsh soils. Overall, soils subjected to a salinity decrease had greater GHG emissions than control soils, which were maintained at 17 ppt. The treatment soils had a 24% and 23% increase in global warming potential (20- and 100-year scenarios, respectively) indicating that storm surges can produce pulses of GHG emissions. However, both CH4 and N2O emissions returned to baseline values (following hysteresis responses) when initial conditions were reestablished.

AB  - Humic substances (HS) from salt marsh soils were characterized and the relationships among HS composition and some geochemical factors were analysed. For this, three salt marshes with the same vegetation cover (Juncus maritimus), but with different geochemical characteristics, were selected. The qualitative characterization of the soil humic acids and fulvic acids was carried out by elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and VACP/MAS C-13 NMR spectroscopy.
   HS from salt marsh soils under sea rush (Juncus maritimus) displayed some shared characteristics such as low degree of humification, low aromatic content and high proportion of labile compounds, mainly polysaccharides and proteins. However, although the three salt marsh soils under study were covered by the same type of vegetation, the HS showed some important differences. HS composition was found to be determined not only by the nature of the original organic material, but also by environmental factors such as soil texture, redox conditions and tidal influence. In general. an increase in the humification process appeared to be related to aerobic conditions and predominance of sand in the mineral fraction of the soil, while the preservation of labile organic compounds may be associated with low redox potential values and fine soil texture.

AB  - Coastal wetlands significantly contribute to global carbon storage potential. Sea-level rise and other climate-change-induced disturbances threaten coastal wetland sustainability and carbon storage capacity. It is critical that we understand the mechanisms controlling wetland carbon loss so that we can predict and manage these resources in anticipation of climate change. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that control soil organic matter decomposition, in particular the impacts of elevated salinity, are limited, and literature reports are contradictory. In an attempt to improve our understanding of these complex processes, we measured root and rhizome decomposition and developed a causal model to identify and quantify the mechanisms that influence soil organic matter decomposition in coastal wetlands that are impacted by sea-level rise. We identified three causal pathways: (1) a direct pathway representing the effects of flooding on soil moisture, (2) a direct pathway representing the effects of salinity on decomposer microbial communities and soil biogeochemistry, and (3) an indirect pathway representing the effects of salinity on litter quality through changes in plant community composition over time. We used this model to test the effects of alternate scenarios on the response of tidal freshwater forested wetlands and oligohaline marshes to short-and long-term climate-induced disturbances of flooding and salinity. In tidal freshwater forested wetlands, the model predicted less decomposition in response to drought, hurricane salinity pulsing, and long-term sea-level rise. In contrast, in the oligohaline marsh, the model predicted no change in response to drought and sea-level rise, and increased decomposition following a hurricane salinity pulse. Our results show that it is critical to consider the temporal scale of disturbance and the magnitude of exposure when assessing the effects of salinity intrusion on carbon mineralization in coastal wetlands. Here, we identify three causal mechanisms that can reconcile disparities between long-term and short-term salinity impacts on organic matter decomposition.

AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) have been widely used to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) carbon stock of coastal wetlands by establishing Vis-related linear models. However, these models always have high uncertainties due to the large spatial variation and fragmentation of coastal wetlands. In this paper, an efficient coastal wetland AGB model for the Bohami Rim coastal wetlands was presented based on multiple data sets. The model was developed statistically with 7 independent variables from 23 metrics derived from remote sensing, topography, and climate data. Compared to previous models, it had better performance, with a root mean square error and r value of 188.32 g m(-2) and 0.74, respectively. Using the model, we firstly generated a regional coastal wetland AGB map with a 10 m spatial resolution. Based on the AGB map, the AGB carbon stock of the Bohai Rim coastal wetland was 2.11 Tg C in 2019. The study demonstrated that integrating emerging high spatial resolution multi-remote sensing data and several auxiliary metrics can effectively improve VIs-based coastal wetland AGB models. Such models with emerging freely available data sets will allow for the rapid monitoring and better understanding of the special role that "blue carbon " plays in global carbon cycle.

AB  - Along the Florida coast, decreasing freeze events are promoting the range shift of the mangrove species Avicennia germinans northward into temperate salt marsh wetlands. Although plant species' ranges are tightly linked with their climatic tolerances, there is considerable variability in the magnitude by which biotic factors like competition and facilitation may also influence range shifts. Changes in mangrove and marsh plant abundance can alter both the above and belowground environment, which may in turn influence ecosystem services typically associated with these systems such as storm surge abatement and carbon storage. Therefore, it is key to understand (1) how the above and belowground environment of established salt marshes influences establishment of mangroves, and (2) how above and belowground environments shift in response to mangrove encroachment. Using a semi-natural mangrove planting experiment, we investigated the impact of four distinct marsh plant community structures (Batis maritima, Spartina alterniflora, mixture of B. maritima and S. alterniflora, mudflat) on mangrove survivorship and decomposition rate. In mixed marsh plots, mangrove survivorship was 42 % higher compared to survivorship in mudflat plots, and decomposition rate was 47 % greater in mixed marsh plots compared to mudflat. However, percent cover of vegetation differed across treatments, and was highest in mixed marsh plots. High survivorship in mixed marsh plots is likely due to increased protection from physical stressors by the dense aboveground cover, and belowground plant root-driven effects such as nutrient availability and oxygen delivery. Our findings suggest that above and below ground differences in salt marsh plant community structure can have an impact on the survival of encroaching mangroves, which may have implications for predicting future mangrove encroachment and improving mangrove restoration techniques.

AB  - Soil properties and soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from four coastal wetlands were studied throughout the year, namely, native Kandelia obovata mangrove forest vs. exotic Sonneratia apetala mangrove forest, and native Cyperus malaccensis salt marsh vs. exotic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Soils of the four wetlands were all net sources of greenhouse gases while Sonneratia forest contributed the most with a total soil-atmosphere CO2-equivalent flux of 137.27 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), which is 69.23%, 99.75% and 44.56% higher than that of Kandelia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively. The high underground biomass and distinctive root structure of Sonneratia might be responsible for its high greenhouse gas emission from the soil. Soils in Spartina marsh emitted the second largest amount of total greenhouse gases but it ranked first in emitting trace greenhouse gases. Annual average CH4 and N2O fluxes from Spartina soil were 13.77 and 1.14 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which are 2.08 and 1.46 times that of Kandelia, 1.03 and 1.15 times of Sonneratia, and 1.74 and 1.02 times of Cyperus, respectively. Spartina has longer growing season and higher productivity than native marshes which might increase greenhouse gas emission in cold seasons. Exotic wetland soils had higher carbon stock as compared to their respective native counterparts but their carbon stocks were offset by a larger proportion because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions. Annual total soil-atmosphere fluxes of greenhouse gases reduced soil carbon burial benefits by 8.1%, 9.5%, 6.4% and 7.2% for Kandelia, Sonneratia, Cyperus and Spartina, respectively, which narrowed down the gaps in net soil carbon stock between native and exotic wetlands. The results indicated that the invasion of exotic wetland plants might convert local coastal soils into a considerable atmospheric source of greenhouse gases although they at the same time increase soil carbon accumulation.

AB  - Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science. Specific recommendations are made to capture synergies between wetlands and carbon cycle management, adaptation and resiliency to further enable researchers, policy makers and practitioners to protect wetland carbon and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services.

AB  - The fate of soil carbon in eroding coastal wetlands is of great concern, given the potential for a feedback loop from coastal wetland soil that would dramatically increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top - 0-20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB  - Understanding how plants respond to environmental gradients and influence ecosystem functions remains a core challenge in ecology. Across species and ecosystems, plants have been shown to coordinate leaf, stem, and root traits along a gradient with optimal resource acquisition or conservation strategies at its extremes, termed the plant economic spectrum (PES), in turn driving ecosystem functioning. PES theory has been successfully applied in coastal wetlands to disentangle how the strong abiotic gradients affect ecosystem functions, such as litter decomposition. Yet, wetlands can be dominated by monospecific stands, and it remains unclear whether the PES applies within species. Here, focusing on a globally widespread salt marsh plant, Spartina anglica, we investigated: a) if the PES holds at the intraspecific level along critical abiotic stress gradients (redox potential and soil salinity); b) how intraspecific changes in plant traits along the PES affect litter decomposition; and c) whether these changes in plant strategies influence the abundance of key macro-detritivores, mediating litter decomposition. We found remarkable variation in S. anglica leaf and stem traits, coordinating along the PES and adopting a conservative strategy under stronger abiotic stress. Unexpectedly, leaves with a conservative strategy (higher leaf dry matter content and C/N ratio) attracted more macro-detritivores and decomposed faster. Other facets of litter quality beyond C/N seem to drive these counter-intuitive effects: leaves with a conservative strategy were likely more palatable because of higher protein content and lower toughness (low total carbohydrate content). Our study highlights that intraspecific trait variability can strongly drive litter decomposition, potentially impacting on the carbon storage capacity of salt marshes; and that specific stress-resistance traits can disrupt the PES - ecosystem function relationship.

AB  - Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites' contributions to soil volume enhance marsh sustainability in face of sea level rise, and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Phragmites australis (common reed) is a cosmopolitan species growing in fresh to brackish wetlands. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades but has been little studied on the estuarine portion. We collected soil cores from three sites within an invasive Phragmites stand and one site within S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume, and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at each Phragmites site. Bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm-thick soil layers of three cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services.

AB  - Large scale dieback of Spartina alterniflora poses a threat to salt marsh ecosystem function. Several hypothesized drivers of recent dieback events have been proposed, however, some aspects of salt marsh soil composition and dieback recurrence remain unexplored. We surveyed soil conditions in dieback affected zones and unaffected zones in two marshes on Sapelo Island, Georgia during a drought year to test whether dieback is associated with spatial variations in soil properties such as pH, salinity, water retention and texture. We also surveyed previously documented dieback locations to test whether dieback zones exhibit spatial recurrence. Tidal salt marshes showed significant spatial variability in three physical soil characteristics and exhibited strong associations with zones of S. alterniflora dieback. Sediments in dieback zones had lower silt content, higher bulk density and lower field capacity (a measure of water retention) relative to healthy S. alterniflora stands. Dieback zones also showed patterns of spatial recurrence and similarities with vegetation free areas. These data suggest that the legacy of dieback may be reflected in soils making certain areas susceptible to further dieback during drought periods.

AB  - In tidal marshes, spatial and temporal variability in the importance of microbial metabolic pathways influences ecosystem-level processes such as soil carbon storage, the regeneration of inorganic nutrients, and the production of atmospherically important trace gases. We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron-sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plantmediated processes. In midsummer, Fe(III) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe(III) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils. Our data suggested that variations in microbial metabolic pathways were regulated by physiochemical factors at the brackish site and plant activity at the freshwater site. Plant regulation of Fe(III) reduction is a largely unstudied mechanism by which plants influence wetland carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems on Earth. Long-term carbon storage in coastal wetlands occurs primarily belowground as soil organic matter (SOM). In addition to serving as a carbon sink, SOM influences wetland ecosystem structure, function, and stability. To anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a need to advance understanding of environmental controls on wetland SOM. Here, we investigated the influence of four soil formation factors: climate, biota, parent materials, and topography. Along the northern Gulf of Mexico, we collected wetland plant and soil data across elevation and zonation gradients within 10 estuaries that span broad temperature and precipitation gradients. Our results highlight the importance of climate-plant controls and indicate that the influence of elevation is scale and location dependent. Coastal wetland plants are sensitive to climate change; small changes in temperature or precipitation can transform coastal wetland plant communities. Across the region, SOM was greatest in mangrove forests and in salt marshes dominated by graminoid plants. SOM was lower in salt flats that lacked vascular plants and in salt marshes dominated by succulent plants. We quantified strong relationships between precipitation, salinity, plant productivity, and SOM. Low precipitation leads to high salinity, which limits plant productivity and appears to constrain SOM accumulation. Our analyses use data from the Gulf of Mexico, but our results can be related to coastal wetlands across the globe and provide a foundation for predicting the ecological effects of future reductions in precipitation and freshwater availability. Coastal wetlands provide many ecosystem services that are SOM dependent and highly vulnerable to climate change. Collectively, our results indicate that future changes in SOM and plant productivity, regulated by cascading effects of precipitation on freshwater availability and salinity, could impact wetland stability and affect the supply of some wetland ecosystem services.

AB  - Coastal wetlands store more carbon than most ecosystems globally. As sea level rises, changes in flooding and salinity will potentially impact ecological functions, such as organic matter decomposition, that influence carbon storage. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control organic matter loss in coastal wetlands at the landscape scale. As sea level rises, how will the shift from fresh to salt-tolerant plant communities impact organic matter decomposition? Do long-term, plant-mediated, effects of sea-level rise differ from direct effects of elevated salinity and flooding?
   We identified internal and external factors that regulated indirect and direct pathways of sea-level rise impacts, respectively, along a landscape-scale salinity gradient that incorporated changes in wetland type (fresh, oligohaline, mesohaline and polyhaline marshes). We found that indirect and direct impacts of sea-level rise had opposing effects on organic matter decomposition.
   Salinity had an indirect effect on litter decomposition that was mediated through litter quality. Despite significant variation in environmental conditions along the landscape gradient, the best predictors of above- and below-ground litter decomposition were internal drivers, initial litter nitrogen content and initial litter lignin content respectively. Litter decay constants were greatest in the oligohaline marsh and declined with increasing salinity, and the fraction of litter remaining (asymptote) was greatest in the mesohaline marsh. In contrast, direct effects of salinity and flooding were positive. External drivers, salinity and flooding, stimulated cellulytic activity, which was highest in the polyhaline marsh.
   Synthesis. Our results indicate that as sea level rises, initial direct effects of salinity will stimulate decay of labile carbon, but over time as plant communities shift from fresh to polyhaline marsh, litter decay will decline, yielding greater potential for long-term carbon storage. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying carbon loss at multiple temporal scales, not only in coastal wetlands but also in other ecosystems where plant-mediated responses to climate change will have significant impacts on carbon cycling.

AB  - The role of coastal wetlands as natural 'blue carbon' sinks may be counter-acted by emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Site-specific fluxes of these two potent greenhouse gases from coastal wetlands show high spatial and temporal variability , making global estimates sensitive to statistical assumptions and uncertainties. Here, we review the magnitude of CH4 and N2O fluxes from mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses and identify direct and indirect drivers that can control production and consumption pathways. Significant research is required to better quantify fluxes and to understand factors causing flux variability from different transport pathways before restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems can be reliably used for climate mitigation.
   Plain Language Summary Mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass meadows are 'blue carbon' ecosystems that provide a wide range of societal benefits, including carbon storage in their sediments and biomass in the case of mangroves. Yet they can also be a source-and sometimes a sink-of two powerful greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide. Many processes are involved in the release and uptake of these gases; as a result, the local variability of coastal wetland emissions is high and global budgets are uncertain. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is worthwhile for many reasons, and their existing carbon stores need to be kept intact. Nevertheless, their potential as a natural climate solution needs further attention, since it may have been over-stated.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are among the most economically valuable and highly threatened on Earth; they provide valuable ecosystem services (ESs) but are severely exposed to climate changes and human pressure. Although the preservation of coastal ecosystems is of the utmost importance, it is often sub-optimally pursued by Governments and Societies because of the high costs involved. We consider salt-marsh ecosystems in the Venice Lagoon as an example of a threatened landscape, calling for innovative, integrated management strategies, and propose an application-driven methodological framework to support policymakers in the identification of cost-effective incentive policies to ecosystem preservation. By combining group decision-making and Value-Focused-Thinking approaches, we provide a multiple-criteria decision model, based on pairwise comparisons, to identify which ESs are top-priority policy targets according to a cost-effective perspective. We implemented an online Delphi survey process and interviewed a pool of experts who identified "recreation and tourism", "coastal protection from flooding", "carbon storage", "biodiversity and landscape", and "nursery habitats for fisheries" as the five most relevant ESs for the Venice Lagoon taking into consideration the Environmental, Economic, and Social perspectives. Our results suggest that the Environmental perspective is the most important criteria, whereas "biodiversity and landscape" is acknowledged as the most important ES.

AB  - Soil samples were collected in tidal freshwater and salt marshes in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), northern China, before and after the flow-sediment regulation. Total concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate the characteristics of heavy metal pollution in tidal wetlands before and after the regulation regime. The results demonstrated that marsh soils in both marshes had higher silt and total P contents, higher bulk density and lower sand contents after the flow-sediment regulation; moreover, soil salinity was significantly decreased in the tidal salt marsh. As and Cd concentrations were significantly higher in both marsh soils after the regulation than before, and there were no significant differences in the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn measured before and after the regulation. No significant differences in heavy metal concentrations were observed between freshwater and salt marsh soils, either before or after the regulation. Before the regulation regime, soil organic matter, pH and sulfer (S) were the main factors influencing heavy metal distribution in tidal freshwater marshes, whereas for tidal salt marshes, the main factors are soil salinity and moisture, pH and S. However, bulk density and total P became the main influencing factors after the regulation. The sediment quality guidelines and geoaccumulation indices showed moderately or strongly polluted levels of As and Cd and unpolluted or moderately polluted levels of Cu, Pb and Zn; As and Cd pollution became more serious after the regulation. Factor analysis indicated thatthese heavy metals including As were closely correlated and orginated from common pollution sources before the flow-sediment regulation; however, the sources of As and Cd separated from the sources of Cu, Pb and Zn after the regulation regime, implying that the flow-sediment regulation regime contributed to As and Cd accumulation in the YRD.

AB  - Coastal wetland is a net carbon sink with a high carbon density. However, coastal reclamation directly changes the structure of coastal wetland ecosystem and consequent carbon sink function. The aim of this work was to estimate the reclamation-induced carbon loss in coastal wetlands using time series GF-1 WVF data. For this purpose, GF-1 WVF imageries of 2013 (before reclamation) and 2017 (after reclamation) in the Yangtze Estuary were collected and analyzed combined with field monitoring. Results showed that the converted coastal wetland area occupied up to 61.60% between 2013 and 2017. Carbon estimation indicated that the coastal wetland before reclamation had greater potential contribution to the global warming mitigation than the wetland reclamation to other land cover types. Finally the vulnerability of carbon stores and uncertain analysis with remote sensing technology in coastal wetlands environment were discussed. We emphasized that long-term monitoring of coastal wetlands and its carbon dynamic are urgently needed, because so many uncertain factors exist in short-term monitoring.

AB  - Tidal marshes are valued, protected and restored in recognition of their ecosystem services: (1) high productivity and habitat provision supporting the food web leading to fish and wildlife, (2) buffer against storm wave damage, (3) shoreline stabilization, (4) flood water storage, (5) water quality maintenance, (6) biodiversity preservation, (7) carbon storage and (8) socio-economic benefits. Under US law, federal and state governments have joint responsibility for facilitating restoration to compensate quantitatively for ecosystem services lost because of oil spills and other contaminant releases on tidal marshes. This responsibility is now met by choosing and employing metrics (proxies) for the suite of ecosystem services to quantify injury and scale restoration accordingly. Most injury assessments in tidal marshes are triggered by oil spills and are limited to: (1) documenting areas covered by heavy, moderate and light oiling; (2) estimating immediate above-ground production toss (based on stem density and height) of the dominant vascular plants within each oiling intensity category and (3) sampling sediments for chemical analyses and depth of contamination, followed by sediment toxicity assays if sediment contamination is high and likely to persist. The percentage of immediate loss of ecosystem services is then estimated along with the recovery trajectory. Here, we review potential metrics that might refine or replace present metrics for marsh injury assessment. Stratifying plant sampling by the more productive marsh edge versus the less accessible interior would improve resolution of injury and provide greater confidence that restoration is truly compensatory. Using microphytobenthos abundance, cotton-strip decomposition bioassays and other biogeochemical indicators, or sum of production across consumer trophic levels faits as a stand-alone substitute metric. Below-ground plant biomass holds promise as a potential proxy for resiliency but requires further testing. Under some conditions, like chronic contamination by organic pollutants that affect animals but not vascular plants, benthic infaunal density, toxicity testing, and tissue contamination, growth, reproduction and mortality of marsh vertebrates deserve inclusion in the assessment protocol. Additional metrics are sometimes justified to assay microphytobenthos, use by nekton, food and habitat for reptiles, birds and mammals, or support of plant diversity. Empirical research on recovery trajectories in previously injured marshes could reduce the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying cumulative service losses.

AB  - Above-ground biomass represents a small yet significant contributor to carbon storage in coastal wetlands. Despite this, above-ground biomass is often poorly quantified, particularly in areas where vegetation structure is complex. Traditional methods for providing accurate estimates involve harvesting vegetation to develop mangrove allometric equations and quantify saltmarsh biomass in quadrats. However broad scale application of these methods may not capture structural variability in vegetation resulting in a loss of detail and estimates with considerable uncertainty. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) collects high resolution three-dimensional point clouds capable of providing detailed structural morphology of vegetation. This study demonstrates that TLS is a suitable non-destructive method for estimating biomass of structurally complex coastal wetland vegetation. We compare volumetric models, 3-D surface reconstruction and rasterised volume, and point cloud elevation histogram modelling techniques to estimate biomass. Our results show that current volumetric modelling approaches for estimating TLS-derived biomass are comparable to traditional mangrove allometrics and saltmarsh harvesting. However, volumetric modelling approaches oversimplify vegetation structure by under utilising the large amount of structural information provided by the point cloud. The point cloud elevation histogram model presented in this study, as an alternative to volumetric modelling, utilises all of the information within the point cloud, as opposed to sub-sampling based on specific criteria. This method is simple but highly effective for both mangrove (r(2) = 0.95) and saltmarsh (r(2) > 0.92) vegetation. Our results provide evidence that application of TB in coastal wetlands is an effective non-destructive method to accurately quantify biomass for structurally complex vegetation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in global carbon sequestration, and exotic S. alterniflora affects the coastal ecosystem's functions including SOC storage (SOCS). We investigated the vertical deep soil SOC distribution (0-300 cm) in Jiangsu salt marsh and estimated its changes. The results show that (1) exotic S. alterniflora increases the SOC, with higher densities (g kg(-1)) in both topsoil and deep soil in its colonized area, and subsequently increases the SOCS vertical depth (cm) distribution. Such influences become more prominent with time since the introduction of S. alterniflora. The deepest SOC distribution (180 cm) and the highest SOC content (2.14 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1)) in the deep layer( 50-300 cm) were found in the zones where S. salsa - S. alterniflora co-exist (SSI). The vertical SOC distribution in zones where multi-species co-exists is deeper than that in mono-species dominated zones; (2) The deep soil (100-300 cm) SOC accounts more than 50% of 0-300 cm SOC in Jiangsu salt marsh, suggesting that SOC content of deep soil should not be ignored when calculating the global soil carbon stock; (3) Total SOCS within 0-300 cm in Jiangsu salt marshes (107.84 x 10(6) m(2)) is 84.90 x 10(10) g, of which 0-100 cm, 100-200 cm and 200-300 cm layer accounts for 38.25%, 30.72% and 31.03%, respectively. The size of the SOCS (0-300 cm) in the Jiangsu salt marshes relatively to the global biome (0.36 x 10(-6)) is in a lower proportion of the range of salt marsh area to global biome area (0.89 x 10(-6)). The S. alterniflora salt marsh contributes most of the SOCS in the 0-300 cm and 0-100 cm soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Runaway expansion of shallow ponds can catalyze the conversion of vegetated marshes into open water environments. Predicting how this transition affects ecosystem functioning is difficult because little is known about pond biogeochemistry. We characterized sediment organic matter sources and transformations in three ponds with different plant communities, over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, using a combination of stable isotopes, lipid biomarkers, and benthic fluxes. Sediment respiration rates (1.66 +/- 0.09 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) to 28.53 +/- 7.76 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to shallow estuaries and driven by sulfate reduction. Rates varied across ponds, reflecting differences in summertime Ruppia maritima and macroalgae abundances, but were similar between seasons. Interactions between above-ground plant and sediment bacterial communities translated into distinct biogeochemical processes across the three ponds. Tidal isolation and summer weather intensified plant and bacterial community effects on pond carbon dynamics, resulting in algal biomass and lipid delta C-13 values that were 3-12 parts per thousand enriched, compared to nearby habitats. Surface sediment organic matter mainly derived from pond microalgae and was compositionally distinct from tidal creeks and marshes. Surprisingly, sediment bacteria were not tightly coupled to benthic microalgae but decomposed multiple carbon sources in surface sediments and became increasingly reliant on buried peat at deeper horizons. Pond development over time could largely be explained by sediment respiration and the simultaneous accretion of the surrounding marsh platform. The role of decomposition in pond expansion is consistent with previous assessments based on whole-pond metabolism rates. Consequently, future pond expansion could alter ecosystem biogeochemistry and reduce carbon storage.

AB  - To investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents and stocks in tidal salt marsh soils, 15 cores to a depth of 40 cm were collected in five sampling sites along a sampling belt during three seasons. Our results showed that higher SOC and TN contents occurred in the surface soils in three sampling seasons. Spatial distributions of SOC and TN showed moderate variability. The C/N ratios were higher in the summer and autumn than in spring. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and soil total nitrogen density (TND) ranked in the following order: autumn > spring > summer. And the SOCD values positively correlated with the distances from the tidal creek in summer, while this correlation was negative in autumn and spring. The soil properties, such as the soil moisture, salinity, C/N ratio and C/P ratio, significantly correlated with the SOC and TN contents and stocks. The water and salinity regulation and the alternation of ratios of ecological stoichiometry should be considered to strengthen carbon and nitrogen sequestration in coastal wetlands.

AB  - In semiarid Sahelian region, the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and water are key to sustainable land management. This work focuses on the behaviour of carbon. A total of 33 soil profiles in four polders, ranging from 10 to 65 years in age, were sampled, analysed (01 m), and matched with marsh soil profiles in recent sediments considered as reference (t(0)) for carbon stocks determination. SOC and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) stocks show a spatial variability between polders. SOC stocks were t(0) 200 +/- 0.8; t(60) 183 +/- 34; and t(65) 189 +/- 1.1 MgC.ha(-1), whereas the SIC stocks were negligible. These results show the highest stocks of soil carbon observed for this climatic region. The SOC stocks were also calculated for the equivalent soil mass at a defined depth (00.3 m); the corrected calculation of SOC stocks (S-corr) for 2450 Mg.ha(-1) of equivalent soil mass is t(0) 64 +/- 1.9, t(60) 59 +/- 9.8, and t(65) 53 +/- 2.2 MgC.ha(-1); the stocks decrease by -7.8% and -17.2% from t0 to t60 and t65. Carbon was inherited from the pre-existing.marsh and the polders have conserved high stock values. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Academie des sciences.

AB  - Tidal saline wetlands (TSW), such as mangrove and salt marsh systems, provide many valuable ecosystem services, but continue to suffer disturbance, degradation and deforestation. Tropical mangroves perform a critical role in the exchange and storage of terrestrial-marine carbon but can function as a source of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, little is known of biogeochemical processes in temperate mangrove and salt marsh systems in the southern hemisphere. In this study, the soil/sediment exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O was measured seasonally along a natural transition from melaleuca woodland, salt marsh and into mangroves along the Mornington Peninsula edge of Westernport Bay, Victoria, Australia. Soil/sediment physiochemical properties and sediment C density were measured concurrently.
   The melaleuca woodland soil was a constant CH4 sink of approximately -25 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) but along the transect this rapidly switched to a weak CH4 source (<5 mu g C m(-2) h(-1)) in the salt marsh which increased further in the mangrove sediments where emissions of up to 375 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) were measured in summer. Sediment CH4 exchange correlated with salinity, pneumatophore number and the redox potential of sediment water at depth. All three ecosystems were a small N2O source of <10 mu g N m(-2) h(-1). Soil-atmosphere exchange was dominated by CO2 which showed a significant response according to ecosystem and season along with soil temperature and salinity. Sediment C density was significantly greater in the salt marsh than the mangrove. Salt marsh sediment C density was 168 Mg C ha(-1) which is comparable with that measured globally, whereas the mangrove sediment C density of 145 Mg C ha(-1) is among the lowest reported. Contrary to global patterns in terrestrial soil C content and salt marsh sediment C content, data from our study indicate that mangrove sediments from a cooler, drier temperate latitude may store less C than mangroves in warmer and wetter tropical latitudes. Understanding both C storage and the greenhouse gas balance of TSWs will help us to better value these vulnerable ecosystems and manage them accordingly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal marshes have been recognized globally for their ability to sequester "blue carbon" but there is still a need for studies investigating the marsh response to restoration, particularly in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we report carbon stocks and accumulation rates for restored and natural tidal marshes in the Stillaguamish River estuary in Puget Sound, Washington, where a 60-hectare marsh was reintroduced to the tidal regime from its previous use as diked and drained farmland. We found that the restoration not only maximized carbon accumulation but also enhanced resilience to rising sea levels. Four years after restoration, mean sediment carbon stocks in the upper 30 cm within the restored marsh (4.43 kg C m(-2)) were slightly lower than those measured in the adjacent natural marshes (5.95 kg C m(-2)). Mean carbon accumulation rates, however, were nearly twice as high in the restored marsh (230.49 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the natural marshes (123.00 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) due to high rates of accretion in the restored marsh (1.57 cm yr(-1)). Mean elevation change rates were nearly twice that of corresponding Pb-210 accretion rates, but all were greater than the current rate of sea level rise.

AB  - 'Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53% in tidal marshes, 36% in seagrasses, and 11% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over $AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of $AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90% remineralization of stocks), 98% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

AB  - We compared the influence of invasion by an alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora, smooth cordgrass) and a native aggressive species (Phragmites australis, common reed) as they have expanded into the native Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass)-dominated wetland ecosystem in the Min River estuary of southeast China. S. alterniflora is a perennial grass native to North America, which has spread rapidly along the southeast coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Our study compared the above and belowground biomass, net primary production, litter decomposition, plant nutrient stocks and soil organic carbon storage of the grasses in three ecosystems: (1) the native ecosystem dominated by C malaccensis: (2) ecosystems previously dominated by C malaccensis but presently replaced by P. australis; and (3) ecosystems previously dominated by C. malaccensis but presently replaced by S. alterniflora. Our results demonstrate that the recent invasion (3 years) of the exotic invasive species S. alterniflora has already significantly increased live aboveground biomass and aboveground plant nutrient stocks. However, there was no significant difference in these variables between native aggressive species P. australis and native C malaccensis. The majority of belowground root Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks of the three plant species were all distributed in the upper surface layer and there was a decrease with soil depth. There was little difference in litter decomposition rates among the three grass species; they were ranked in the following order: C malaccensis > S. alterniflora > P. australis. Litter element concentration showed similar patterns for the three species. However, important differences were found between N and P; the litter N concentrations in each of the three species were greater at the end of the 280 days decomposition than at the start, but P concentrations followed a fluctuating pattern during the decomposition period. Soil organic carbon stocks (0-50 cm) under S. alterniflora. P. australis and C malaccensis stands were statistically indistinguishable, which may be due to the invasion of S. alterniflora having been a relatively recent phenomenon. Thus, recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora has already altered the nutrient cycle of C. malaccensis in the ecosystem in the Min River estuary. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

AB  - A large imbalance in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs induced by anthropogenic activities is anticipated to profoundly influence soil carbon (C) budgets in salt marshes. In this study, we hypothesized that imbalances in the nitrogen-phosphorus (N-P) input would result in the nonlinear response of soil organic carbon (SOC) content, fractions and mineralization to the N-P input ratio. We applied three N-P input ratios (low (5:1), medium (15:1), high (45:1)) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) for four years (in which N added increased from 8.67 to 26.01 g N m(-2) y(-1) and P added decreased from 1.73 to 0.58 g P m(-2) y(-1)) and quantified their impacts on SOC fractions and SOC mineralisation. The control treatment did not receive fertilization. The results showed that the N and P input led to overall increases in the availability of soil nutrients (i.e., inorganic N (IN) and available P (AP)), stimulation of plant biomass and changes of microbial community structure (i.e., gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). N and P input increased soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and decreased aromatic DOC components through improving N availability and stimulating plant growth. Notably, though, there may be a threshold N-P input ratio between 15:1 and 45:1 that, once crossed, triggers the loss of SOC. Appropriate increase in N availability induced by low and medium N-P input ratios would stimulate the SOC mineralization. However, excessive N-P input ratio would reduce SOC mineralization. Path analysis indicated that N-P input ratios dominantly regulate SOC mineralisation by changing soil DOC and microbial biomass (MBC)contents and microbial community structure. Thus, we speculate that the continuous increase in N input causes a growing N-P imbalance that reduces SOC stocks, despite a reduction in SOC mineralisation.

AB  - The burial of "blue carbon" in coastal marsh soils is partially offset by marsh-atmosphere methane (CH4) fluxes, but this offset may be greater if other pathways of CH4 export exist. Here we report that salt marshes also export dissolved CH4 via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The volumetric fluxes of salt marsh groundwater into adjacent tidal creeks were calculated from mass balances of the conservative tracer Ra-226 at four study sites in coastal Georgia, USA. Over the 2-year study period, volumetric groundwater fluxes across all sites ranged between 1,700 and 105,000 m(3) day(-1). Dissolved CH4 fluxes of 27-1,200 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1) were calculated by multiplying the volumetric groundwater flux by the groundwater CH4 concentration and normalizing to the intertidal salt marsh area estimated from satellite images. On a mass basis, the cross-site range in CH4 fluxes was 1.3-5.5 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1) with a cross-site mean of 2.8 g CH4 m(-2) year(-1). This is equivalent to 125 (56-245) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) assuming that CH4 is 45 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year time frame. This sustained-flux global warming potential is similar to the 138 (1.1-260) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) average calculated across other studies of the direct marsh soil to atmosphere CH4 flux. Therefore, SGD drives an effective doubling of salt marsh CH4 export that offsets a combined total of similar to 30% of the global cooling potential derived from soil carbon sequestration.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marshes are wetland ecosystems found along the coast. Scientists and policymakers are interested in salt marshes because they accumulate carbon in their soil over long time scales. This carbon would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, exacerbating global climate change. However, microorganisms living in the soil break down some of this buried carbon and produce other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that contribute more to warming than carbon dioxide. Scientists have measured how much methane escapes from the soil to the atmosphere. Carbon burial more than offsets this methane export, meaning that salt marshes have a small net cooling effect on Earth's climate. In this study, we incorporate a previously unaccounted pathway for methane export from salt marshes into their radiative budget. Methane in marsh soil and surrounding sediments can be dissolved in groundwater that discharges from the pore spaces between soil and sediment particles. This groundwater flows slowly toward the marsh edge until it discharges into nearby surface waters, carrying dissolved methane with it. We estimate that this methane export from groundwater approximately doubles total methane emissions from salt marshes. This is still not enough methane export to counteract all of the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils. However, it is important for policymakers to include both pathways of methane export when calculating the climate cooling benefit of carbon burial in salt marsh soils or its economic value.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They generate critical services for humans including shoreline protection, carbon storage, pollution mitigation, and fisheries production. Restoration of coastal wetlands has historically been viewed as a secondary conservation strategy, but recently-given the continued loss of wetlands worldwide-many non-governmental and governmental organizations have elevated habitat restoration to be a primary method for wetland conservation. The long-held paradigm in coastal wetland restoration has been to restore target habitats by reducing physical stressors and avoiding competition among outplants, such as mangrove saplings or Spartina plugs. Recent ecological research, however, reveals that positive species interactions, such as facilitation, are critical to wetland recovery after disturbance. Here, we review the scientific evidence for the importance of positive species interactions in the recovery of salt-marsh and mangrove ecosystems and assess the extent to which they have been integrated into restoration studies. We found that only a small proportion of studies of marsh and mangrove restoration examined the effects of positive species interactions, despite the important role they play in the regrowth of coastal wetlands. We outline how positive species interactions can be systematically incorporated into future restoration work and discuss how this incorporation can help the reestablishment of coastal wetland biota through: (1) trophic facilitation, (2) stress reduction, and (3) associational defenses. The absence of positive interactions in restoration designs may partially explain the significant disparities between the functioning of natural and restored coastal plant ecosystems.

AB  - Oceans and coasts provide a wide array of services to humans, including climate regulation, food security, and livelihoods. Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as blue' carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

AB  - I identify the major tropical ecosystems in Australia that are most vulnerable to tipping points, in which modest environmental changes can cause disproportionately large changes in ecosystem properties. To accomplish this, I surveyed 24 researchers in Australia to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, which was then refined during a workshop in late 2010. The list includes (1) montane rainforests; (2) tropical savannas; (3) tropical floodplains and wetlands; (4) coral reefs; (5) drier rainforests; (6) tropical islands; and (7) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem I consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that appear especially vulnerable.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide important services to human population, such as nurseries for fish, carbon storage and coastal protection. However, the pressure faced by these systems due to global changes will strongly challenge the capacity of coastal ecosystems to persist. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the resilience of coastal ecosystems.
   Here, I propose that combining a resilience framework based on ecosystem properties with the functional trait response-effect framework would allow researchers and managers to quantify the resilience of coastal ecosystems. I place emphasis on salt marsh and sand dunes because of the higher availability of studies for these systems.
   First, I introduce the resilience framework based on ecosystem properties and, second, I show how adopting a functional trait perspective in this framework would allow researchers to link how environmental changes influence ecosystem properties. In turn, measuring the changes in ecosystem properties would allow researchers to measure the resilience of the system.
   Synthesis. I reviewed several types of disturbances (e.g. storms and sea-level rise) that are threatening the persistence of coastal ecosystems, with an emphasis on salt marshes and sand dunes. Applying this resilience framework reveals, for instance, that the same suite of traits (e.g. plant density and stiffness) increase marsh resistance to multiple threats (e.g. storms and sea-level rise); yet, these traits vary along environmental gradients (e.g. along estuaries) and, therefore, marshes resilience vary accordingly. Overall, this framework would allow researchers to gather crucial insights on the resilience of coastal ecosystems and to set reference marks for measuring their resilience under environmental changes.

AB  - A comparison of gouge and hammer coring techniques in intertidal wetland soils highlights a significant effect of soil compaction of up to 28% associated with the widely applied hammer coring method employed in Blue Carbon research. Hammer coring reduces the thickness of the soil profile and increases the dry bulk density, which results in an overestimation of the soil OC stock of up to 22%. In saltmarshes with multiple different soil units, we show that hammer coring is unsuitable for the calculation of OC stocks and should be avoided in favour of Russian or gouge cores. Compaction changes both soil dry bulk density and porosity and we show that resultant radiometric chronologies are compromised, almost doubling mass accumulation rates. While we show that the OC (%) content of these sediments is largely unchanged by coring method, the implication for OC burial rates are profound because of the significant effect of hammer coring on the calculation of soil mass accumlation rates.

AB  - We identify the 10 major terrestrial and marine ecosystems in Australia most vulnerable to tipping points, in which modest environmental changes can cause disproportionately large changes in ecosystem properties. To accomplish this we independently surveyed the coauthors of this paper to produce a list of candidate ecosystems, and then refined this list during a 2-day workshop. The list includes (1) elevationally restricted mountain ecosystems, (2) tropical savannas, (3) coastal floodplains and wetlands, (4) coral reefs, (5) drier rainforests, (6) wetlands and floodplains in the Murray-Darling Basin, (7) the Mediterranean ecosystems of southwestern Australia, (8) offshore islands, (9) temperate eucalypt forests, and (10) salt marshes and mangroves. Some of these ecosystems are vulnerable to widespread phase-changes that could fundamentally alter ecosystem properties such as habitat structure, species composition, fire regimes, or carbon storage. Others appear susceptible to major changes across only part of their geographic range, whereas yet others are susceptible to a large-scale decline of key biotic components, such as small mammals or stream-dwelling amphibians. For each ecosystem we consider the intrinsic features and external drivers that render it susceptible to tipping points, and identify subtypes of the ecosystem that we deem to be especially vulnerable.

AB  - Tidal marshes are one of the world's most economically valuable habitats; yet, they have experienced large and persistent declines globally. Increased knowledge of the ecosystem services delivered by marshes has become a powerful tool to conserve and restore them. But hesitancies regarding valuations and their application in decision-making remain. Here we draw on the literature and collective experience of participants in the "Concepts and controversies in tidal Marsh ecology revisited" workshop, November 2 and 3, 2019, Mobile, AL, to provide a concise snapshot of the current field of salt marsh ecosystem service valuation, discuss the possible risks in salt marsh valuation, and the importance of stakeholder engagement to mitigate them. We provide examples of the application of valuation in conservation-related decision-making, illustrating the growing operationalization of ecosystem services in incentivizing salt marsh conservation and restoration. Ecosystem service quantification and valuation is already playing an important role in decision-making by coastal risk managers, insurers, engineers, and policy makers. While there are legitimate criticisms of valuation techniques and remaining uncertainties in ecosystem service delivery that arise both through natural variability across space and time and through differing and shifting cultural values, our perspective is that the rise of big data, the development of valuation techniques, a growing understanding and application of environmental justice practices, and increasing interdisciplinarity to tackle these complex issues are paving the way for valuation to play a critical role in decision-making around salt marshes.

AB  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora accumulates organic carbon rapidly and can utilize a wide range of potential precursors for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production, as well as a wide variety of methanogenic substrates. Therefore, we predicted that S. alterniflora invasion would alter the relationships between DMS and methane (CH4) fluxes along the interacting gradients of tidal influence and vegetation, as well as the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4. In this study, we used static flux chambers to measure DMS and CH4 fluxes in August (growing season) and December (non-growing season) of 2013, along creek and vegetation transects in an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh. S. alterniflora invasion dramatically increased DMS and CH4 emission rates by 3.8-513.0 and 2.0-127.1 times the emission rates within non-vegetated regions and regions populated with native species, respectively, and significantly altered the spatial distribution of DMS and CH4 emissions. We also observed a substantial amount of variation in the DMS and CH4 fluxes along the elevation gradient in the salt marsh studied. A significant relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was observed, with the CH4 flux passively related to the DMS flux. The correlation between CH4 and DMS emissions along the vegetation transects was more significant than along the tidal creek. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, the relationship between DMS and CH4 fluxes was more significant than within any other salt marsh. Additionally, CH4 emissions within the S. alterniflora salt marsh were more sensitive to the variation in DMS emissions than within any other vegetation zone. The spatial variability in the relationship observed between DMS and CH4 fluxes appears to be at least partly due to the alteration of substrates involved in DMS and CH4 by S. alterniflora invasion. In the S. alterniflora salt marsh, methanogenesis was more likely to be derived from noncompetitive substrates than competitive substrates, but within the creek and other vegetation zones, methanogenesis was inhibited by sulfate reduction. This suggests that methanogenesis and sulfate reduction were spatially isolated within the coastal salt marsh. Therefore, we conclude that the invasive S. alterniflora altered the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of DMS and CH4 and the responses of the relationship between these two gases to interacting gradients of tidal inundation and vegetation within an Eastern Chinese coastal salt marsh.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes have recently been identified as important components of 'blue carbon' sinks, will continue to maintain C accumulation for millennia, but have been seriously lost or degraded worldwide mainly owing to land reclamation. Most work to date has concentrated on the effects of habitat conversion or destruction on C sequestration potential, while relatively less attention has been put on their impacts on large standing soil C pool (previously sequestered and stored soil C) associated with salt marshes. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence to determine reclamation effects on previously sequestered soil C pool in salt marshes after nine years following reclamation. Our results showed that soil moisture significantly decreased and soil microbial biomass significantly increased along with the transition from salt marshes to reclaimed lands. Meanwhile, soil respiration was three-folds higher in reclaimed lands than in salt marshes. Consequently, soil organic C pool in reclaimed lands declined to 60% (0-20 cm) and 79% (0-100 cm) of those in salt marshes after nine years. We may speculate that half-life of topsoil C pool of salt marshes after reclamation is approximately 10 years, and previously sequestered and stored soil C pool may decline to the minimum value within roughly 15 years. Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of previously sequestered soil C, once effectively 'locked up' in salt marshes mainly due to anaerobic conditions, is vulnerable to saltmarsh habitat loss and can be rapidly released into the atmosphere (as CO2) contributing to global warming within a short period after reclamation.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing has enabled robust shotgun metagenomic sequencing that informs our understanding of the genetic basis of important biogeochemical processes. Slower to develop, however, are the application of these tools in a controlled experimental framework that pushes the field beyond exploratory analysis toward hypothesis-driven research. We performed flow-through reactor experiments to examine how salt marsh sediments from varying depths respond to nitrate addition and linked biogeochemical processes to this underlying genetic foundation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marsh sediments is critical for predicting how important ecosystem services provided by marshes, including carbon storage and nutrient removal, will respond to global change. Prior to the addition of nitrate, we used metagenomics to examine the functional potential of the sediment microbial community that occurred along a depth gradient, where organic matter reactivity changes due to decomposition. Metagenomic data indicated that genes encoding enzymes involved in respiration, including denitrification, were higher in shallow sediments, and genes indicative of resource limitation were greatest at depth. After 92 d of nitrate enrichment, we measured cumulative increases in dissolved inorganic carbon production, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; these rates correlated strongly with genes that encode essential enzymes in these important pathways. Our results highlight the importance of controlled experiments in linking biogeochemical rates to underlying genetic pathways. Furthermore, they indicate the importance of nitrate as an electron acceptor in fueling microbial respiration, which has consequences for carbon and nitrogen cycling and fate in coastal marine systems.

AB  - To identify relationships between freshwater input and marsh soil properties, measurements of bulk density, nutrients (carbon [C], nitrogen [N], phosphorus [P]), accretion, and accumulation were compared in tidal marshes of three estuaries of Georgia that varied in delivery of freshwater. Soil organic C and N (0-30 cm) were two times greater in marshes of the freshwater-dominated Altamaha River than in the salt marshes of Doboy Sound and Sapelo River. Cs-137 accretion and accumulation of organic C and N were three to five times greater in freshwater-dominated marshes than in salt marshes. The patterns observed in Georgia marshes were geographically general; data for tidal freshwater and brackish marsh soils compiled from 61 studies in the conterminous United States showed lower bulk density and higher percent organic C and N than salt marshes, regardless of geographic region. Salinity, a proxy for freshwater input, was inversely correlated with percent soil organic C and N and with vertical accretion in Georgia marshes and in marshes elsewhere in the conterminous United States. There was no relationship between above- or belowground emergent plant production and salinity of Georgia marshes but the rate of root decomposition was positively related to salinity, and decomposition rate was negatively related to percent soil organic C and C accumulation. In Georgia tidal marshes and elsewhere, soil organic matter content and accumulation are mediated by freshwater through its effects on decomposition.

AB  - The blue carbon paradigm has evolved in recognition of the high carbon storage and sequestration potential of mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. However, fluxes of the potent greenhouse gases CH4 and N2O, and lateral export of carbon are often overlooked within the blue carbon framework. Here, we show that the export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity is approximately 1.7 times higher than burial as a long-term carbon sink in a subtropical mangrove system. Fluxes of methane offset burial by approximately 6%, while the nitrous oxide sink was approximately 0.5% of burial. Export of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon to the coastal zone is also significant and combined may account for an atmospheric carbon sink similar to burial. Our results indicate that the export of DIC and alkalinity results in a long-term atmospheric carbon sink and should be incorporated into the blue carbon paradigm when assessing the role of these habitats in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change.

AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal and estuarine ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Despite the valuable ecosystem services they deliver, tidal marshes have been converted to other land-use types over the past centuries. Although previous studies have reported large decreases in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks after tidal marsh embankment, knowledge on the magnitude and rate of OC losses is still limited. Here, we studied the effect of stepwise embankments of brackish and salt marshes and subsequent marsh progradation on SOC stocks in the Scheldt estuary (the Netherlands). We collected samples from soil profiles along tidal marsh-reclaimed tidal marsh chronosequences and determined total OC stocks and the stable carbon signature of the OC. Our results showed that large losses of previously sequestered SOC occur on a decadal timescale with the embankment of brackish (-8.7 +/- 0.7 kg OC m(-2)) and salt marshes (-6.7 +/- 0.8 kg OC m(-2)). The (incomplete) replacement of tidal marsh OC by agricultural OC is substantially faster in topsoils (ca. a century) compared with subsoils (multiple centuries). Simulations with a coupled land use-SOC model showed that large rates of marsh progradation following embankment construction resulted in a substantial increase in landscape-scale SOC storage, whereas large SOC losses occurred in landscapes dominated by embanked tidal marshes. The findings of our study might help to assess how these management practices affect regional SOC stocks.

AB  - The soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity of salt marshes is of considerable importance with respect to the mitigatiing the potentially detrimental consequences of global climate change. Given that tidal salt marshes are subjected to periodic cycles of inundation, it is assumed that soil C cycle in these marshes is expected to be controlled to varing extent by changes in soil moisture and salinity induced by the alternating patterns of drying and rewetting. In addition, with increases in the extent and severity of nitrogen (N) eutrophication becomes serious, we predicted that soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in tidal salt marshes is likely to be highly responsive to increased N loading. In this study, we conducted a two-factor mesocosm experiment (simulated inundation and N input in a tidal salt marsh) to determine the interactive effects of N eutrophication and inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. Our results showed that increased inundation frequency led to lower levels of CO2 emission but greater CH4 emission, whereas N input weakened the effects of changes in inundation frequency on CO2 and CH4 emissions. Moreover, N input was found to modify CO2 and CH4 emission in response to variations in soil moisture. We also observed an enhancement of soil DOC loss in response to increasing inundation frequency, and that DOC loss in the surface soil was considerably greater than that in subsurface soil. Further, as inundation frequency increased, we detected changes in the relationship between soil DOC and CO2 and CH4. Our findings highlighted that vertical variation in soil moisture induced by inundation is a key factor controlling SOC loss in tidal salt marshes, although N input can weaken this control.

AB  - Mean soil respiration rates (carbon dioxide efflux from bare soils) among salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, RI ranged from 1.7-7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in Spartina patens in high marsh zones and 1.7-6.0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in S. alterniflora in low marsh zones. The soil respiration rates significantly increased along a gradient of increasing watershed nitrogen (N) loads (S. alterniflora, R-2 = 0.95, P = 0.0008; S. patens, R-2 = 0.70, P = 0.02). As the soil respiration increased, the percent carbon (C) and N in the soil surface layer decreased in the S. alterniflora, suggesting that in part, the increased soil respiration rates are contributing to the increased turnover of labile organic matter. In contrast, there were no apparent relationships between the soil respiration rates in the high marsh and the soil C and N contents of the surface layer. However, there was a broad-scale pattern and significant inverse relationship between the high marsh soil respiration rates and the landscape belowground biomass of S. patens. As more and more salt marsh systems are subjected to increasing nutrient loads, decomposition rates of soil organic matter may increase in marsh soils leading to higher turnover rates of C and N.

AB  - Estuarine salt marshes have been recognized as one of the most efficient carbon sinks in the biosphere, with considerable potential for climate change mitigation. However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0-35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production. The further invasion of the S. alterniflora community will exert a positive influence on SOC concentrations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh.

AB  - Saltmarshes provide many valuable ecosystem services including storage of a large amount of 'blue carbon' within their soils. To date, up to 50% of the world's saltmarshes have been lost or severely degraded primarily due to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. Previous efforts have aimed to restore saltmarshes and their ecosystem functions, but the success of these efforts is rarely evaluated. To fill this gap, we used a range of metrics, including organic carbon stocks, root production, soil respiration and microbial communities to compare natural and a 20-year restoration effort in saltmarsh habitats within the Sydney Olympic Park in New South Wales, Australia. We addressed four main questions: (1) Have above- and belowground plant biomass recovered to natural levels? (2) Have organic carbon stocks of soils recovered? (3) Are microbial communities similar between natural and regenerated saltmarshes? and (4) Are microbial communities at both habitats associated to ecosystem characteristics? For both soil organic carbon stocks and belowground biomass, we found no significant differences between natural and regenerated habitats (F-(1,F-14) = 0.47, p = 0.5; F-(1,F-42) = 0.08, p = 0.76). Aboveground biomass was higher in the natural habitat compared to the regenerated habitat (F-(1,F-20) = 27.3, p < 0.0001), which may result from a site-specific effect: protection from erosion offered by a fringing mangrove forest in the natural habitat but not the regenerated habitat. Our microbial community assessment indicated that restored and natural saltmarsh habitats were similar at a phylum level, with the exception of a higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the rhizosphere of saltmarshes from the regenerated habitat (p < 0.01). Abundance of both Desulfuromonas and Geobacter was associated with high carbon and nitrogen densities in soils indicating that these genera may be key for the recovery of ecosystem characteristics in saltmarshes. Our restored and natural saltmarsh soils store at 30 cm depth similar levels of organic carbon: 47.9 Mg OC ha(-1) to 64.6 Mg OC ha(-1). Conservation of urban saltmarshes could be important for 'blue carbon' programmes aimed at mitigating atmospheric carbon dioxide.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes play an important role in mitigating global warming by removing atmospheric carbon at a high rate. We investigated the environmental controls and emergent scaling of major greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in coastal salt marshes by conducting data analytics and empirical modeling. The underlying hypothesis is that the salt marsh GHG fluxes follow emergent scaling relationships with their environmental drivers, leading to parsimonious predictive models. CO2 and CH4 fluxes, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air and soil temperatures, well water level, soil moisture, and porewater pH and salinity were measured during May-October 2013 from four marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuaries, MA, USA. The salt marshes exhibited high CO2 uptake and low CH4 emission, which did not significantly vary with the nitrogen loading gradient -1 (5-126 kg.ha(-1).year ) among the salt marshes. Soil temperature was the strongest driver of both fluxes, representing 2 and 4-5 times higher influence than PAR and salinity, respectively. Well water level, soil moisture, and pH did not have a predictive control on the GHG fluxes, although both fluxes were significantly higher during high tides than low tides. The results were leveraged to develop emergent power law-based parsimonious scaling models to accurately predict the salt marsh GHG fluxes from PAR, soil temperature, and salinity (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency = 0.80-0.91). The scaling models are available as a user-friendly Excel spreadsheet named Coastal Wetland GHG Model to explore scenarios of GHG fluxes in tidal marshes under a changing climate and environment.

AB  - Blue carbon did not originally include macroalgal ecosystems; however evidence is mounting that macroalgal ecosystems function in marine carbon sequestration. The great majority of present day marine macroalgal net primary productivity (NPP) involves haptophytic algae on eroding shores. For these organisms the long-term storage of particulate organic carbon involves export from the site of production of biomass that has evaded parasites and grazers, and that some of the exported biomass is sedimented and stored rather than being mineralized en route by detritivores (microbes and fauna). Export from eroding shores, and subsequent storage, of haptophytic marine macroalgal particulate organic carbon could have started by 1.6 Ga. Storage on depositing shores close to the site of NPP by rhizophytic macroalgae and then by rhizophytic coastal seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves began not less than 209 Ma ago. Future increases in surface ocean temperatures may bring tropical marine macroalgae to their upper temperature limit, while temperate marine macroalgae will migrate poleward, in both cases assuming that temperature increases faster than genetic adaptation to higher temperature. Increased CO2 in the surface ocean will generally favour uncalcified over calcified marine macroalgae. This results in decreased CO2 release from decreased calcification, as well as decreased ballasting by CaCO3 of exported particulate organic carbon resulting in decreasing sedimentation. While much more work is needed, the available information suggests that macroalgae play a significant role in marine organic carbon storage.

AB  - The effects of livestock grazing on grasslands have garnered much attention; however, little is known about how grazing affects ecosystems' ability to simultaneously support multiple ecosystem functions (i.e. ecosystem multifunctionality, hereafter EMF) in coastal salt marshes. To comprehensively evaluate the ecological effects of livestock grazing and tidal flooding on salt marshes, we conducted a grazing-exclusion experiment in the high and middle marsh zones of the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Livestock grazing generally enhanced EMF in the salt marshes, with a stronger impact in the middle marshes than in the high ones. Although plant biomass, above-ground N of plants, soil organic C and sediment deposition rate decreased under grazing, activities of soil microbes and nematodes, soil N pool, N mineralization, decomposition and soil respiration increased. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that tidal flooding and associated replenishment of sediments may mitigate the negative effects of grazing on plants and sedimentation and strengthen positive grazing impacts on nutrient cycling, consequently reinforcing the beneficial effects of livestock grazing on the salt marsh ecosystem multifunctionality. Our results provide a holistic framework of ecosystem-level responses to livestock grazing in salt marshes and highlight the regulatory role of external environmental factors such as tidal flooding. Although livestock grazing enhanced the overall EMF (represents the nutrient cycling rate) of salt marshes in our study, it was not necessarily desirable for ecosystem services. Integration of ecosystem function-multifunctionality and ecosystem service-multifunctionality of salt marshes need to be recommended in future multifunctionality studies.

AB  - Salt marshes, due to their capability to bury soil carbon (C), are potentially important regional C sinks. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades in New England (USA), as well as in some other parts of the world. In this study, we investigated plant biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes at four sites where restoration of tidal flow occurred five to ten years prior to the study. Site elevation, aboveground biomass, CO2 flux, and porewater chemistry were measured in 2015 and 2016 in both restored marshes and adjacent marshes where tidal flow had never been restricted. We found that the elevation in restored marsh sites was 2-16 cm lower than their natural references. Restored marshes where porewater chemistry was similar to the natural reference had greater plant aboveground biomass, gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, as well as net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) than the natural reference, even though they had the same plant species. We also compared respiration rates in aboveground biomass (AR) and soil ( BR) during July 2016, and found that restored marshes had higher AR and BR fluxes than natural references. Our findings indicated that well-restored salt marshes can result in greater plant biomass and NEP, which has the potential to enhance rates of C sequestration at 10-yrs post restoration. Those differences were likely due to lower elevation and greater flooding frequency in the recently restored marshes than the natural marsh. The inverse relationship between elevation and productivity further suggests that, where sea-level rise rate does not surpass the threshold of plant survival, the restoration of these salt marshes may lead to enhanced organic and mineral sedimentation, extending marsh survival under increased sea level, and recouping carbon stocks that were lost during decades of tidal restriction.

AB  - Salt marshes are ubiquitous features of the tidal landscape governed by mutual feedbacks among processes of physical and biological nature. Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall, inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be 0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to sea-level rise (SLR) but are also valued for their potential to provide effective nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Ecological benefits from these ecosystems can be constrained under urban settings by anthropogenic disturbances and pressures, so restoration activities are promoted as a management approach. Here we report on the potential for restoration of disused commercial salt extraction pans to enhance carbon (C) sequestration in the urban Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. We also considered the impact of SLR to 2100 on the distribution of estuarine habitats, the vulnerability of built infrastructure to tidal flooding, and how C sequestration is projected to change over time using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Potential restoration of all salt pans (320 ha) to estuarine habitat was estimated to result in a gain of 67 850 Mg C. Establishing tidal connectivity was investigated as a potential restoration action, but most of the salt pan area was above the elevation of the current tidal range and would require excavation. Although conversion of the salt pans to estuarine habitat was predicted to occur without intervention under SLR, 44% of the original area would remain unchanged. Restoring hydrological connectivity to the estuary for these salt pans would significantly increase the extent of transitional/floodplain marsh, even under SLR to 2100. C sequestration was predicted to be 15% higher (54 614.8 Mg C) by 2100 if the salt pans could be restored, compared to if no action is taken. Overall, restoration of the salt pans has the potential to enhance C sequestration, but SLR will still cause large losses of supratidal marsh due to 'coastal squeeze' and extensive tidal flooding of developed areas by 2100 in the lower reaches of the estuary. A full-scale restoration approach for the Swartkops Estuary could use C sequestration potential to fund the project through carbon offsetting if the revenue exceeds the cost of the restoration activities, but additional social and ecological goals also need to be incorporated if the outcome is to be holistic and beneficial.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are productive environments with high potential for carbon accumulation and storage. Even though organic carbon in salt marsh sediment is typically attributed to plant biomass, it can also be produced by benthic photosynthetic biofilms. These biofilms, generally composed of diatoms and their secretions, are known for their high primary productivity and contribution to the basal food web. The growth of biofilms and the preservation of carbon produced by biofilms depends on the amount of sedimentation; low sedimentation rates will favor decomposition, while high sedimentation rates could decrease biofilm productivity. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to test (1) if biofilms can potentially accumulate carbon in marsh soil and (2) how different sedimentation rates affect the amount of carbon accumulation. Containers filled with a settled mud bed were inoculated with natural biofilms collected from a marsh surface and allowed to grow with favorable light exposure, nutrient supply, and absence of grazing. Mud was added weekly in different amounts, resulting in an equivalent sedimentation rate from 12 to 189 mm/yr After 11 weeks, the sediment columns were sampled and analyzed for ch1 a, organic matter via loss on ignition (LOI), and total organic carbon (TOC). Ch1 a accumulation rates ranged from 123 to 534 mg/cm(2)/yr, organic matter accumulation ranged from 86 to 456 g/m(2)/yr, and TOC accumulation rates ranged from 31 to 211 g/m(2)/yr. These values are on the same order of magnitude of marsh carbon accumulation rates measured in the field. All three metrics (ch1 a, organic matter, and TOC) increased with increased sedimentation rate. These results show that biofilms can potentially contribute to carbon accumulation in salt marsh soils. Furthermore, areas with high sedimentation rates have the potential for higher amounts of organic matter from biofilms in the sediment.

AB  - In a detailed study of the biogeochemical factors affecting the methylation of mercury in a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh, we examined relationships between mercury methylation and numerous variables, including sulfate reduction rates, organic carbon mineralization rates, iron and sulfur chemistry, and the character of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Our data show that salt marshes are important sites of de novo methylmercury (MeHg) production in coastal ecosystems. Some of the controls on MeHg production that have been well-described in other ecosystems also impacted MeHg production in this salt marsh, specifically the effect of sulfide accumulation on mercury bioavailability. We observed some novel biogeochemical relationships with Hg(II)-methylation and MeHg accumulation, particularly the positive association of Hg(II)-methylation with zones of microbial iron reduction. On the basis of this relationship, we suggest caution in wetland and groundwater remediation approaches involving iron additions. Aqueous phase Hg complexation appeared to be the dominant control on Hg bioavailability across the marsh sites examined, rather than Hg partitioning behavior. A detailed examination of DOM character in the marsh suggested a strong positive association between Hg(II)-methylation rate constants and increasing DOM molecular weight. Overall, our results indicate that net MeHg production is controlled by a balance between microbial activity and geochemical effects on mercury bioavailability, but that a significant zone of MeHg production can persist in near surface salt marsh soils. Production of MeHg in coastal marshes may negatively impact ecosystems via export to adjacent estuaries or through direct bioaccumulation in birds, fish and amphibians that feed in these highly productive ecosystems.

AB  - Seagrasses play an important role in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as natural CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. However, global estimates of organic carbon (C-org) stocks, accumulation rates and seafloor elevation rates in seagrasses are limited to a few regions, thus potentially biasing global estimates. Here we assessed the extent of soil C-org stocks and accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Thalassia hemprichii, Enhalus acoroides, Halophila stipulacea, Thalassodendrum ciliatum and Halodule uninervis) from Saudi Arabia. We estimated that seagrasses store 3.4 +/- 0.3 kg C-org m(-2) in 1 m-thick soil deposits, accumulated at 6.8 +/- 1.7 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1) over the last 500 to 2,000 years. The extreme conditions in the Red Sea, such as nutrient limitation reducing seagrass growth rates and high temperature increasing soil respiration rates, may explain their relative low C-org storage compared to temperate meadows. Differences in soil C-org storage among habitats (i.e. location and species composition) are mainly related to the contribution of seagrass detritus to the soil C-org pool, fluxes of C-org from adjacent mangrove and tidal marsh ecosystems into seagrass meadows, and the amount of fine sediment particles. Seagrasses sequester annually around 0.8% of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels by Saudi Arabia, while buffering the impacts of sea level rise. This study contributes data from understudied regions to a growing dataset on seagrass carbon stocks and sequestration rates and further evidences that even small seagrass species store C-org in coastal areas.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to adjacent waters and, consequently, exert a strong influence on the quantity and quality of DOC exported to the coastal oceans. Our understanding of the factors that control the exchange of DOC at the tidal marsh-estuarine interface, however, remains limited. We hypothesize that tidal marsh soils act as a regulator and that their physical characteristics, such as organic carbon content and mineral phase composition, are key controls on DOC exchange between soil surfaces and both surface and interstitial waters. To test this hypothesis, we generated traditional Langmuir sorption isotherms using anaerobic batch incubations of four tidal wetland soils, representing a range of soil organic carbon content (1.77% +/- 0.12% to 36.2% +/- 2.2%) and salinity regimes (freshwater to mixoeuhaline), across four salinity treatments. Results suggest that the maximum soil sorption capacity and DOC binding affinity increase and decrease with greater salinity, respectively, though the enhancement of maximum soil sorption capacity is somewhat mitigated in soils richer in poorly crystalline iron minerals. Initial natively sorbed organic carbon showed a significant positive correlation with soil specific surface area and K showed a moderate yet significant positive correlation with poorly crystalline iron mineral content. Taken together, these results point to a strong mineralogical control on tidal marsh sorption dynamics and a complex physicochemical response of those dynamics to salinity in tidal marsh soils.

AB  - Seasonal variations in food utilisation, particularly storage, by Nereis virens are not well documented. This behaviour often results in carbon sequestration, the extent of which remains unknown. Observations oil food utilisation by Nereis virens were conducted under experimental conditions of controlled temperature, food supply and photoperiod. The amount of ingested and stored food both increase with ration, but the latter does so more rapidly than the former. When food is rare, worms usually prioritise feeding over storing. However, immediate storage is more advantageous than feeding when worms are able to capture extra rations. This strategy is predominant when food is abundant because benefits far outweigh costs. The extrapolation of carbon storage under experimental conditions to natural populations suggests that storage mostly takes place between April and September. Summer storage is likely to be short term because of the predominance of algae, whereas autumn storage is likely to be long term because of vascular plants. The importance of storage on the carbon cycle is difficult to evaluate, but biogeographical distribution and densities of Nereis virens suggest a non-negligible effect.

AB  - Tidal wetlands support plant communities that facilitate carbon storage, accrete soil, and provide habitat for terrestrial and aquatic species. Climate change is likely to alter estuaries through sea-level rise and changing precipitation patterns, although the ecological responses are uncertain. We were interested in plant responses to physiological stress induced by elevated water salinity and flooding conditions, which may be more prevalent under climate change.. We used a greenhouse experiment and factorial flooding (1, 12, 24, and 48 % time) and salinity (0, 5, 15, 30 PSU) treatments to evaluate the productivity responses of three emergent herbaceous species (Carex lyngbyei, Triglochin maritima, and Argentina pacifica) common to tidal marshes of the Pacific Northwest, USA. We measured weekly changes in plant height and final above and belowground biomass for all species after 10 weeks. Increased salinity reduced final above and belowground biomass significantly in all three species, with A. pacifica responding the most, followed by C. lyngbyei and T. maritima. Increased flooding also reduced total biomass in A. pacifica and T. maritima. There was a significant response in C. lyngbyei aboveground biomass and A. pacifica height to the flooding-salinity interaction. These results indicate emergent plant community composition may change in response to novel climate conditions in estuaries, driven by distinct physiological tolerances to salinity and flooding, and highlight the importance of considering multiple climate drivers when projecting ecosystem change. This may be especially true for estuaries that currently have prolonged freshwater phases like those in the Pacific Northwest.

AB  - Potential sulfate reduction and in situ hydrogen sulfide emission rates for three Louisiana marsh soils of varying salinities (salt, brackish, and freshwater) were used to evaluate the influence of soil physicochemical parameters on sulfur transformations in different seasons (summer, winter, and spring). Solid adsorbent preconcentration and emission flux chambers were used in field experiments to measure hydrogen sulfide emissions. Soil redox potential (Eh) was measured at depths between 5 and 50 cm. Duplicate soil cores were obtained and sectioned for laboratory analysis. The fresh and brackish marsh soils were composed predominantly of organic matter, while the salt marsh soils were composed of predominantly minerals. Fresh marsh soils were generally the most oxidized and salt marsh soils the most reduced. In situ hydrogen sulfide emissions, but not potential sulfate reduction rates, were highest for the brackish marsh. Potential sulfate reduction assays may have overestimated in-situ rates, particularly for the more oxidized fresh marsh. Sulfate turnover times were longer in the salt marsh (approximately 40 days) than in either the fresh or the brackish marshes (3-8 days). Tidal action replenishes sulfate less frequently in the fresh and brackish marshes, thus sulfate depletions are more likely. The lowest potential sulfate reduction rates for all marshes occurred in winter. This was attributed to lower temperature and decreased soil sulfate content.

AB  - Coastal margin habitats are globally significant in terms of their capacity to sequester and store carbon, but their continuing decline, due to environmental change and human land use decisions, is reducing their capacity to provide this ecosystem service. In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal salt marsh, one of the blue carbon ecosystems that can adapt and mitigate climate change influence, is drawing global attention due to its high carbon sequestration capability. In China, however, coastal salt marsh has suffered great losses. Nation-wide analysis of salt marsh trends and management is critical to ecosystem protection and restoration. Thus, by analyzing previous coastal salt marsh studies, we found that the extent of coastal salt marsh varied greatly among the Liao River Delta, the Yellow River Delta, the middle coast of Jiangsu Province, Chongming Dongtan and Jiuduansha in Shanghai, with a 59% overall loss of salt marsh extent from the 1980s to the 2010s. The rate of salt marsh loss slowed down after the year 2000. Coastal land-claim (reclamation) is the most dominant driver of salt marsh loss. Climate change and coastal erosion, invasive species, and vegetation dynamics driven by competition and succession have also led to various effects on salt marsh extent and the ecological services they provide. Sea level rise, reclamation pressure and environmental pollution are the main factors, as negative drivers, together with conservation and restoration policies, as positive ones, affecting future trends in salt marshes. China has implemented several measures to protect and restore salt marshes, such as setting up protected areas, drawing marine ecological redline, and making strict regulations on reclamation. However, stronger legal protection for wetlands, more effective enforcement, and participation by local communities can further enhance salt marsh restoration, conservation and management.

AB  - Mangrove sediments from three different mangrove ecosystems (Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in the Godavari Delta, Andhra Pradesh, India, and Galle and Pambala, south-west Sri Lanka) were analysed for their organic carbon content, elemental ratios (C:N) and carbon stable isotope composition. Organic carbon content (0.6 - 31.7% dry weight), C/N ratios (7.0 - 27.3) and delta(13)C (between -29.4 and -20.6parts per thousand) showed a wide range of values. Lower stocks of organic carbon coincided with low C/N (atom) ratios and less negative delta(13)C values, indicating import of marine or estuarine particulate suspended matter. High organic carbon stocks coincided with high C/N ratios and delta(13)C values close, but not equal, to those of the mangrove vegetation. The variations observed in this study and published literature data could be adequately described by a simple two-end mixing model, whereby marine/estuarine suspended matter and mangrove litter were taken as end members. Thus, while in some mangrove ecosystems or vegetation zones, organic carbon stocks can be very high and are almost entirely of mangrove origin, there also appear to be cases in which deposited estuarine or marine suspended matter is the dominant source of organic carbon and nitrogen in mangrove sediments. This situation is remarkably similar to that observed in temperate salt marsh ecosystems where the importance of local vascular plant production to the sediment organic carbon pool is equally variable. The observed high variability in organic matter origin is thought to have a major impact on the overall carbon dynamics in intertidal mangrove ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetland losses in China are globally-relevant issues, as formerly sequestered soil organic carbon is released as CO2 into the atmosphere. Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha(-1)) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves, 175.14 for seagrass, and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30-60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0-20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha(-1)), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)), were 2.26 +/- 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 +/- 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 +/- 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12-123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr(-1). We estimate the average annual emissions of CO2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO2 yr(-1), due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion.

AB  - Carbon (C) storage by vegetated coastal habitats (mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses) is globally recognized as a critical ecosystem service. Research efforts have therefore focused on quantifying C stored in these "blue carbon" ecosystems but a notable knowledge gap still exists for certain geographical regions. This study aimed to provide the first comprehensive assessment of C storage in South African warm temperate mangroves by quantifying the C storage in aboveground biomass and soil C pools associated with the mangrove forest at the Nxaxo Estuary. C storage variability was also related to mangrove forest structure and soil environmental variables. C storage was quantified using standardized protocols for aboveground (live trees, leaf litter, pneumatophores) and soil C pools at five Avicennia marina sites. The results showed soil C storage to be spatially variable while aboveground C pools were similar between intertidal zones within the sites. The soil C pool made the largest contribution to total C storage at each site and ranged from 176.91 +/- 4.5MgC.ha(-1) to 262.53 +/- 18.8 MgC. ha(-1). Of the aboveground carbon pools, live trees made the largest contribution and ranged from 2.25. 1.0 MgC.ha(-1) to 9.56 +/- 3.6 MgC.ha(-1). Across all sites, average C storage for all pools was 234.9 +/- 39.16 MgC.ha(-1), which falls within the range reported for mangroves at other southern hemisphere range limits. Variability in soil C was linearly related to soil organic matter but this relationship was inconsistent between different soil depth intervals that were sampled. Total C storage was inversely related to mangrove tree density. This study confirms the need for more blue carbon studies to quantify C storage in under-represented geographical areas and to investigate factors that drive variability in C storage at different spatial scales.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide important ecological services, habitat, disturbance regulation, water quality improvement, and biodiversity, as well as accumulation and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in vegetation and soil organic matter. Different management practices may alter their capacity to provide these ecosystem services. We examined soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N), C and N pools, C sequestration and N accumulation at four marshes managed with open marsh water management (OMWM) and four marshes that were not at U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) on the East Coast of the United States. Soil properties (bulk density, percent organic C, percent N) exhibited no consistent differences among managed and non-OMWM marshes. Soil organic carbon pools (0-60-cm depth) also did not differ. Managed marshes contained 15.9 kg C/m(2) compared to 16.2 kg C/m(2) in non-OMWM marshes. Proportionately, more C (per unit volume) was stored in surface than in subsurface soils. The rate of C sequestration, based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating of soil cores, ranged from 41 to 152 g/m(2)/year. Because of the low emissions of CH4 from salt marshes relative to freshwater wetlands and the ability to sequester C in soil, protection and restoration of salt marshes can be a vital tool for delivering key ecosystem services, while at the same time, reducing the C footprint associated with managing these wetlands.

AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora has been reported to modify carbon (C) cycling processes and pools of the native salt marsh ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the invasion age and expansion direction of S. alterniflora impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. In this study, by considering the continuous invasion of S. alterniflora into mudflat (seaward) and native species Suaeda salsa (landward) salt marshes over a period of 20 years chronosequence, we quantify their impacts on SOC dynamics along the coastal salt marshes of Yancheng National Nature Reserve of China, based on the extensive field sampling and remote sensing data. The results showed that (1) S. alterniflora invasion increased SOC concentration and density, which averaged 8.39 g C kg(-1) and 0.0085 g C cm(-3) seaward and 6.26 g C kg(-1) and 0.0065 g C cm(-3) landward, respectively; (2) soil organic carbon showed a significantly positive relationship with total nitrogen (TN), salinity, and water content and a negative relationship with pH and bulk density for S. alterniflora landward expansion. For seaward expansion, it showed a similar relationship, but there are higher correlations with soil properties except an insignificant relationship with pH; and (3) soil organic carbon and carbon accumulation rate are significantly higher in seaward than in landward. However, for landward expansion, soil organic carbon concentration keeps increasing linearly with invasion time, while for seaward expansion, it increased to a maximum in 11 years of invasion and then decreased. Our results showed that it is very important to assess the effects of invasion on SOC dynamics in salt marsh ecosystems by considering both the expansion direction and invasion age.

AB  - Crabs and halophytes are important indicators of soil composition and fertility in salt marsh ecosystems. Many previous studies have examined the effects of crab excavation on soil properties, but little is known about the combined effects of crabs and halophytes on salt marsh soils. The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution of halophytes and crabs in a macrotidal salt marsh, and to determine effects of the combination of crabs and halophytes on the physicochemical properties of soils. Vegetation structure and soil properties in relation to seed dispersion distance and habitat type were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Cluster Analysis (CA), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Plant biomass and height of individual marsh plants tended to be higher at distances > 1 m from stands of parent plants. Crabs preferred habitats with high vegetation cover. Low densities of burrowing crabs and halophytes also caused considerable changes in soil properties. The combination of crabs and halophytes increased the spatial variability of physicochemical parameters in these salt marsh soils. Thus these combinations may be important to a complete understanding of plant distribution and soil nutrient cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration aims to restore biodiversity and valuable functions that have been degraded or lost. The Coral Triangle is a hotspot for marine biodiversity held in its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, all of which are in global decline. These coastal ecosystems support valuable fisheries and endangered species, protect shorelines, and are significant carbon stores, functions that have been degraded by coastal development, destructive fishing practices, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration is required to mitigate these damages and losses, but its practice is in its infancy in the region. Here we demonstrate that species diversity can set the trajectory of restoration. In a seagrass restoration experiment in the heart of the Coral Triangle (Sulawesi, Indonesia), plant survival and coverage increased with the number of species transplanted. Our results highlight the positive role biodiversity can play in ecosystem restoration and call for revision of the common restoration practice of establishing a single target species, particularly in regions having high biodiversity. Coastal ecosystems affect human well-being in many important ways, and restoration will become ever more important as conservation efforts cannot keep up with their loss.

AB  - Marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning including seaweed communities - in the territorial waters of the UK and its Overseas Territories are facing unprecedented pressures. Key stressors are changes in ecosystem functioning due to biodiversity loss caused by ocean warming (species replacement and migration, e.g. affecting kelp forests), sea level rise (e.g. loss of habitats including salt marshes), plastic pollution (e.g. entanglement and ingestion), alien species with increasing numbers of alien seaweeds (e.g. outcompeting native species and parasite transmission), overexploitation (e.g. loss of energy supply further up the food web), habitat destruction (e.g. loss of nursery areas for commercially important species) and ocean acidification (e.g. skeletal weakening of ecosystem engineers including coralline algal beds). These stressors are currently affecting biodiversity, and their impact can be projected for the future. All stressors may act alone or in synergy. Marine biodiversity provides crucial goods and services. Climate change and biodiversity loss pose new challenges for legislation. In particular, there are implications of climate change for the designation and management of Marine Protected Areas and natural carbon storage by marine systems to help control the global climate system. The UK currently has legal obligations to protect biodiversity under international and European law.

AB  - In the tidal salt marshes, the spatial variation of soil carbon (C) quality along the vegetation zones is still unclear. Here, a study is conducted in the mudflat, open shrubland, and dense shrubland in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China, and soil organic C (OC) stock, particulate organic matter C (POMC), and aggregate-associated OC in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths are investigated along these vegetation zones. Among the three vegetation zones, dense shrubland had the greatest soil OC stock, open shrubland had the lowest value, and mudflat had an intermediate value. In each soil depth, dense shrubland generally had higher soil OC and POMC concentrations, and POMC/OC ratio compared to mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. Moreover, dense shrubland had a greater proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm in diameter) and OC content in the macro-aggregates than mudflat and open shrubland, respectively. In addition, the OC content in the soil macro-aggregates positively correlated with soil POMC concentration. These results suggest that the high spatial variability in soil OC quantity and quality along the vegetation zones should be incorporated to accurately develop regional C budget in coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, and also imply that a shift in vegetation zones induced by sea level rise could potentially cause substantial changes in the quantity and quality of soil OC in the tidal salt marshes.

AB  - Purpose Soils of tidal marshes play an important role in regional carbon (C) cycles as they are able to store considerable amounts of organic carbon (OC). However, the C dynamics of marsh soils of the Elbe estuary have not been investigated so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sources and distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the factors influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes of the study region.
   Materials and methods In this study, SOC pools were determined in different salinity zones and elevation classes of the estuarine marshes. The amount of initial allochthonous OC was derived from the OC content in fresh sediments. The difference to the recent OC content in the soils was interpreted as autochthonous accumulation or mineralization by microorganisms.
   Results and discussion Young, low marshes of the study sites seem to be predominantly influenced by allochthonous OC deposition whereas the older, high marshes show autochthonous OC accumulation in the topsoils (0-30 cm) and mineralization in the subsoils (30-70 cm). SOC pools of the whole profile depth (0-100 cm) did not significantly differ between elevation classes, but decreased significantly with increasing salinity from 28.3 kg m(-2) in the most upstream site of the oligohaline zone to 9.7 kg m(-2) in the most downstream site of the polyhaline zone. Even though the areal extent of the investigated salinity zones was similar, the SOC mass within 100 cm soil depth decreased from 0.62 Tg (1 Tg = 10(12) g) in the oligohaline zone to 0.18 Tg in the polyhaline zone.
   Conclusions Elevation was found to be one factor influencing the SOC pools of tidal marshes. However, salinity seems to be an even stronger influencing factor reducing the above-ground biomass and, accordingly, the autochthonous OC input as well as the allochthonous input by enhanced mineralization of OC along the course of the estuary. An upstream shift of the salinity zones by sea level rise could, therefore, lead to a reduction of the SOC storage of the estuarine marshes.

AB  - Shrubs are invading into grasslands around the world, but we don't yet know how these shrubs will fare in a warmer future. In ecotonal coastal wetland ecosystems, woody mangroves are encroaching into herbaceous salt marshes owing to changes in temperature, precipitation, and sediment dynamics. Increasing mangrove biomass in wetlands often increases carbon storage, which is high in these productive ecosystems, but little is known about how mangrove growth will change in response to warming. To address this knowledge gap, we deployed warming experiments at three coastal wetland sites along a latitudinal gradient in northeast Florida where Avicennia germinans, black mangroves, are encroaching into salt marshes. We achieved air temperature warming (+1.6 degrees C during the day) at all three sites and measured stem elongation, canopy height and area changes, and leaf and node number. After 2 yr of warming, we found that mangrove growth rate in height increased due to warming. Warming increased stem elongation by 130% over unwarmed control plots after 1 yr at the northern site. Mangrove growth in canopy area did not respond to warming. Site differences in growth rate were pronounced, and mangrove growth in both height and area were lowest at the northern site, despite greater impacts of warming at that site. We also found that area-based relative growth rate was five times higher across all treatments than height-based relative growth rate, indicating that mangroves are growing wider rather than taller in these ecotonal environments. Our findings indicate that the growth effect of experimental warming depends on site characteristics and growth parameter measured. We also propose that differential mangrove growth across the three sites may be driven by biotic factors such as the identity of the salt marsh species into which mangroves are encroaching. Our results suggest that, as seen in other ecosystems, wetland plants may respond most strongly to warming at their poleward range edge.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are productive ecosystems with the capacity to sequester large amounts of carbon (C), but we know relatively little about the impact of climate change on wetland C cycling in lower salinity (oligohaline and tidal freshwater) coastal marshes. In this study we assessed plant production, C cycling and sequestration, and microbial organic matter mineralization at tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marsh sites along the salinity gradient in the Delaware River Estuary over four years. We measured aboveground plant biomass, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange between the marsh and atmosphere, microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in marsh soils, soil biogeochemistry, and C sequestration with radiodating of soils. A simple model was constructed to estimate monthly and annually integrated rates of gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) to carbon dioxide () or methane (), net ecosystem production (NEP), the contribution of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis to ER, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) source or sink status of the wetland for 2 years (2007 and 2008). All three marsh types were highly productive but evidenced different patterns of C sequestration and GHG source/sink status. The contribution of sulfate reduction to total ER increased along the salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to salt marsh. The Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh was a C sink as indicated by both NEP (similar to 140 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and Pb-210 radiodating (336 g C m(-2) year(-1)), a minor sink for atmospheric CH4, and a GHG sink (similar to 620 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The tidal freshwater marsh was a source of CH4 to the atmosphere (similar to 22 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)). There were large interannual differences in plant production and therefore C and GHG source/sink status at the tidal freshwater marsh, though Pb-210 radiodating indicated modest C accretion (110 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline marsh site experienced seasonal saltwater intrusion in the late summer and fall (up to 10 mS cm(-1)) and the Zizania aquatica monoculture at this site responded with sharp declines in biomass and GEP in late summer. Salinity intrusion was also linked to large effluxes of CH4 at the oligohaline site (> 80 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), making this site a significant GHG source (> 2,000 g CO2-eq m(-2) year(-1)). The oligohaline site did not accumulate C over the 2 year study period, though Pb-210 dating indicated long term C accumulation (250 g C m(-2) year(-1)), suggesting seasonal salt-water intrusion can significantly alter C cycling and GHG exchange dynamics in tidal marsh ecosystems.

AB  - On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil platform experienced an explosion which triggered the largest marine oil spill in US history, resulting in the release of similar to 795 million L of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Once oil reached the surface, changes in overall chemical composition occurred due to volatilization of the smaller carbon chain compounds as the oil was transported onshore by winds and currents. In this study, the toxic effects of both fresh and weathered crude oil on denitrification rates of coastal marsh soil were determined using soil samples collected from an unimpacted coastal marsh site proximal to areas that were oiled in Barataria Bay, LA. The 1:10 ratio of crude oil:field moist soil fully coated the soil surface mimicking a heavy oiling scenario. Potential denitrification rates at the 1:10 ratio, for weathered crude oil, were 46 +/- 18.4% of the control immediately after exposure and 62 +/- 8.0% of the control following a two week incubation period, suggesting some adaptation of the denitrifying microbial consortium over time. Denitrification rates of soil exposed to fresh crude oil were 51.5 +/- 5.3% of the control after immediate exposure and significantly lower at 10.9 +/- 1.1% after a 2 week exposure period. Results suggest that fresh crude oil has the potential to more severely impact the important marsh soil process of denitrification following longer term exposure. Future studies should focus on longer-term denitrification as well as changes in the microbial consortia in response to oil exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Approximately half of marine carbon sequestration takes place in coastal wetlands, including tidal marshes, where organic matter contributes to soil elevation and ecosystem persistence in the face of sea-level rise. The long-term viability of marshes and their carbon pools depends, in part, on how the balance between productivity and decay responds to climate change. Here, we report the sensitivity of labile soil organic-matter decay in tidal marshes to seasonal and latitudinal variations in temperature measured over a 3-year period. We find a moderate increase in decay rate at warmer temperatures (3-6% per degrees C, Q(10) = 1.3-1.5). Despite the profound differences between microbial metabolism in wetlands and uplands, our results indicate a strong conservation of temperature sensitivity. Moreover, simple comparisons with organic-matter production suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 and warmer temperatures will accelerate carbon accumulation in marsh soils, and potentially enhance their ability to survive sea-level rise.

AB  - Despite the growing recognition regarding the carbon cycle in the rhizosphere of upland ecosystems, little is known regarding the rhizosphere effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization in tidal marsh soils. In the current study, in situ rhizobox experiments (including rhizosphere and inner and outer bulk soil) were conducted in an estuarine tidal marsh. Our results showed that a higher abundance of total bacteria, Geobacter, dsrA and mcrA and lower a-diversity were observed in the rhizosphere relative to the bulk soil. Rhizosphere effects shifted the partition of terminal metabolic pathways from sulfate reduction in the bulk soil to the co-dominance of microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction in the rhizosphere. Although the rhizosphere effect promoted the rates of three terminal metabolic pathways, it showed greater preference towards microbial Fe(III) reduction in the tidal marsh soils. Plant species had little impact on the partitioning of terminal metabolic pathways, but did affect the potential of total SOC mineralization together with the abundance and diversity of total bacteria. Both the rhizosphere effect and plant species influenced the bacterial community composition in the tidal marsh soils; however, plant species had a less pronounced impact on the bacterial community compared with that of the rhizosphere effect.

AB  - Invasion of Spartina spp. in tidal salt marshes may affect the function and characteristics of the ecosystem. Previous studies reported that the invasion alters biogeochemical and microbial processes in marsh ecosystems, yet our knowledge of changing archaeal community due to the invasion is still limited, whereas archaeal communities play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles within highly reduced marsh soils. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the influences of the Spartina anglica invasion on soil archaeal community and the depth profile of the influences. The relative abundance of archaeal phyla demonstrated that the invasion substantially shifted the characteristics of tidal salt marsh from marine to terrestrial soil only in surface layer, while the influences indirectly propagated to the deeper soil layer. In particular, two archaeal phyla, Asgardaeota and Diapherotrites, were strongly influenced by the invasion, indicating a shift from marine to terrestrial archaeal communities. The shifts in soil characteristics spread to the deeper soil layer that results in indirect propagation of the influences of the invasion down to the deeper soil, which was underestimated in previous studies. The changes in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and salinity were the substantial regulating factors for that. Therefore, changes in biogeochemical and microbial characteristics in the deep soil layer, which is below the root zone of the invasive plant, should be accounted for a more accurate illustration of the consequences of the invasion.

AB  - Coastal areas host some of the planet's most productive ecosystems, providing life-sustaining ecological services and several benefits to humankind, while also being some of the most threatened areas (e.g., by globalization, climate change, and biological invasion). Salt marshes are coastal habitats with a key role in food and shelter provisioning, sediment deposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage. Spartina spp. is a genus of grass halophytes which occurs in salt marshes worldwide, and includes species with different invasive potential. We evaluated the effect of climate change in the distribution and invasion potential of five Spartina species (S. anglica, S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. maritima) at a global scale. Species distribution models (SDMs) were applied on species occurrence data and atmospheric environmental predictors (WorldClim 2.1) to project potential changes in habitat suitability and associated changes in distribution and species co-occurrence until the end of the century, across four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5). Projections showed a global trend for increasing species co-occurrence, with a general range expansion potentiated by increasing pathway severity. This study suggests that Spartina species can potentially benefit from climate change, predicting poleward expansions in the Northern Hemisphere for most species, with results pointing at increased conflict and invasion potential in Northern Europe and East Asian shorelines, already under strong invasive pressure. S. anglica is projected to remain a successful invader, with more severe scenarios likely favoring greater expansions. S. alterniflora exhibits very low expansion comparatively, despite exhibiting the same northward distribution shift. SSP1-2.6 produced the smallest change to species co-occurrence, suggesting a smaller potential for invasion-related conflicts, although still registering a potential net expansion for the Genus. Despite their limitations, SDMs can help establish general trends in climate change ecology and inform policymakers and environmental agents to ensure the correct management of these habitats and, ultimately, ecosystems.

AB  - The denitrification rates of freshwater and oligohaline tidal marsh soils with different textures (loam and sandy soils) in a subtropical estuary, and their responses to nitrogen (N) loading, were investigated. In both marshes, the denitrification rates varied significantly with the season only in loam soil. The denitrification rates were highest in oligohaline marsh loam soil and lowest in freshwater marsh sandy soil. NH4NO3 addition significantly increased the denitrification rates of all the marsh soils. Our findings suggest that soil texture, soil organic matter (OM) content and low-level increases in salinity all had large effects on denitrification, indicating that the dynamics of denitrification rates in estuarine marshes with low-level salinity were controlled by the interaction of salinity and soil texture but mainly depended on OM content. We propose that denitrification in tidal marshes plays an important role in regulating current and future N loading into estuary and inshore coastal waters, especially for tidal freshwater marshes, which introduces great uncertainty into the N dynamics of estuaries under global changes.
   Highlights
   Denitrification rates were higher in loam than sandy soil, independent of salinity.
   Denitrification rates were higher in oligohaline marsh loam than freshwater marsh loam.
   Exogenous N input enhanced denitrification in estuarine marsh soil.
   Loam with high N enhanced N removal, especially in freshwater environments.

AB  - The exotic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the mangrove wetlands in southern China and ecological restoration using native mangroves was conducted in an attempt to control this invasive species. In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0-10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high delta C-13 values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6-62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

AB  - Coastal salt marsh ecosystems contain strong environmental gradients that are anticipated to influence the D/H ratios recorded in the leaf waxes of salt-tolerant plants. We characterized the molecular and hydrogen isotopic composition of alkanes in plant and sediment samples as well as the D/H ratios of environmental and plant waters across an elevation and inundation gradient in a southern Californian, coastal salt marsh. We sampled the dominant salt marsh plant species: Salicornia virginica, Arthrocnemum subterminale and Jamuea carnosa (all succulents), as well as Monanthochloe littoralis and Limonium californicum (nonsucculents). Plant xylem water hydrogen isotopic compositions indicate a shift in source waters from meteoric influences at upland sites (delta D value -20 parts per thousand) to seawater dominated values (0 parts per thousand) at lowland areas. We found leaf water D enrichment relative to xylem water ranging from mean dD values of +54 parts per thousand(upland) to +28 parts per thousand (lowland), interpreted as a reduction of transpiration with increasing inundation time. This has the effect of increasing the net fractionation between source water and leaf wax product across the environmental gradient from mean values of -101 parts per thousand (upland) to -134 parts per thousand (lowland), with an attenuated signal recorded in the dD values of plant leaf wax n-alkanes (-122 parts per thousand to -136 parts per thousand). These results constrain the hydrogen isotopic composition of salt marsh organic matter that may contribute to marine carbon budgets of the Santa Barbara Basin, and further indicate the potential for plant leaf waxes to resolve paleoenvironmental change, including sea level change, in sediment cores from salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments include some of the world's most intact coastal wetlands comprising diverse mangrove, seagrass and tidal marsh ecosystems. Although these ecosystems are highly efficient at storing carbon in marine sediments, their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the potential changes resulting from climate impacts, including sea level rise are not well understood. For the first time, we estimated SOC stocks and their drivers within the range of coastal wetlands of GBR catchments using boosted regression trees (i.e. a machine learning approach and ensemble method for modelling the relationship between response and explanatory variables) and identified the potential changes in future stocks due to sea level rise. We found levels of SOC stocks of mangrove and seagrass meadows have different drivers, with climatic variables such as temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, showing significant contributions in accounting for variation in SOC stocks in mangroves. In contrast, soil type accounted for most of the variability in seagrass meadows. Total SOC stock in the GBR catchments, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, is approximately 137 Tg C, which represents 9%-13% of Australia's total SOC stock while encompassing only 4%-6% of the total extent of Australian coastal wetlands. In a global context, this could represent 0.5%-1.4% of global SOC stock. Our study suggests that landward migration due to projected sea level rise has the potential to enhance carbon accumulation with total carbon gains between 0.16 and 0.46 Tg C and provides an opportunity for future restoration to enhance blue carbon.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has a large area of marshes which play a crucial part in the global carbon cycle. The vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) is a critical indicator of carbon storage of marsh ecosystems. Due to the limitations of field investigation, the spatiotemporal variation of AGB and its influencing factors of the Tibetan Plateau marshes remain unclear. By using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), climate and measured AGB data, this study investigated the temporal and spatial variation of marsh AGB and its response to climate change in the Tibetan Plateau during 2000-2019. The results showed a good correlation between AGB and annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax), and the AGB can be accurately estimated from a power function equation between marshes biomass and NDVImax (Y = 343.08 x NDVImax0.7363). Based on the function equation, we found that AGB density increased significantly (4.10 gmiddotC/m(2)/decade) from 2000 to 2019 over the Tibetan Plateau, with an average value of 184.71 gmiddotC/m(2). In terms of climate effects, increased precipitation in July could significantly increase marsh AGB, while precipitation in other months has no significant effect on the marsh AGB in the Tibetan Plateau. This study first found an asymmetric impact of night and day temperature on AGB in the Tibetan Plateau marshes: warming day-time temperature has no-significant effect on marsh AGB, while night-time warming can significantly increase the AGB of marshes. Considering the background of global asymmetric warming in nighttime and daytime, more attention should be paid to the different impacts of day and night temperatures on marsh AGB in the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Tidal salt marshes provide a range of ecosystem services. The most recently recognized is their provision of highly effective sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, a characteristic they share with mangroves swamps which largely replace salt marshes in the intertidal zones of tropical regions. Efforts are emerging to use salt marsh preservation or restoration in carbon offset programs, similar to the REDD initiative for tropical forests, but a number of issues first must be addressed to determine if a site meets the requirements of these programs. As intertidal systems, both salt marshes and mangrove swamps are threatened by increasing rates of sea level rise, and it will be essential to determine their sustainability, thus meeting the requirement of permanence of the carbon sink. In many areas the vegetation responsible for marsh soil accretion may not survive increased flooding periods, resulting in submergence of the marsh in its present location or inability to restore a marsh at its previous elevation. However, the marsh and its carbon sink, may survive if allowed to migrate inland. Thus assessment of permanence requires a determination if inland migration will be hindered by barriers such as high slopes or development, i.e., if the ecosystem is in a coastal squeeze. Presently, the only technology that can provide elevation models at the required vertical accuracy is Lidar, which also is extremely valuable for assessing vulnerability of coastal communities to flooding. Yet, Lidar data is not available for all coastlines, even those in the developed world. To effectively plan for the future of our coastlines requires Lidar coverage on all sensitive coastlines and its free availability for impact assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt marshes worldwide are faced with threats from rising sea levels and coastal development. We measured changes in salt marsh vegetation structure using remote sensing and its consequences for carbon sequestration, wave attenuation, and sediment trapping ability using remotely sensed imaging, field measurement data, and the published literature data pertaining to the Yangtze Estuary, a rapidly urbanizing area in Eastern China. From 1980 to 2010, the total area of vegetated salt marsh decreased by 17 %, but the vegetation structure changed more dramatically, with the ratio of Phragmites/Spartina/Scirpus changing from 24:0:76, to 77:0:23, 44:13:43, and 33:39:28 in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. Carbon sequestration increased slightly from 1980 to 2010, with the dramatic shifts in plant species composition. The total length of seawall inadequately protected by salt marsh vegetation increased from 44 km in 1980 to 300 km in 2010. Sediment accretion increased (from 8 to 14 million m(3)/year) due to the spread of Spartina, which to some extent compensated the loss of total vegetated area in the salt marsh. Changes in the delivery of functions were not linearly related to the change in the area of vegetated salt marsh, but more from the combined effect of changing vegetation structure, sediment input, and land reclamation. Under threat of sea-level rise, protection and maintenance of vegetation structure outside the seawall are of great importance for the safe economic development inside the seawall.

AB  - In this chapter humic substances (HS) from salt marsh soils are characterized by two spectroscopic techniques single-scan fluorescence and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy The studied soils cover a transitional gradient from predominantly marine to predominantly terrestrial environments a tidal flat vegetated by Spartina maritima (TF) a salt marsh covered by Juncus maritimus (SM) and a grassland in a active polder (GL)
   Differences in the characteristics of the HS from the three soils are detected, which may be attributed not only to the composition of the original organic material but also to environmental factors HS from TF show the lowest degree of humification and a large amount of nonpolar aliphatic components, pointing to a predominant contribution of organic materials from marine and/or microbial sources In the SM soil the suboxic conditions and the high biomass from the vegetation cover led to the accumulation of relatively fresh OM and, consequently, to a low degree of humification of the HS The HS in the GL display the highest degrees of humification and aromaticity, which may have been enhanced by the aeration and drainage of the soil by the reclamation process
   The results indicate that a wide number of factors must be considered in studying organic matter characteristics in salt marshes since they are highly variable systems at both temporal and spatial levels

AB  - The fast growing exotic Sonneratia apetala has been widely used to increase the mangrove area in China. Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.

AB  - In New England salt marshes, man-made earthen barriers, or berms, are generally historic, small-scale (average height = 0.71 m +/- A 0.12 SE; average length = 166 m +/- A 41 SE) tidal restrictions which originated from past agricultural, industrial, and environmental practices. The orientation and size depends primarily on the original purpose of the barrier, but this study examines the effects of berms oriented parallel to the incoming tide such that some landward portion of the marsh receives a different tidal signal than the seaward portion. Our hypotheses considered the impacts of the altered hydrology on pore water chemistry and edaphic characteristics. The results indicate that the effect of berms on salt marsh physical structure varies significantly by site. Where the tidal flooding frequency is restricted and drainage is poor, the landward marsh shows pool development, high salinity and sulfide concentrations, and low vegetation cover. In contrast, where tidal flooding is inhibited but the marsh soils are well-drained, salinity and sulfide concentrations decrease and accelerated decomposition results in subsidence and reduced soil organic matter. Given these findings, impacts from berms may impair salt marsh function and resilience to invasive plants and sea level rise.

AB  - Invasive vegetation species can lead to major changes in the geomorphology of coastal systems. Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.

AB  - We periodically measured soil properties (bulk density, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) in a tidal salt marsh constructed in 1970 over the past five decades (1984, 1995, 1998, 2017) to identify trajectories of soil formation over time. Bulk density was greater in surface (0-10 cm) than subsurface (10-30 cm) soils and decreased with time at a similar rate in both depths. Percent organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) increased with time, with concentrations in surface soils increasing three times faster than subsurface soils. Surface C and N pools (g/m(2), 0-10 cm) exhibited asymptotic trajectories with time, with rapid accumulation in the first two decades that began to equilibrate after 25 years, while subsurface pools of C and N continued to increase in a linear manner. Soil P pools did not exhibit a significant trend related to marsh age. Soil N: P increased in both depths over time, suggesting gradual relaxation of N-limitation of these systems. Our findings can help restoration ecologists identify soil properties, including bulk density, C, N, and C: N suitable for gauging restoration success and better estimate the time frame necessary for recovery of soil-based ecosystem services.

AB  - Tidal salt marsh ecosystems store copious amounts of carbon (C) within sediments. In order to predict how these C stores may be affected by environmental change, it is critical to assess current CO 2 and CH 4 production and efflux from these ecosys- tems. Production and efflux of these greenhouse gases (GHGs) are governed by coupled geochemical, hydrological, physical and biological processes in sediments that are sensitive to local conditions, which can result in large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of GHGs dynamics within the ecosystem. To understand how the drivers of GHGs dynamics vary across salt marsh ecosystems, we coupled solid-phase geochemistry to measurements of porewater chemistry (to-1 m), CO2 and CH4 production in sediments and efflux to the atmosphere in a temperate tidal salt marsh for over one year to capture seasonal patterns within two vegetation zones of the marsh landscape that have distinct biogeochemical and hydrologic conditions: Tall Spartina (TS) and Short Spartina (SS). The SS vegetation zone experienced nearly constant inundation, low redox values (-200 to 200 mV), porewater pH 6-7 that did not vary with depth or time, an enrichment of pyrite and goethite with depth and up to 3 mM porewater sulfide. In contrast, the TS vegetation zone on the natural levee proximal to a tidal channel expe- rienced large water level oscillations due to spring-neap tides that resulted in variable but higher redox values (0-700 mV), porewater pH 6-7 at depth but surface (0-3 cm) as low as 4 in the spring, an enrichment of ferrihydrite and a depletion of pyrite at-30 cm, and up to 0.8 mM ferrous Fe in porewater. At 50-56 cm, solid phase analyses (STXM-NEXAFS) revealed differential C speciation between the two vegetation zones, with stronger C-Fe spatial association at TS and stronger C-Ca co- association at SS despite both having similar soil pH of 3-4. These results suggest that soil pH may not be strongly predictive of C-mineral control in flooded marsh sediments. Both vegetation zones showed consistent CO2 and CH4 emissions from sed- iments to the atmosphere throughout the study period with TS having-60% higher median CO 2 and SS having-55% higher median CH 4 efflux. Using depth profiling, unexpectedly high concentrations of CO 2 (>200 lM) and CH 4 (>200 lM) were observed at depths 50-75 cm at both zones that were higher for SS in these sulfate-rich (up to 17 mM) sediments, which sug- gests methylotrophic methanogenesis occurs deep within the profile of salt marsh sediments away from the tidal channel. Moreover, if we extrapolate our median depth values of CH 4 and CO 2 to the 5.3 Mha of global salt marshes, this could account for a conservative estimate of-70 Gg of unaccounted C stored in gaseous form (i.e., CH 4 and CO 2 ) in marsh sed- iments, which should be considered when attempting to understand the current patterns and future responses of carbon dynamics from these ecosystems.

AB  - Tidal wetland soils exhibit particular physical-chemical properties governed mainly by tidal dynamics. On the Atlantic seaboard of the Iberian Peninsula a great swath of tidal wetlands, which correspond to semi-confined estuaries, represents land reclaimed from the 18th century to the first half of the 20th century and used for urban development or agricultural production. These interventions led to the end of tidal flooding in extensive areas of salt marshes, Causing a drop in the water table that triggered pyrite oxidization processes, leaching of cations and salts and soil acidification. In many cases, these transformations have given rise to environmental problems such as the development of acid sulphate soils, a resulting decrease in pH, and the leaching of carbonates. The organic carbon storage capacity has also been altered, and the release of metal cations from sediments has caused toxic waters to appear.
   In order to investigate the alterations caused by the historic reclamation of estuarine soils on the north coast of Spain, natural and reclaimed lands were mapped in two estuaries (Villaviciosa and San Vicente de la Barquera) and zoned in accordance with flood frequency.
   The different evolutionary paths of the two studied estuarine sites after reclamation can be assessed through the description and analysis of their soils despite reclamation, some parts (i.e. lower areas) of the reclaimed lands do not remain fully isolated from tidal dynamics, whose influence varies throughout the soil profiles that have developed since. The strength of the morphological (e.g. genetic horizons). chemical (pH, metal cation concentration) and functional (balance of the carbon budget) changes suffered by the original soils seem to depend strongly on the remaining tidal influence as well as the land use of the area.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon systems (mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes) are renowned for their efficacy at sequestering large amounts of carbon (C) in sedimentary sinks and effective management action to preserve these C stocks requires an understanding of spatial variability within an estuary. This study analysed 33 coastal blue carbon sediment cores across three subtropical estuaries of Eastern Australia. We measured depth, C content and dry bulk density down the soil profile. Mean C stocks for mangroves, seagrass and saltmarsh, up to a 3 metre depth, were estimated to be 738 +/- 119, 439 +/- 72, and 823 +/- 138 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Linear regression models showed the relationship between distance from ocean and C stocks was significant in mangroves and saltmarsh (p <= 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), with the exception of mangroves in an urbanised estuary which displayed the inverse. The differences we observed in C stocks in mangroves and saltmarsh, not seagrass, in relation to location within the estuary may have important implications for management actions and ecological processes.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including salt marshes, play an important role in the global carbon cycle because of their high-efficiency storage of organic carbon (OC) in soils. Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonous OC (AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2 mainland salt-marsh sites of the European Wadden Sea, analyzing delta C-13 of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoil OC stock. A negative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 salt marshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock. These findings thereby yield important implications for carbon crediting and land-use management.

AB  - A microbial assay and in-source pyrolysis mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate a shift in the characteristics of sestonic particulate organic matter after tidal inundation of a coastal salt marsh in the southwest Netherlands. Analysis of seston samples collected from the main tidal creek of the marsh during a series of tidal cycles showed that an increase in microbial degradability accompanied a more pronounced lipid character of the seston after inundation. No evidence was found that the halophyte vegetation contributed to the efflux of particulate organic matter from the marsh, indicating that the vegetation of the poorly flooded European Atlantic salt marshes may be a minor contributor of particulate organic matter to adjacent bodies of water.

AB  - Analyses of three sediment cores collected from a tidal salt marsh located On the western edge of San Pablo Bay in the San Francisco Bay estuary have produced long-term records of late Holocene marsh development. The records from these cores include a suite of elements, organic carbon content, fossil seeds, pollen, and stable carbon isotopes. The stratigraphy indicates fresher water conditions than present between 3400 and 2000 cal YBP. A tidal marsh became established at China Camp after about 2000 cal YBP: between 2000 cal YBP and approximately 700 cal YBP, conditions in the estuary were apparently more saline and variable. This interval was terminated by at least three or possibly five flood events, as evidenced by coarse elastic materials most likely washed down from the surrounding uplands. These floods represent high rainfall events, possibly El Nino years, and occurred during the late Medieval Climatic Anomaly. Greater plant diversity and pollen from some species with low salt tolerance are found in a core collected near the upland edge of the marsh and date to about 200 years ago, suggesting fresher conditions than today. Over the past 50 years, the diversity of marsh vegetation has decreased, and salt tolerant plants (especially Salicornia virginica) have become the dominant species. These changes are likely a result of the impacts of water diversions and upstream dams in the San Francisco Bay watershed.

AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs), such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows, have the ability to capture and store carbon in the sediment for millennia, and thus have high potential for mitigating global carbon emissions. Carbon sequestration and storage is inherently linked to the geochemical conditions created by a variety of microbial metabolisms, where physical disturbance of sediments may expose previously anoxic sediment layers to oxygen (O-2), which could turn them into carbon sources instead of carbon sinks. Here, we used O-2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and pH microsensors to determine how biogeochemical conditions, and thus aerobic and anaerobic metabolic pathways, vary across mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass sediments (case study from the Sydney area, Australia). We measured the biogeochemical conditions in the top 2.5 cm of surface (0-10 cm depth) and experimentally exposed deep sediments (>50 cm depth) to simulate undisturbed and physically exposed sediments, respectively, and how these conditions may affect carbon cycling processes. Mangrove surface sediment exhibited the highest rates of O-2 consumption and sulfate (SO42-) reduction based on detailed microsensor measurements, with a diffusive O-2 uptake rate of 102 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and estimated sulfate reduction rate of 57 mmol S-tot(2-) m(-2) d(-1). Surface sediments (0-10 cm) across all the VCHs generally had higher O-2 consumption and estimated sulfate reduction rates than deeper layers (> 50 cm depth). O-2 penetration was <4 mm for most sediments and only down to similar to 1 mm depth in mangrove surface sediments, which correlated with a significantly higher percent organic carbon content (%C-org) within sediments originating from mangrove forests as compared to those from seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems. Additionally, pH dropped from 8.2 at the sediment/water interface to <7-7.5 within the first 20 mm of sediment within all ecosystems. Prevailing anoxic conditions, especially in mangrove and seagrass sediments, as well as sediment acidification with depth, likely decreased microbial remineralisation rates of sedimentary carbon. However, physical disturbance of sediments and thereby exposure of deeper sediments to O-2 seemed to stimulate aerobic metabolism in the exposed surface layers, likely reducing carbon stocks in VCHs.

AB  - Most plant production by emergent coastal marshes occurs belowground. This belowground production adds to the accumulation of organic matter sustaining salt marshes as sea level rises, thus preventing excessive flooding, eventual plant death, and habitat loss. The ubiquitous nutrient enrichment of coastal salt marshes stimulating aboveground plant growth may result in higher rates of inorganic matter accumulation that compensates for marsh flooding caused by sea level rise. Results from several short-term experiments, however, demonstrate that root and rhizome biomass and carbon accumulation is reduced with nutrient enrichment, suggesting that eutrophication of coastal waters may not be a compensatory counterbalance to the effects of global sea level rise on salt marshes. We show that the net effects of 36 yr of nutrient enrichment in replicated field experiments do not lead to higher organic or inorganic accumulation. Enrichment reduces organic matter belowground and may result in a significant loss in marsh elevation equivalent to about half the average global sea level rise rates. Sustaining and restoring coastal emergent marshes is more likely if they receive less, not more, nutrient loading.

AB  - A semi-arid mangrove estuary system in the northeast Brazilian coast (Ceara state) was selected for this study to (i) evaluate the impact of shrimp farm nutrient-rich wastewater effluents on the soil geochemistry and organic carbon (OC) storage and (ii) estimate the total amount of OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm). Wastewater-affected mangrove forests were referred to as WAM and undisturbed areas as Non-WAM. Redox conditions and DC content were statistically correlated (P < 0.05) with seasonality and type of land use (WAM vs. Non-WAM). Eh values were from anoxic to oxic conditions in the wet season (from -5 to 68 mV in WAM and from <40 to >400 mV in Non-WAM soils) and significantly higher (from 66 to 411 mV) in the dry season (P < 0.01). OC contents (0-40 cm soil depth) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the wet season than the dry season, and higher in Non-WAM soils than in WAM soils (values of 8.1 and 6.7 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for Non-WAM, and values of 3.8 and 2.9 kg m(-2) in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, for WAM soils; P < 0.01). Iron partitioning was significantly dependent (P < 0.05) on type of land use, with a smaller degree of pyritization and lower Fe-pyrite presence in WAM soils compared to Non-WAM soils. Basal respiration of soil sediments was significantly influenced (P < 0.01) by type of land use with highest CO2 flux rates measured in the WAM soils (mean values of 0.20 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1) C vs. 0.04 mg CO2 h(-1)-g(-1), C). The OC storage reduction in WAM soils was potentially caused (i) by an increase in microbial activity induced by loading of nutrient-rich effluents and (ii) by an increase of strong electron acceptors [e.g., NO3-] that promote a decrease in pyrite concentration and hence a reduction in soil OC burial. The current estimated OC stored in mangrove soils (0-40 cm) in the state of Ceara is approximately 1 million t. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although coastal vegetated ecosystems are widely recognised as important sites of long-term carbon (C) storage, substantial spatial variability exists in quantifications of these 'blue C' stocks. To better understand the factors behind this variability we investigate the relative importance of geomorphic and vegetation attributes to variability in the belowground C stocks of saltmarshes in New South Wales (NSW), southeast Australia. Based on the analysis of over 140 sediment cores, we report mean C stocks in the surface metre of sediments (mean +/- SE = 164.45 +/- 8.74 Mg C ha(-1)) comparable to global datasets. Depth-integrated stocks (0-100 cm) were more than two times higher in fluvial (226.09 +/- 12.37 Mg C ha(-1)) relative to marine (104.54 +/- 7.11) geomorphic sites, but did not vary overall between rush and non-rush vegetation structures. More specifically, sediment grain size was a key predictor of C density, which we attribute to the enhanced C preservation capacity of fine sediments and/or the input of stable allochthonous C to predominantly fine-grained, fluvial sites. Although C density decreased significantly with sediment depth in both geomorphic settings, the importance of deep C varied substantially between study sites. Despite modest spatial coverage, NSW saltmarshes currently hold approximately 1.2 million tonnes of C in the surface metre of sediment, although more C may have been returned to the atmosphere through habitat loss over the past approximately 200 years. Our findings highlight the suitability of using sedimentary classification to predict blue C hotspots for targeted conservation and management activities to reverse this trend.

AB  - BackgroundSalt marshes are major natural repositories of sequestered organic carbon with high burial rates of organic matter, produced by highly productive native flora. Accumulated carbon predominantly exists as lignocellulose which is metabolised by communities of functionally diverse microbes. However, the organisms that orchestrate this process and the enzymatic mechanisms employed that regulate the accumulation, composition and permanence of this carbon stock are not yet known. We applied meta-exo-proteome proteomics and 16S rRNA gene profiling to study lignocellulose decomposition in situ within the surface level sediments of a natural established UK salt marsh.ResultsOur studies revealed a community dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Deltaproteobacteria that drive lignocellulose degradation in the salt marsh. We identify 42 families of lignocellulolytic bacteria of which the most active secretors of carbohydrate-active enzymes were observed to be Prolixibacteracea, Flavobacteriaceae, Cellvibrionaceae, Saccharospirillaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae and Cytophagaceae. These families secreted lignocellulose-active glycoside hydrolase (GH) family enzymes GH3, GH5, GH6, GH9, GH10, GH11, GH13 and GH43 that were associated with degrading Spartina biomass. While fungi were present, we did not detect a lignocellulolytic contribution from fungi which are major contributors to terrestrial lignocellulose deconstruction. Oxidative enzymes such as laccases, peroxidases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases that are important for lignocellulose degradation in the terrestrial environment were present but not abundant, while a notable abundance of putative esterases (such as carbohydrate esterase family 1) associated with decoupling lignin from polysaccharides in lignocellulose was observed.ConclusionsHere, we identify a diverse cohort of previously undefined bacteria that drive lignocellulose degradation in the surface sediments of the salt marsh environment and describe the enzymatic mechanisms they employ to facilitate this process. Our results increase the understanding of the microbial and molecular mechanisms that underpin carbon sequestration from lignocellulose within salt marsh surface sediments in situ and provide insights into the potential enzymatic mechanisms regulating the enrichment of polyphenolics in salt marsh sediments.

AB  - Purpose Sediment organic phosphorus (OP) mineralization plays an important role in phosphorus cycling in coastal salt marshes. However, information on OP mineralization characteristics in sediments under tidal cycles is limited.
   Materials and methods Sediment cores were collected from salt marshes which were exposed to tidal cycles. A laboratory manipulation experiment was conducted under simulated tidal flooding cycles. After the completion of each incubation experiment, the inorganic phosphorus (IP) and OP fractions were analyzed and net phosphorus mineralization rates were calculated to investigate the sediment OP mineralization process. Sediment microbial characteristic and chemical properties were determined to identify factors that affect the mineralization of OP in the Yellow River Delta.
   Results and discussion During the first 2 days of incubation, the tidal cycles significantly increased the microbial biomass in the sediments, which accelerated the assimilation of IP by microorganisms and the transformation of IP into OP in their bodies, thereby causing a significant increase in OP in the sediments. After 2 days of incubation, the mineralization and immobilization of OP entered the adaptation stage and gradually reached the dynamic balance of various phosphorus fractions in sediments. The path analysis showed that microbial biomass phosphorus and carbon (MBP and MBC) and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) are the direct factors influencing OP mineralization in sediments. The indirect effects of soil organic matter (SOM), water content (WC), exchangeable aluminum (Al-0), and exchangeable iron (Fe-0) on net phosphorus mineralization rate were relatively high.
   Conclusions In the laboratory experiments, we showed that the recovery of tidal cycles caused a fluctuation in OP mineralization and immobilization in sediments, which reached equilibrium over time. The tidal effect was conducive to maintaining the stability of phosphorus in sediments of coastal salt marshes. The findings of this study can contribute to protecting water quality and improving primary productivity in coastal salt marshes by regulating the tidal cycles and the key environmental factors (e.g., SOM, WC, Al-0, and Fe-0) influencing OP mineralization.

AB  - Denitrification is an important process for removing nitrogen in wetlands, and it is influenced by many environmental factors. However, little information is available on the relationship between hydrologic conditions and denitrification. In this study three typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including short-term flooding wetlands (STFW), seasonal-flooding wetlands (SFW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) were chosen as the study sites in the Yellow River Delta. In contrast, five typical sampling sites with different flooding frequencies, including 100-year floodplain (H), 10-year floodplain (T), 5-year floodplain (F), 1-year floodplain (O) and permanently flooded floodplain (B) were chosen as the study sites in Xianghai wetlands. This study reflected that the denitrification rates decreased with depth along soil profiles in both inland and coastal salt marsh soils. Flooding periods, soil depth and their interaction showed significant effects on the denitrification processes. Generally, higher flooding frequencies will cause higher denitrification rates in salt marshes. Moreover, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with soil moisture content in both wetlands. Additionally, the denitrification rates were significantly positively correlated with organic matter and NO3--N content while negatively correlated with soil pH and salinity in inland salt marshes. Therefore, the changes in soil properties (e.g. SOM, TN, pH and salinity) can become an important way to control NO3- levels in inland salt marshes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Blue carbon" ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows, have large stocks of organic carbon (Corg) in their soils. These carbon stocks are vulnerable to decomposition and - if degraded - can be released to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. We present a framework to help assess the relative risk of CO2 emissions from degraded soils, thereby supporting inclusion of soil Corg into blue carbon projects and establishing a means to prioritize management for their carbon values. Assessing the risk of CO2 emissions after various kinds of disturbances can be accomplished through knowledge of both the size of the soil Corg stock at a site and the likelihood that the soil Corg will decompose to CO2.

AB  - We have characterized the molecular and genomic diversity of the microbiota of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian model for comparative developmental and functional biology and a year-round inhabitant of temperate salt marshes. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed four ribotypes associated with N. vectensis at multiple locations and times. These associates include two novel ribotypes within the E-Proteobacterial order Campylobacterales and the Spirochetes, respectively, each sharing <85% identity with cultivated strains, and two gamma-Proteobacterial ribotypes sharing >99% 16S rRNA identity with Endozoicomonas elysicola and Pseudomonas oleovorans, respectively. Species-specific PCR revealed that these populations persisted in N. vectensis asexually propagated under laboratory conditions. cDNA indicated expression of the Campylobacterales and Endozoicomonas 16S rRNA in anemones from Sippewissett Marsh, MA. A collection of bacteria from laboratory raised N. vectensis was dominated by isolates from P. oleovorans and Rhizobium radiobacter. Isolates from field-collected anemones revealed an association with Limnobacter and Stappia isolates. Genomic DNA sequencing was carried out on 10 cultured bacterial isolates representing field- and laboratory-associates, i.e., Limnobacter spp., Stappia spp., P. oleovorans and R. radiobacter. Genomes contained multiple genes identified as virulence (host-association) factors while S. stellulata and L. thiooxidans genomes revealed pathways for mixotrophic sulfur oxidation. A pilot metatranscriptome of laboratory-raised N. vectensis was compared to the isolate genomes and indicated expression of ORFs from L. thiooxidans with predicted functions of motility, nutrient scavenging (Fe and P), polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis for carbon storage, and selective permeability (porins). We hypothesize that such activities may mediate acclimation and persistence of bacteria in a N. vectensis holobiont defined by both internal and external gradients of chemicals and nutrients in a dynamic coastal habitat.

AB  - The atmospheric burden of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) is still considerable due to its long atmospheric lifetime, although CH3CCl3 emissions have declined considerably since it was included into the Montreal Protocol. Moreover, CH3CCl3 emissions are used to estimate hydroxyl radical (OH) levels, trends, and hemispheric distributions, and thus the mass balance of the trace gas in the atmosphere is critical for characterizing OH concentrations. Salt marshes may be a potential sink for CH3CCl3 due to its anoxic environment and abundant organic matter in sediments. In this study, seasonal dynamics of CH3CCl3 fluxes were measured using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the gas flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally harvested and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.
   Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally acted as a net sink of CH3CCl3 in the growing season (from April to October). The flux of CH3CCl3 ranged between -3.38 and -32.03 nmol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rate occurred at the cordgrass marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of CH3CCl3. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated marsh was a minor source of CH3CCl3 when soil was frozen, the emission rate ranging from 3.43 to 7.77 nmol m(-2) d(-1.) However, the mudflat was a minor sink of CH3CCl3 whether it was frozen or not in the non-growing season. Overall, the coastal salt marsh in eastern China was a large sink for the gas, because the magnitude of consumption rate was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analysis showed that the direction and magnitude of the effect of higher plants on the flux of CH3CCl3 depended on timing of sampling vegetation type. In the growing season the plant biomass decreased the gas flux and acted as a large sink of the gas, whereas it presented as a minor source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism underlying plant uptake process is not clear. The CH3CCl3 flux was positively related to the dissolved salt concentration and organic matter content in soil, as well as light intensity, but it was negatively related to soil temperature, sulfate concentrations, and initial ambient atmospheric concentrations of CH3CCl3.

AB  - Increases in temperature are expected to facilitate encroachment of tropical mangrove forests into temperate salt marshes, yet the effects on ecosystem services are understudied. Our work was conducted along a mangrove expansion front in Louisiana (USA), an area where coastal wetlands are in rapid decline due to compounding factors, including reduced sediment supply, rising sea level, and subsidence. Marsh and mangrove ecosystems are each known for their ability to adjust to sea-level rise and support numerous ecosystem services, but there are some differences in the societal benefits they provide. Here, we compare carbon and nitrogen stocks and relate these findings to the expected effects of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen filtration and carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands. We specifically evaluate the implications of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) encroachment intoSpartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh. Our results indicate that black mangrove encroachment will lead to increased aboveground carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, we found no differences in belowground (that is, root and sediment) nitrogen or carbon stocks between marshes and mangroves. Thus, the shift from marsh to mangrove may provide decadal-scale increases in aboveground nitrogen and carbon sequestration, but belowground nitrogen and carbon sequestration (that is, carbon burial) may not be affected. We measured lower pore water nitrogen content beneath growing mangroves, which we postulate may be due to greater nitrogen uptake and storage in mangrove aboveground compartments compared to marshes. However, further studies are needed to better characterize the implications of mangrove encroachment on nitrogen cycling, storage, and export to the coastal ocean.

AB  - Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems that play an important role in carbon fixing. The amount of carbon fixed by temperate brackish marshes depends, among others, on the biomass produced, its decomposition and the organic carbon stored in the soil. Here, we assumed that the functional trait composition of the vegetation both responded to environmental drivers and affected production, decomposition rate of native biomass and soil organic carbon, in addition to direct links between environmental drivers and these ecosystem properties. We tested a set of detailed hypotheses with a partial least squares structural equation model and quantified wave height, inundation period, salinity, soil nutrients, species abundances and as traits the leaf area, specific leaf area, stem bending properties and investment per plant organ, as well as above-ground standing biomass, decomposition rates of native and control biomass (hay) and soil organic carbon (SOC). There was no direct relationship between environmental drivers and ecosystem properties, except with the decomposition of control hay. All other linkages involved the functional composition of the vegetation. Increasing inundation period simultaneously decreased plants traits like stem stiffness, leaf area, specific leaf area and mass fraction of stems and leaves, which were aggregated in a new trait 'aboveground module'. Total plant biomass decreased in communities on higher elevations with reduced wave height. Here, increased investment in the aboveground trait module resulted in higher aboveground community biomass and SOC but decreased the decomposition of native plant material, which in turn was higher in the low lying vegetation zones. Increasing total plant biomass also increased SOC, but not aboveground community biomass. Both the aboveground trait module and total plant biomass were response and effect traits, by responding to the environmental drivers and affecting carbon related ecosystem properties. At lower elevation with higher inundation and higher wave height, SOC was lower than the product of standing biomass and decomposition rate, which could be a proxy of the expected SOC. This may indicate an export of dead plant material to higher elevations or further downstream. Due to sea level rise, the area of estuarine vegetation may decrease because a fixed dike line along the river prevents landward migration, which can reduce the amount of biomass produced and with it the potential to store SOC. Restoration of the tidal marshes or realignment of the dikes may be necessary to protect the ecosystem properties and services of estuarine vegetation.

AB  - Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.

AB  - The exotic smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has invaded intertidal wetlands near the Ronggenshan tidal flats of Beihai, Guangxi, China, where historically seagrasses and mangroves coexisted. We investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) storage and macrobenthic community structure in the existing mangroves (MG), S. alterniflora (SA), seagrass bed (SG), and unvegetated flat (UnV) habitats following the S. alterniflora invasion. SOC storage increased after S. alternifolia invasion in the SG and UnV habitats. Spartina alterniflora invasion changed the dominant species of the macrobenthos in the original habitats and reduced the diversity of macrobenthos in SG and UnV habitats. Clearly, S. alternifolia invasion can change the ecological functioning of south China's coastal ecosystems by altering carbon sequestration and affecting biodiversity.

AB  - Mitigation of increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by plants may be more efficient in saline systems with soils lower in organic matter than in other freshwater systems. In saline systems, decomposition rates may be lower and potential soil carbon storage higher than in fresh water systems. The effects of salinity, plant species and time on CO2 surface flux and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) leached during irrigation were determined in the laboratory in microcosms containing sand amended with residues of two halophytes, Atriplex nummularia and Salicornia bigelovii, and one glycophyte, Triticum aestivum. Surface flux of CO2 and DOC leached during decomposition were monitored for 133 days at 24 degrees C in microcosms containing different plant residue (5% w/w). Microcosms were irrigated every 14 days with distilled water or seawater adjusted to 10, 20, or 40 g L(-1) salts. CO2 flux and DOC leached were significantly higher from microcosms amended with A. nummularia residue compared to S. bigelovii or T. aestivum at all salinities and decreased significantly over time for all plant species. Irrigating with water of high salinity, 40 g L(-1), compared to distilled water resulted in a decrease in CO2 surface Aux and DOC in leachate, but differences were not significant at all sampling dates. Results indicate that plant residue composition, as well as increased salinity, affect CO2 surface flux and DOC in leachate during plant residue decomposition and may be an important consideration for C storage in saline systems.

AB  - Although coastal marshes are net carbon sinks, they are net methane sources. Aerobic methanotrophs in coastal marsh soils are important methane consumers, but their activity and populations are poorly characterized. DNA stable-isotope probing followed by sequencing was used to determine how active methanotrophic populations differed in the main habitats of a Chinese coastal marsh. These habitats included mudflat, native plant-dominated, and alien plant-dominated habitats. Methylococcaceae was the most active methanotroph family across four habitats. Abundant methylotroph sequences, including methanotrophs and non-methane-oxidizing methylotrophs (Methylotenera and Methylophaga), constituted 50-70% of the 16S rRNA genes detected in the labeled native plant-dominated and mudflat soils. Methylotrophs were less abundant (20%) in labeled alien plant-dominated soil, suggesting less methane assimilation into the target community or a different extent of carbon cross-feeding. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated a significant correlation between the active bacterial communities and soil properties (salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and available phosphorus). Importantly, these results highlight how changing vegetation or soil features in coastal marshes may change their resident active methanotrophic populations, which will further influence methane cycling.

AB  - As an exotic plant species, Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem function in Chinese coastal regions. Unveiling the dynamics of soil bacteria community during its invasion is essential for a better understanding of related biogeochemical processes, while the shift in soil bacterial community over invasive time remains unclear. A short-term chronosequence was identified to assess the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil nutrients and bacterial community composition and structure (using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing) over the time of invasion (i.e., (1) at least 10 years, (2) nearly 5 years, (3) less than 2 years, and (4) in native salt marshes or 0 years) in the Yellow River Estuary. The results exhibited an orderly change in the soil physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition over the invasion time. Soil pH showed a significant decrease with the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM), whereas soil nutrients such as soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), K+, and Mg2+ were generally increased with the age of the invasion. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs, 97% similarity level) exhibited a decreasing trend, which suggested a decline in bacterial diversity with the invasion age. The dominant groups at the phylum level were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes (the sum of relative abundance was > 70% across all samples). The relative abundances of Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes steadily decreased, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with the plant invasion. The distribution pattern of the soil bacteria was clearly separated according to the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) in native and invaded salt marshes. The variation in the soil bacterial community was tightly associated with the soil physicochemical properties (Mantel test, P < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that plant traits explained 4.95% of the bacterial community variation, and soil variables explained approximately 26.96% of the variation. Network analysis also revealed that plant invasion strengthens the interaction among soil bacterial communities. Overall, our findings highlight the bacterial community succession during the Spartina alterniflora invasion in coastal salt marsh soils, which can provide insight regarding the association between soil development and invasive plant.

AB  - The occurrence of mining areas in the vicinities of salt marshes may affect their ecological functions and facilitate the transfer of pollutants into the food chain. The mobilisation of metals in salt marsh soils is controlled by abiotic (pH, redox potential) and biotic (influence of rhizosphere) factors. The effect of the rhizosphere of two plant species (Sarcocornia fruticosa and Phragmites australis) and different flooding regimes on potentially harmful metals and As mobilisation from salt marsh soil polluted by mining activities were investigated (total concentrations: 536 mg kg(-1) As, 37 mg kg(-1) Cd, 6746 mg kg(-1) Pb, 15,320 mg kg(-1) Zn). The results show that the changes in redox conditions (from 300 mV to -100 mV) and pH after flooding and rewetting periods may mobilise the contaminant elements into soil solution (e.g., 100 mu g L-1 Cd, 30 mu g L-1 Pb, 7 mg L-1 Zn), where they are available for plants or may be leached from the soil. Drying periods generated peaks of concentrations in the soil solution (up to 120 mu g L-1 Cd and 50 mu g L-1 Pb). The risk assessment of As and metal-polluted salt marshes should take into account flood dynamics in order to prevent metal(loid) mobilisation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil nitrogen pools were lower in a 4-yr-old constructed salt marsh than in an adjacent natural marsh of San Diego Bay.  Aboveground biomass and foliar nitrogen content of Spartina foliosa were both lower for the constructed marsh.  Soil organic carbon, which was highly positively correlated with total nitrogen, was also lower in theconstructed marsh. Rates of nitrogen fixation were higher for the natural marsh in surface soils (1 cm depth) but not in the rhizosphere (10 cm depth).  Experimental additions of organic matter increased rates of nitrogen fixation substantially for both the constructed and natural marsh soils, with glucose stimulating greater increases than Spartina foliosa detritus (roots and rhizomes).  In comparison with natural marshes studied elsewhere, the San Diego Bay sites have low nitrogen pools and little soil organic carbon.  Nitrogen mineralization rates (in situ incubations) were high in both marshes studied.  The low nitrogen pools reflect low tidal import and infrequent streamflow influxes and, possibly, high nitrogen demands of vegetation stressed by hypersaline soils.

AB  - We examined patterns of habitat function (plant species richness), productivity (plant aboveground biomass and total C), and nutrient stocks (N and P in aboveground plant biomass and soil) in tidal marshes of the Satilla, Altamaha, and Ogeechee Estuaries in Georgia, USA. We worked at two sites within each salinity zone (fresh, brackish, and saline) in each estuary, sampling a transect from the creekbank to the marsh platform. In total, 110 plant species were found. Site-scale and plot-scale species richness decreased from fresh to saline sites. Standing crop biomass and total carbon stocks were greatest at brackish sites, followed by freshwater then saline sites. Nitrogen stocks in plants and soil decreased across sites as salinity increased, while phosphorus stocks did not differ between fresh and brackish sites but were lowest at salty sites. These results generally support past speculation about ecosystem change across the estuarine gradient, emphasizing that ecosystem function in tidal wetlands changes sharply across the relatively short horizontal distance of the estuary. Changes in plant distribution patterns driven by global changes such as sea level rise, changing climates, or fresh water withdrawal are likely to have strong impacts on a variety of wetland functions and services.

AB  - Across the globe, species distributions are changing in response to climate change and land use change. In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of A. germinans at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events. Coastal scientists in the southeastern United States can use the identified allometric equations, in combination with easily obtained and non-destructive plant volume measurements, to better quantify and monitor ecological change within the dynamic, climate sensitive, and highly-productive mangrove-marsh ecotone.

AB  - The wetlands play an important role in carbon storage, especially at high latitudes, at which they store nearly one-third of global soil carbons. However, few studies have investigated the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the long-term, especially effects of freeze-thaw cycles on these gases emissions in freshwater marsh ecosystems. In this paper, we collected greenhouse gas emission data from a freshwater marsh area in China for 4 years, evaluated their release variables and speculated on their potential atmospheric impact. For this paper, we report on the CO2, CH4 and NO emission rates recorded from June 2002 to November 2005 in the Sanjiang Plain of northeast China. We measured their interannual variations and fluctuations, as well as factors affecting their emissions, and estimated their regulation and freeze-thaw cycle impacts. Our results revealed obvious CO2 and CH4 emission fluctuations during the winter months, and during the freeze-thaw cycle, and a strong interannual variation during the growing season. Overall, we documented a close relationship between the CO2 and CH4 emissions, implicating some regulatory commonality. We determined that the marsh was a N2O sink during the winter, but a significant source of NO during the freeze-thaw cycle as the temperature increased, especially in early summer. During the thaw-freeze period, the N2O levels were positively correlated with the water depth. Additionally, water depth greatly governed the interannual variation of the N2O emissions from the marshes during the thaw-freeze period. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations and fluxes are limited in coastal regions in the eastern U.S. In this study, continuous and high temporal resolution measurements (5s) of atmospheric NH3 concentrations were recorded using a cavity ring-down spectrometer in a temperate tidal salt marsh at the St Jones Reserve (Dover, DE). Micrometeorological variables were measured using an eddy covariance system which is part of the AmeriFlux network (US-StJ). Soil, plant, and water chemistry were also analyzed to characterize the sources and sinks of atmospheric NH3. A new analytical methodology was used to estimate the average ecosystem-scale diurnal cycle of NH3 fluxes by replicating the characteristics of a chamber experiment. This virtual chamber approach estimates positive surface fluxes in continuing strongly stable conditions when mixing with the air above is minimal. Our findings show that tidal water level may have a significant impact on NH3 emissions from the marsh. The largest fluxes were observed at low tide when more soil was exposed. While it is expected that NH3 fluxes will peak when the air temperature maximizes, high tide occurred concurrently with midday peaks in solar irradiance led to a decrease in NH3 fluxes. Furthermore, soil, plant, and water chemistry measurements underpinning the NH3 concentrations and fluxes lead us to conclude that this coastal wetland ecosystem can act as either a sink or a source of NH3. Such measurements provide novel data on which we can base reliable parameterizations to simulate NH3 emissions from coastal salt marsh ecosystems using surface-atmosphere transfer models.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands such as salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses provide a natural environment for the sequestration and long-term storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. As a fertilizer, nitrogen (N) increases the vegetative growth and thus more CO2 may be fixed in plants as biomass representing the short-term storage pool of carbon, therefore reducing its atmospheric level. Salt marshes, in particular, have been identified as being highly effective at carbon sequestration as well as adsorbing and transforming N. However, there are limited atmospheric measurements of ammonia (NH3) concentrations and exchanges in coastal areas of the Eastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. This pilot study represents one of the few atmospheric measurements of NH3 over temperate tidal salt marshes in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. The high temporal resolution measurements of NH3 concentrations indicated that local sources, such as agriculture and industry, may have a considerable impact on the local atmospheric NH3 concentrations. The results also show that tidal water levels in salt marshes may have a significant effect on NH3 emissions.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (OC) is sensitive to climatic change, and it can be expected to manifest measurable responses to global warming. Globally, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common nutrients limiting plant growth and soil carbon storage. We collected soil samples at 17 marsh sites in August 2012 across Northeast China. These samples were analysed for variations in soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels, and multiple controlling of environmental and biotic factors. Results showed the means to be as follows: 16,850.7 mmol kg(-1) (OC), 540.5 mmol kg(-1) (TN), 30.0 mmol kg(-1) (TP), 29.9 (C:N), 516.5 (C:P) and 16.8 (N:P). The OC, TN, TP and C:N:P ratios decreased with increases in the mean annual temperature (MAT) and flooding depth, whereas the C:N ratio did not change significantly with the flooding depth. Quadratic relationships were observed between the OC, TN and TP and soil pH. Linear mixed-effect models showed that climate exerted great influences on soil nutrients. These results will improve our understanding of the ecological patterns of nutrient fluxes and the biogeochemical mechanisms of the response of vegetation to climate changes.

AB  - Temperate tidal salt marshes are an important carbon sink. They store 44.7 Tg C and only emit low amounts of greenhouse gases. Although recent studies have suggested that environmental changes such as eutrophication and plant invasion may alter their methane and nitrous oxide emissions, the exact consequences and dynamics are not yet fully understood. We hypothesize that the greenhouse gas emission responses from nitrogen addition differs depending on halophyte types. In this study, we conducted soil incubation experiments with different halophyte and nitrogen amendments. We found that nitrogen addition significantly enhanced methane emissions from bare tidal flats (45%) and Suaeda japonica marshes (3500%), which normally have low plant biomass nitrogen input. The main contributors to this change were the increased abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and decreased relative abundance of sulfate to methanogen reducers (dsrA/mcrA). These results suggest that the effects of nitrogen addition on methane emission stimulation may be substantial for specific types of tidal marshes. They further suggests that improper nitrogen input management and the consequent eutrophication may cause a dramatic rise in methane emissions.

AB  - Estuaries are sinks of materials and substances which are released directly into them or transported from rivers that drain the basin. It is usual to find high organic matter loads and fine particles in the sediments. We analyzed radionuclide concentrations ((210)po, Th-230, Th-232, U-234, U-238, Ra-226, Th-228, Ra-228, K-40) in sediments and three different organs (roots, stems and leaves) of three species of halophytes plants (Spartina maritima, Spartina densiflora and Sarcocornia perennis). The study was carried out in two tidal salt marshes, one polluted by U-series radionuclides and another nearby that was unpolluted and was used as a control (or reference) area. The Tinto River salt marsh shows high levels of U-series radionuclides coming from mining and industrial discharges. On the contrary, the unperturbed Piedras River salt marsh is located about 25 km from the Tinto marsh, and shows little presence of contaminants and radionuclides. The results of this work have shown that natural radionuclide concentrations (specially the U-isotopes) in the Tinto salt marsh sediments are one order of magnitude higher than those in the Piedras marsh. These radionuclide enhancements are reflected in the different organs of the plants, which have similar concentration increases as the sediments where they have grown. Finally, the transfer factor (IT) of the most polluted radionuclides (U-isotopes and Po-210) in the Tinto area are one order of magnitude higher than in the Piedras area, indicating that the fraction of each radionuclide in the sediment originating from the pollution is more available for the plants than the indigenous fraction. This means that the plants of the salt marshes are unhelpful as bioindicators or for the phytoremediation of radionuclides. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marsh soil accretion processes were examined at 12 locations in fresh and brackish marshes in Louisiana's northern Barataria Basin estuary. Soil accretion rate determined from Cs-137 ranged from 0.59 to 1.03 cm yr(-1). Soil structure and accretion were controlled primarily by organic matter accumulation rather than mineral sediment deposition with water and entrapped gases occupying the majority of the soil volume ranging from 92 to 95%. Organic matter accumulation ranged from 328 to 580 g m(-2) yr(-1) while mineral accumulation ranged from 78 to 380 g M-2 yr(-1) Such organic-based fresh and brackish marsh soil are more fragile than mineral based marsh soils and are subject to impact by salt water intrusion and hurricane storm surge forces. The Davis Pond diversion is a conduit between the Mississippi River and the coastal marshes of Barataria basin currently reintroducing river water into the basin leading to lower basin salinities This hydrologic management measure should benefit and extend the stability of the studied marsh sites encouraging continued vegetation growth and soil organic matter accumulation. Accrual of organic matter is necessary to prevent drowning of the marsh which is subject to both the global eustatic sea level rise (1-2 mm yr(-1)) and significant local subsidence (similar to 10 mm yr(-1)). This high rate of relative sea level rise can lead to open water/ponding and subsequent erosion of the surrounding marsh due to flooding and salinity stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The introduction of Phragmites australis is known to substantially increase methane emission in the tidal salt marsh. Previous studies suggested that enhanced carbon input by the introduction may stimulate methanogenic activity. However, the exact mechanisms and the effects of the introduction of P. australis to methane dynamics in the deep soil layer are still unclear. In this study we collected 1 m deep intact soil cores and gas samples at native Suaeda japonica- and P. australis-vegetated temperate tidal salt marshes in Suncheon Bay, Republic of Korea. Rates of methane emission and vertical distribution of soil biogeochemistry and microbial communities were analyzed to understand the relationship among chemical and microbiological properties. The introduction of P. australis significantly enhanced methane emission in sites, which was caused by increased DOC and reduced competitive inhibition between sulfate reducer and methanogens. In particular, reduced competitive inhibition between sulfate reducers and methanogens in deep soil layer may play a substantial role in the enhanced methane emission by the introduction of P. australis. Potential methane production was also significantly higher in deeper soil layers than the surface soil layer. We suggest that deep soil layer plays a critical role in the methane dynamics of tidal salt marsh which is introduced by deep root plants, such as P. australis.

AB  - Salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, and play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Net carbon dioxide (CO2) ecosystem exchanges in coastal salt marshes remain poorly investigated. In Spartina alterniflora dominated North American Atlantic coast marshes, the lack of a clear understanding of how Spartina alterniflora responds to flooding limits our current ability to understand and predict salt marsh response to sea-level rise. Here we investigate the processes influencing ecosystem-level carbon exchanges between a S. alterniflora dominated salt marsh on the eastern shore of Virginia and the atmosphere. We examined the impacts of tidal inundation on the marsh-atmosphere carbon exchanges through a combination of eddy covariance measurements and in situ photosynthetic measurements. Maximum daytime carbon fluxes were observed during the middle of the growing season (July and August) and amounted to - 10 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the marsh assimilated 130 gC m(-2) during the 2007 growing season. Our study is the first to quantify the effects of tidal inundation on marsh plants, which caused anywhere from 3% to 91% reductions in atmospheric carbon fluxes, with a mean reduction of 46 +/- 26%, when compared to non-flooded conditions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems globally but have experienced dramatic degradation and loss within the past several decades. Vegetation biomass of coastal wetlands is not only the key component of blue carbon storage but also plays an important role in vertical accretion, important for maintaining these habitats under relative sea-level rise. Remote sensing offers a cost-effective approach to study vegetation biomass at a broad spatial scale. We developed statistical models to predict peak aboveground green biomass of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, two dominant species of salt marshes using WorldView-2 satellite imagery at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) on the Mississippi coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The model accounted for nested data structures in the sampled biomass, assimilated uncertainties from data, parameters and model structures, and helped determine the best vegetation index among a variety of commonly-used indices to predict aboveground green biomass. We developed a series of mixed-effects models, which included different combinations of fixed effect(s), random intercept, and random slope(s). The fixed effects were species and one of the 60 vegetation indices derived from a WorldView-2 image obtained on 6 October 2012. The random effect used was site. We implemented the models in a Bayesian framework and selected the best model structure and vegetation index based on minimum posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion. The results showed that the best vegetation index to predict peak green biomass was the green chlorophyll index derived from the reflectance values of band 8 (near-infrared) and band 3 (green), and its effect on biomass prediction varied among sites. The inclusion of species as a fixed effect improved the model prediction. The study demonstrated the need to account for spatial dependence of data in developing a robust model, and the importance of the second WorldView-2 near-infrared band (860-1040nm) in predicting aboveground green biomass for the Grand Bay NERR. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling in Bayesian inference which coherently combined field and WorldView-2 data with uncertainties accounted for provides a robust and nondestructive tool for resource managers to monitor the status of coastal wetlands at a high spatial resolution in a timely manner. Through this study, we hope to emphasize the importance of appropriately accounting for nested data structures using mixed-effects models and promote wider application of Bayesian inference to facilitate assimilation of uncertainties in remote sensing applications.

AB  - Despite escalating anthropogenic alteration of food webs, how the carbon cycle in ecosystems is regulated by food web processes remains poorly understood. We quantitatively synthesize the effects of consumers (herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) on the carbon cycle of coastal wetland ecosystems, 'blue carbon' ecosystems that store the greatest amount of carbon per unit area among all ecosystems. Our results reveal that consumers strongly affect many processes of the carbon cycle. Herbivores, for example, generally reduce carbon absorption and carbon stocks (e.g. aboveground plant carbon by 53% and aboveground net primary production by 23%) but may promote some carbon emission processes (e.g. litter decomposition by 32%). The average strengths of these effects are comparable with, or even times higher than, changes driven by temperature, precipitation, nitrogen input, CO2 concentration, and plant invasions. Furthermore, consumer effects appear to be stronger on aboveground than belowground carbon processes and vary markedly with trophic level, body size, thermal regulation strategy and feeding type. Despite important knowledge gaps, our results highlight the powerful impacts of consumers on the carbon cycle and call for the incorporation of consumer control into Earth system models that predict anthropogenic climate change and into management strategies of Earth's carbon stocks.

AB  - Nature-based shoreline protection provides a welcome class of adaptations to promote ecological resilience in the face of climate change. Along coastlines, living shorelines are among the preferred adaptation strategies to both reduce erosion and provide ecological functions. As an alternative to shoreline armoring, living shorelines are viewed favorably among coastal managers and some private property owners, but they have yet to undergo a thorough examination of how their levels of ecosystem functions compare to their closest natural counterpart: fringing marshes. Here, we provide a synthesis of results from a multi-year, large-spatial-scale study in which we compared numerous ecological metrics (including habitat provision for fish, invertebrates, diamondback terrapin, and birds, nutrient and carbon storage, and plant productivity) measured in thirteen pairs of living shorelines and natural fringing marshes throughout coastal Virginia, USA. Living shorelines were composed of marshes created by bank grading, placement of sand fill for proper elevations, and planting of S. alterniflora and S. patens, as well as placement of a stone sill seaward and parallel to the marsh to serve as a wave break. Overall, we found that living shorelines were functionally equivalent to natural marshes in nearly all measured aspects, except for a lag in soil composition due to construction of living shoreline marshes with clean, low-organic sands. These data support the prioritization of living shorelines as a coastal adaptation strategy.

AB  - Salt marshes are large carbon reservoirs as part of blue carbon ecosystems. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the net ecosystem (NEE) and methane (CH4) exchange between salt marshes and the atmosphere to fully understand their carbon dynamics. We tested the influence of biophysical drivers by plant phenological phases (i.e., Greenup, Maturity, Senescence and Dormancy) on NEE and CH4 exchange in a grass-dominated temperate tidal salt marsh. We used three years of data derived from eddy covariance, PhenoCam (to measure vegetation phenology), and ancillary meteorological and water/soil variables. Overall, NEE showed significant differences among all phenological phases (p < 0.05), while CH4 exchange had significant differences among all phases except for Greenup and Dormancy. Net CO2 uptake was higher across Maturity (-61 g C-CO2 m(2)), while CO2 emissions were higher during Dormancy (182 g C-CO2 m(2)). The lower but constant CO2 emissions during Dormancy overshadowed the CO2 uptake during the growing season and contributed to >72% of the annual CO2 emissions in this ecosystem. Net CH4 emissions were higher during Maturity (3.7 g C-CH4 m(2)) and Senescence (4.2 g C-CH4 m(2)). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) substantially influenced (r(2) > 0.57) daytime NEE across phenological phases, but a combination of variables including water table level (WTL), water temperature and atmospheric pressure were relevant to explain CH4 exchange. The study site was an overall net carbon source to the atmosphere with annual emissions of 13-201 g C-CO2 m(-2)yr(-1) and 8.5-15.2 g C-CH4 m(-2)yr(-1). Our findings provide insights on: a) the role of plant phenological phases on ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes; b) challenges for modeling ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes in salt marshes; and c) the potential net loss of carbon to the atmosphere that should be considered for carbon management and accounting in these ecosystems.

AB  - Restoring degraded freshwater wetlands may help to maximize soil carbon sequestration. In this study, we use 18 Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates from two hydrologically restored freshwater coastal acid sulfate soil (CASS) wetlands. Recent OC accumulation rates (from similar to 1980 to present) were estimated to be 251 +/- 26 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the seasonally inundated CASS and 227 +/- 50 g.m(-2).year(-1) in the permanently inundated CASS. The average OC accumulation during the previous century (190 +/- 20 g.m(-2).year(-1)) was within the range of blue carbon ecosystems (saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrasses). Considering their large area and carbon accumulation rate, we estimate that Australian CASS wetlands sequester approximately 7.8 +/- 0.8 Tg of carbon annually, which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, preserving or restoring CASS may be a good climate change mitigation strategy.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal freshwater wetlands are highly productive and can sequester large amounts of carbon. The carbon accumulation rates here suggest that coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) are also a substantial sink of CO2. By extrapolating our observations, we show that approximately 7.79 Tg of carbon is sequestered in Australian CASS wetlands annually which is equivalent to similar to 8% of the CO2 emission from fossil fuels in Australia. Hence, managing CASS wetlands to protect their soil carbon store function may help offset anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gasses and their hydrological remediation could be an important component to the global carbon cycle.

AB  - As storm-driven coastal flooding increases under climate change, wetlands such as saltmarshes are held as a nature-based solution. Yet evidence supporting wetlands' storm protection role in estuaries-where both waves and upstream surge drive coastal flooding-remains scarce. Here we address this gap using numerical hydrodynamic models within eight contextually diverse estuaries, simulating storms of varying intensity and coupling flood predictions to damage valuation. Saltmarshes reduced flooding across all studied estuaries and particularly for the largest-100 year-storms, for which they mitigated average flood extents by 35% and damages by 37% ($8.4 M). Across all storm scenarios, wetlands delivered mean annual damage savings of $2.7 M per estuary, exceeding annualised values of better studied wetland services such as carbon storage. Spatial decomposition of processes revealed flood mitigation arose from both localised wave attenuation and estuary-scale surge attenuation, with the latter process dominating: mean flood reductions were 17% in the sheltered top third of estuaries, compared to 8% near wave-exposed estuary mouths. Saltmarshes therefore play a generalised role in mitigating storm flooding and associated costs in estuaries via multi-scale processes. Ecosystem service modelling must integrate processes operating across scales or risk grossly underestimating the value of nature-based solutions to the growing threat of storm-driven coastal flooding.

AB  - There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating 'blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon within
   Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge.
   We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.

AB  - We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine how the decomposition of particulate belowground organic matter from a salt marsh is enhanced, or not, by different mixtures of crude oil, nitrogen (N), or phosphorus (P) acting individually or synergistically. The experiment was conducted in 3.8 L sampling chambers producing varying quantities of gas whose volume was used as a surrogate measure of organic decomposition under anaerobic conditions. Gas production after 28 days, from highest to lowest, was +NP = +N >>> +P, or +oil. The gas production under either +P or +oil conditions was indistinguishable from gas production in the control chamber. Nitrogen, not phosphorus, or +NP, was the dominant factor controlling organic decomposition rates in these experiments. The implication for organic salt marsh soils is that shoreline erosion is enhanced by salt marsh oiling, presumably by its toxicity, but not by its effect on the decomposition rates of plant biomass belowground. Nutrient additions, on the other hand, may compromise the soil strength, creating a stronger disparity in soil strength between upper and lower soil layers leading to marsh loss. Nutrient amendments intended to decrease oil concentration in the marsh may not have the desired effect, and are likely to decrease soil strength, thereby enhancing marsh-to-water conversions in organic salt marsh soils.

AB  - Seagrasses are distinct flowering plants which thrive underwater. They are part of a complex ecosystem that supports different forms of life. Recent studies found out that coastal wetlands - mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrass, are far more proficient in sequestering and storing carbon than terrestrial ecosystems. Although seagrasses occupy only 0.2% of the area of the oceans, they sequester approximately 15% of total carbon storage in the ocean. Several remote sensing techniques are available to map and monitor seagrasses but most of them focus only on extent and area coverage. To estimate the carbon sequestration of seagrass beds, aside from extent, other parameters are needed such as leaf area index, percent cover, density, biomass etc., However, there are limits in mapping seagrass parameters using remote sensing. The reflectance measured by sensors is affected by other factors such as water absorption, turbidity, dissolved organic matter, depth and phytoplankton which affects the backscattering of energy. In this study, different remotely sensed datasets and field data were used to measure the parameters needed to estimate the carbon sequestration. Multispectral satellite images such as Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope were utilized to map the distribution and percent cover. High-resolution RGB images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were also utilized to correlate field data gathered parameters. Field data such as species, percent cover, leaf area index, canopy height and above ground biomass were gathered in situ. Data extracted from different remote sensing technologies were put together to support the estimation of carbon sequestration of seagrass beds.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have been identified as vital global carbon (C) sinks; however, soil C sequestration in these ecosystems is susceptible to impacts of non-native species invasion and climate change worldwide. Although their potential impacts on soil organic C (SOC) storage have been reported in previous literature, the well-established mechanisms that control SOC storage response, especially in relation to soil depths, is still limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a structural equation model (SEM) to identify mechanisms that account for SOC changes in topsoil (0-03 m) and subsoil (0.3-0.6 m) on coastal wetland of the East China Sea, where SOC in both depths increased with exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion. In the initial model, we hypothesized that there were a set of direct and indirect effects of the invasion, climate, and soil physicochemical properties on SOC storage. By evaluating the interactions of these factors, we found relatively complex patterns that vary with depth. For topsoil, the invasion had not only direct effects on SOC storage, but also indirect effects through mediating effects of soil water content (SWC) that was linked to fine soil fractions. For subsoil, the invasion was indirectly related to SOC storage through mediating effects of SOC in topsoil, SWC, and salinity. SOC in subsoil was also affected by temperature. Our results highlight that the response of SOC storage to the invasion and climate change results from the interacting effects of climate-plant-soil system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.

AB  - Mangroves are encroaching into salt marshes throughout the world as a result of environmental change. Previous studies suggest mangroves trap sediment more efficiently than adjacent salt marshes, providing mangroves greater capacity to adapt to sea level rise; this may occur by displacing salt marshes. However, sediment transport in adjacent marsh-mangrove systems and its role in mangrove encroachment upon salt marsh remain poorly understood. Here we directly test the hypothesis that mangroves reduce the ability of adjacent marsh to adjust to sea level rise by measuring sediment transport across salt marsh platforms, with and without 6 m of fringing mangroves at the tidal creek edge. We find that salt marshes and mangroves have equivalent sediment trapping efficiencies along the wetland edge. Suspended sediment concentrations, mass accumulation rates, and long-term accretion rates are not lower in salt marshes landward of mangroves than salt marshes without fringing mangroves. Therefore, our work suggests that a relatively narrow zone of mangroves does not impact salt marsh accretion, and activities that limit mangrove encroachment into salt marsh, such as removal of seedlings, will not improve the capacity of salt marsh to trap sediments.

AB  - Tidal salt marsh is a key defense against, yet is especially vulnerable to, the effects of accelerated sea level rise. To determine whether salt marshes in southern New England will be stable given increasing inundation over the coming decades, we examined current loss patterns, inundation-productivity feedbacks, and sustaining processes. A multi-decadal analysis of salt marsh aerial extent using historic imagery and maps revealed that salt marsh vegetation loss is both widespread and accelerating, with vegetation loss rates over the past four decades summing to 17.3 %. Landward retreat of the marsh edge, widening and headward expansion of tidal channel networks, loss of marsh islands, and the development and enlargement of interior depressions found on the marsh platform contributed to vegetation loss. Inundation due to sea level rise is strongly suggested as a primary driver: vegetation loss rates were significantly negatively correlated with marsh elevation (r (2) = 0.96; p = 0.0038), with marshes situated below mean high water (MHW) experiencing greater declines than marshes sitting well above MHW. Growth experiments with Spartina alterniflora, the Atlantic salt marsh ecosystem dominant, across a range of elevations and inundation regimes further established that greater inundation decreases belowground biomass production of S. alterniflora and, thus, negatively impacts organic matter accumulation. These results suggest that southern New England salt marshes are already experiencing deterioration and fragmentation in response to sea level rise and may not be stable as tidal flooding increases in the future.

AB  - The fluxes of trichloromethane (CHCl3, CM) and tetrachloromethane (CCl4, TCM) were seasonally measured using static flux chambers over an annual cycle in a coastal salt marsh, East China. The salt marsh presented as a large sink for both the compounds in the growing season (from April to October), but it was a minor source for the gas species in the non-growing season. Generally, the cordgrass marsh acted as a sink of CM and TCM. The net consumption of CM and TCM observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentrations and enriched soil organic matter that result in anoxic sediments. Higher plants were suggested to be an important sink for CM and TCM in the growing season, but a net source in the non-growing season. However, the mechanism responsible for the plant removal process is not clear. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are considered as a significant sink of global carbon due to their tremendous organic carbon storage. Coastal CO2 and CH4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem CO2 exchange, NEE; ecosystem respiration, ER; gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; and CH4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest NEE (-1365.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), ER (660.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), GEP (-2025.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and acted as a CH4 source (0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook CH4 (-0.02 to -0.12 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates (GEP, ER, NEE, and CH4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., ER and CH4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the YRD. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems store large quantities of organic carbon for long periods of time. This study explores organic carbon stock change through the first comparative study of radiometric analysis and repeat field measures over a multi-decadal period in a mangrove system. Examining one tall gallery forest of Avicennia marina, and an adjacent interior scrub mangrove of mixed Avicennia marina and Aegiceras corniculatum, radiometric analysis estimated a soil organic carbon accumulation rate of 4.3 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall gallery forest and 2.2 +/- 0.5 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in a stunted mangrove. Repeat measures of root carbon separated by 30 years estimated an increase of 5.06 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the tall forest and 6.63 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) in the stunted forest-suggesting an underestimate of carbon accumulation by radiometric dating of 15% and 67% in the tall and stunted forest, respectively. A higher carbon stock in the interior forest was attributed to root mass increase, associated with landward mangrove encroachment. Extrapolated to the entire region of NSW we estimate that mangrove encroachment has contributed at least about 1.8 Tg C sequestration over the 70 years for which this has been observed in New South Wales, Australia.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico shoreline received varied types and amounts of weathered oil residues after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.
   IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.

AB  - Tidal wetlands contain large reservoirs of carbon in their soils and can sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) at a greater rate per unit area than nearly any other ecosystem. The spatial distribution of this carbon influences climate and wetland policy. To assist with international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement, national-level assessments such as the United States (U.S.) National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and regional, state, local, and project-level evaluation of CO2 sequestration credits, we developed a geodatabase (CoBluCarb) and high-resolution maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution by linking National Wetlands Inventory data with the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database. For over 600,000 wetlands, the total carbon stock and organic carbon density was calculated at 5-cm vertical resolution from 0 to 300 cm of depth. Across the continental United States, there are 1,153-1,359 Tg of SOC in the upper 0-100 cm of soils across a total of 24945.9 km(2) of tidal wetland area, twice as much carbon as the most recent national estimate. Approximately 75% of this carbon was found in estuarine emergent wetlands with freshwater tidal wetlands holding about 19%. The greatest pool of SOC was found within the Atchafalaya/Vermilion Bay complex in Louisiana, containing about 10% of the U.S. total. The average density across all tidal wetlands was 0.071 g cm(-3) across 0-15 cm, 0.055 g cm(-3) across 0-100 cm, and 0.040 g cm(-3) at the 100 cm depth. There is inherent variability between and within individual wetlands; however, we conclude that it is possible to use standardized values at a range of 0-100 cm of the soil profile, to provide first-order quantification and to evaluate future changes in carbon stocks in response to environmental perturbations. This Tier 2-oriented carbon stock assessment provides a scientific method that can be copied by other nations in support of international requirements.

AB  - Coastal habitats, including mangroves, salt marsh, and seagrass meadows, provide numerous ecosystem services, including improved water quality, shoreline stabilization, and essential fish habitat. Over the past few decades, the quantification of greenhouse gas fluxes in wetlands has improved, leading to the recognition of these habitats as long-term carbon sinks. Quantifying this "blue carbon" as an ecosystem service provides added value for wetland protection and restoration and serves as a useful management tool when implementing plans for sustained ecosystem health and productivity. Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), a highly urbanized estuary, provides an interesting case study to assess the role of blue carbon in supporting management and informing restoration decisions. This review provides results from the Tampa Bay Blue Carbon Assessment, which quantified existing carbon stocks and identified the future carbon sequestration trajectories of coastal habitats with respect to climate change and sea-level rise. Examples are provided of how these data can be used to prioritize restoration efforts, support and enhance management decisions, and potentially attract new partners to support wetland restoration projects that offer additional climate change mitigation and adaptation benefits. This added valuation can help drive investment towards additional wetland restoration activities to help meet management targets in estuaries worldwide.

AB  - The stable nitrogen isotope ratio in tissue of the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa) was investigated as an indicator of the source of nitrogen inputs to coastal salt marshes. Initially, mussels were fed a diet of N-15-enriched algae in the laboratory to determine how the tissue nitrogen isotope ratio (delta N-15) changed with time. Steady-state times were calculated and found to be size dependent, ranging from 206 to 397 d. This indicated that mussels are long-term integrators of delta N-15 from their diet and may reflect nitrogen inputs to a marsh. Next, indigenous mussels were collected from 10 marshes with similar hydrology and geomorphology in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, and mussel delta N-15 Values were evaluated as indicators of nitrogen source. Significant positive correlations were observed between delta N-15 in mussels and the fraction of residential development in the marsh watersheds. In contrast, mussel isotope ratios showed significant negative correlations with the fraction of combined agricultural and recreational land use. These correlations suggested that the mussel nitrogen isotope signature is influenced by nitrogen derived from human activities in the adjoining marsh watershed. A more detailed examination of these relationships indicated that land use practices in close proximity to marshes and estuarine characteristics may also influence the observed nitrogen isotope signature. A simple, empirical model based on the 10 watersheds was developed to predict mussel delta N-15 from land use characteristics. The predictive ability of the model was tested with data from 12 additional marshes having similar geomorphology as the original 10, but differing in hydrology and mode of nutrient input. The model showed that ribbed mussel nitrogen isotope signatures may provide information on the source of nitrogen to coastal areas. This could be of use in developing general policies or strategies for monitoring and assessing coastal eutrophication. In addition, the isotopic ratio of mussels is useful as a proxy for watershed land use practices when assessing ecological responses to nutrient enrichment in coastal marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes have been suggested to be a large potential source for methyl chloride (CH3Cl) that is the major natural carrier of chlorine to the stratosphere. However, the global budget of this trace gas is uncertain, and the empirical field data are still lacking. In this study, CH3Cl fluxes were measured seasonally using static flux chambers from April 2004 to January 2005, along an elevational gradient of a coastal salt marsh in eastern China. To estimate the contribution of higher plants to the flux, plant aboveground biomass was experimentally removed and the flux difference between the treatment and the intact was examined. In addition, the flux was analyzed in relation to soil and weather conditions.
   Along the elevational gradient, the salt marsh generally functioned as a net sink in the growing season (from April to October 2004). The flux of CH3Cl ranged between -1.27 and -29.33 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive for emission and negative for consumption), and the maximum negative rates occurred at the mudflat and the cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh. However, the measurements made during inundation indicated that the mudflat was a net source of the gas. In the non-growing season (from November to March), the vegetated flat, when frozen, was a minor source of methyl chloride, with an emission rate ranging from 0.27 to 9.13 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). However, the measurements made during non-frozen periods indicate that the mudflat was a minor sink of methyl chloride. Overall, the study marsh was a large net sink for the gas because the magnitude of the consumption rates was lager than that of emission, and because the duration of the growing season was longer than that of the non-growing season. Plant aboveground biomass had a great effect on the flux. Comparative analyses showed that higher plants were present as an important source of CH3Cl, and it could balance 17.26-67.66% of the soil consumption. The net CH3Cl consumption rate was negatively correlated to soil dissolved salt content and light intensity, but it was positively correlated to soil temperature, soil organic matter content, and ambient atmospheric concentration of CH3Cl. This suggests that the overall net consumption of CH3Cl observed in the study marsh may result from the high ambient atmospheric concentration that ranged between 1.3 and 58.5 ppb, and enriched soil organic matter that feed the soil microorganisms using CH3Cl as a sole source for both carbon and energy.

AB  - In response to the 2010 oil spill from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, this experiment aims to study the ecological impact of the crude oil and dispersant (COREXIT (R) EC 9500A) in a coastal salt marsh ecosystem. The marsh sediment was incubated under an anaerobic condition with exposure to the crude oil or/and dispersant. The experiments were conducted in two continuous phases of nitrate addition to study denitrification potential using acetylene blockage technique and organic matter mineralization potential indicated by CO2 production in the sediment. Results show that the oil slightly (with no statistical significance p > 0.05) increased both the denitrification and organic matter mineralization activities, likely due to oil components serving as additional organic matter. In contrast, the dispersant significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited denitrification, but stimulated organic matter mineralization activities in the sediment due to unknown mechanisms. As a consequence, redox potentials (Eh) were much lower in the dispersant treated systems. The ecological impacts from the dispersant exposure may come from two fronts. First, loss of organic matter from the coastal marsh will threaten the long-term stability of the ecosystem, and the decrease in denitrification activity will weaken the N removal efficiency. Secondly, more reducing conditions developed by the dispersant exposure will likely preserve the oil in the ecosystem for an extended period of time due to weaker oil biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.

AB  - As part of research into the re-establishment of the native species Scirpus mariqueter in the salt marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, the roles of revegetation mode (planting density), site characteristics (sediment texture and hydrological regime) and community age (recently restored and mature marshes) in the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) were examined. In recently restored marsh characterized by muddy sediments with moderate sediment accretion, vegetation growth and SOC and SN storage increased along with the increase in planting densities and the SOC storage was 1.14-1.52 times greater than that in non-vegetated plots after two years of revegetation. The SOC storage under a high planting density equated to approximately 75% of the carbon stock in the mature marsh. However, the increase in SOC storage was much less in those sites characterized by silty sediments than that in sites with muddy sediment, even when a high planting density was applied. This is attributed to a lower rate of sediment deposition and inhibition of below-ground root growth, which was found to be strongly correlated with carbon and nitrogen stocks in the soil. Additionally, the main rooting system of S. mariqueter and SOC and SN storage were concentrated in the top similar to 20 cm in the recently restored marshes. These results demonstrate that successful vegetation restoration plays a key role in determining SOC and SN storage within a salt marsh. The restoration of native S. mariqueter for SOC and SN stocks is most effective when conducted in muddy sediments with good sedimentation rates and using a high planting density. In contrast, costs will be higher and recovery time longer in silty (or sandy) sediments, due to their poorer conditions for plant growth and significantly lower rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation.

AB  - Salt marshes are globally important sites of carbon burial, but microbial processes in their soil produce potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) that can be released back to the atmosphere. Although a great deal is known about how shifting seasons, tides, and salinity influence salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions, little effort has been devoted to understanding how emissions respond to bioturbation and pollution. In this study, we evaluated how fiddler crab bioturbation and oil pollution altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes from Louisiana salt marsh soil through a series of microcosm incubation experiments. CO2 and CH4 fluxes did not consistently increase as a function of crab burrow depth even though soil CO2 and CH4 concentrations increased with depth. Instead, regardless of burrow depth, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were highest (536.7 +/- 41.6 and 6.35 +/- 0.59 nmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively) immediately after burrowing activity ceased and within similar to 2 h decreased to a low background level (117.4 +/- 17.1 and 0.53 +/- 0.26). These background CO2 fluxes persisted through the end of our experiments, but background CH4 fluxes were not detectable after < 1 day, suggesting an important role for methanotrophy. Therefore, crab burrow size had a strong influence on CO2 fluxes, while the rate of burrow excavation was more important for CH4 fluxes. Low to moderate oil concentrations (up to 25.55 mg cm(-2)) did not alter greenhouse gas fluxes. However, severe oil contamination that decreases fiddler crab abundance and burrowing activity will also indirectly decrease salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions. These findings illuminate the importance of fiddler crab bioturbation to salt marsh carbon cycling and export.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are among the Earth's most productive ecosystems and provide a number of ecosystem services. Water quality regulation by storing, transforming and releasing nutrients, organic matter and suspended sediment is recognized as one of the most important functions of salt marshes. The self-purification capacity of intertidal ecosystems contributes to mitigating nutrient inputs, acting as a buffer zone between watersheds and coastal waters, especially in relation to climate change and the increasing frequency of impulsive extreme events. Understanding sediment and nutrient fluxes and assessing the mechanisms that control them are valuable for the preservation and future restoration of salt marshes and for enhancing their effectiveness in providing water quality regulation services.
   To investigate the main driving factors in microtidal environments, changes in suspended sediment and nutrient concentrations were measured during several tidal cycles in a small microtidal reconstructed salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon, which was selected as the experimental site. The tidal amplitude, nutrients and total suspended solid concentrations were measured during 6 tidal cycles between September 2011 and October 2013. The water discharge was derived by forcing the hydrodynamic MIKE-DHI numerical model with the measured tidal levels. Fluxes were assessed by coupling field data with the calculated discharges. The salt marsh filtering function was related to the inflow matter concentrations and tidal amplitude. When high suspended solid and nutrient concentrations enter the salt marsh, accumulation processes prevail on release. In contrast, in the case of low concentrations and high tidal excursion, the salt marsh functions as a nutrient and sediment source. During all campaigns, the nitrogen removal function was more effective within the intertidal vegetated areas. Sediment release was the dominant process in the outermost creek, whereas sedimentation prevailed in the inner area of the salt marsh because of the attenuation of hydrodynamic forcing during tide propagation.

AB  - Soil metal pollution in two Sarcocornia salt marshes within the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, South America) was evaluated through pseudo-total and bioavailable metal levels and pollution indexes. Soil conditions were also studied. The pseudo-total metal concentrations were similar in both salt marshes and followed the same decreasing order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cd. Bioavailable metals presented different patterns between salt marshes. The percentages of the bioavailable fraction varied between 28 and 80%, being higher than 60% for Cu, Zn and Pb. Organic matter ruled the distribution of all metals, except Pb. Using shale average concentration as background level, indexes did not show pollution nor enrichment, whereas using as background levels local values, anthropogenic enrichment was found for all metals and most metals showed moderate metal pollution. Our results showed that bioavailable metals levels and indexes using local background values provide an adequate assessment of metal pollution in salt marsh soils.

AB  - The root:shoot ratio of grassland plants may be lower in high fertility sites than in low fertility sites as plants modify their root, rhizome and shoot morphologies (and masses) to suit prevailing nutrient availability. We conducted geographically diverse and regionally specific field sampling and measured above- and belowground plant biomasses in western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico salt marshes to determine whether there is a similar morphological response in Spartina alterniflora, the dominant salt marsh plant. Coastal nutrient addition/enrichment, which is widespread and ongoing, may lower root and rhizome biomass, belowground production and organic accumulation in this species. Higher soil respiration and a lower Eh (redox potential) are expected additional soil property changes. The addition of P, more than of N, seems to reduce root and rhizome biomass accumulation. The cumulative effects of increased nutrient loadings on salt marshes may be to decrease soil elevation and accelerate the conversion of emergent plant habitat to open water, particularly on the lower marsh. The recommendations for management practices intended to conserve coastal marshes include reducing nutrient loading to coastal zones, solving water quality problems with a multiple nutrient approach, and choosing monitoring metrics that are based on both above- and belowground plant biomass.

AB  - The sediments of coastal wetlands contain large stores of carbon which are vulnerable to oxidation once disturbed, resulting in high levels of CO2 emissions that may be avoided if coastal ecosystems are conserved or restored. We used a simple model to estimate CO2 emissions from mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and tidal marshes based on known decomposition rates for organic matter in these ecosystems under either oxic or anoxic conditions combined with assumptions of the proportion of sediment carbon being deposited in either oxic or anoxic environments following a disturbance of the habitat. Our model found that over 40 years after disturbance the cumulative CO2 emitted from tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds were 70-80% of the initial carbon stocks in the top meter of the sediment. Comparison of our estimates of CO2 emissions with empirical studies suggests that (1) assuming 50% of organic material moves to an oxic environment after disturbance gives rise to estimates that are similar to CO2 emissions reported for tidal marshes; (2) field measurements of CO2 emissions in disturbed mangrove forests were generally higher than our modeled emissions that assumed 50% of organic matter was deposited in oxic conditions, suggesting higher proportions of organic matter may be exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance in mangrove ecosystems; and (3) the generally low observed rates of CO2 emissions from disturbed seagrasses compared to our estimates, assuming removal of 50% of the organic matter to oxic environments, suggests that lower proportions may be exposed to oxic conditions in seagrass ecosystems. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the fate of wetland sediment carbon in the marine environment after disturbance. Greater knowledge of the distribution, form, decomposition, and emission rates of wetland sediment carbon after disturbance would help to improve models.

AB  - Little is known about the nature of, organic sulfur (S) in soils of the Marsh in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany. In addition to total and inorganic S, we determined two organic S fractions, (ester sulfate-sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur) in 14 aerated. mineral top horizons of two salt marshes and ten dyked polder soils of different age. All soils, developed from marine sediments. Total S concentrations ranged from 153 to 950 mg kg(-1). Organic S was the main S constituent (range from 53 to 99% with a median of 97%). Higher inorganic S levels were found Only in the salt marshes due to soluble sulfate (15 to 47%). The younger marsh soils (salt marshes and soils of a polder dyked in 1978) had unique high S, contents of 0.9 to 2.4% in their, organic matter, whereas the S contents of the organic matter in older marsh soils were at only 0.6%, This S-rich organic matter is a heritage of a former anoxic marine environment. In most horizons the carbon-bonded S was the dominant sulfur form. However, both carbon-bonded S and ester sulfate-S did not relate to soil age. This limits the benefit of the wet chemical fractionation procedure used,for,studying the fate of organic S in marsh soils.

AB  - Tidal wetlands produce long-term soil organic carbon (C) stocks. Thus for carbon accounting purposes, we need accurate and precise information on the magnitude and spatial distribution of those stocks. We assembled and analyzed an unprecedented soil core dataset, and tested three strategies for mapping carbon stocks: applying the average value from the synthesis to mapped tidal wetlands, applying models fit using empirical data and applied using soil, vegetation and salinity maps, and relying on independently generated soil carbon maps. Soil carbon stocks were far lower on average and varied less spatially and with depth than stocks calculated from available soils maps. Further, variation in carbon density was not well-predicted based on climate, salinity, vegetation, or soil classes. Instead, the assembled dataset showed that carbon density across the conterminous united states (CON US) was normally distributed, with a predictable range of observations. We identified the simplest strategy, applying mean carbon density (27.0 kg C m -3 ), as the best performing strategy, and conservatively estimated that the top meter of CONUS tidal wetland soil contains 0.72 petagrams C. This strategy could provide standardization in CONUS tidal carbon accounting until such a time as modeling and mapping advancements can quantitatively improve accuracy and precision.

AB  - Data from an accounting of the woodland fund, from forestry and soil science investigations, and of dynamics of logging and forest-drying reclamation were used to calculate the stocks and balance of organic carbon in forest and marsh biogeocenoses of Karelia. The carbon stock in forest ecosystems equals 1.13 billion tons (128.3 t/ha), and in marsh ecosystems 3.74 billion tons (1030.0 tons/ha). In both cases, the bulk of the stocks are located in the soil. The balance of carbon in forest biogeocenoses currently is negative (-2.34 million tons), while in marshes it is positive (+0.88 million tons).

AB  - Habitat destruction caused by human activities is threatening wetland plants. Based on Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI, and Google Earth images, we analysed the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant populations in a degraded wetland in the Minjiang River Estuary from 2009 to 2019. Field survey records, tasselled cap transformation, and supervised classification were used for the image interpretation. The results indicate that the plant habitat area decreased by 42.1% over these 10 years. Consequently, the distribution area of each dominant species declined, and the proportion of total vegetated area in the habitat decreased from 53.1% to 32.6%. Moreover, the dominance relations of the species changed fromSpartina alterniflora > Phragmites australis > Cyperus malaccensis > Scirpus triquetertoP. australis > S. alterniflora > C. malaccensis > S. triqueter. We predict that the vegetation landscape in the wetland will be composed exclusively ofP. australisandS. alternifloraif habitat destruction continues. Finally, our research shows that the NPCS (net plant carbon sequestration) and PCS (plant carbon stock) in the wetland and the average values of methane flux, NPCS, PCS, and SOCS (sediment organic carbon stock) in the vegetated area have all decreased due to plant population declines.

AB  - Salt marsh soils sequester large amounts of organic matter (OM). The question we address in this study is how OM quality changes during initial soil development in salt marshes. To answer this question, we studied soils at six sites at the German North Sea coast. At each site, three zones - low, mid, and high marsh - that differ in inundation frequency were analyzed. We found that organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents increased significantly with decreasing inundation frequency at all sites, while inorganic carbon contents decreased. delta C-13 signatures of the OC strongly decreased at all sites from low to high marsh (from -153 to -21.5 parts per thousand), indicating a decrease in the proportion of marine-derived OC. The decrease in sea-derived OC was associated with an increase in C/N ratio, which can be attributed to the difference in the C/N ratios between sea- and land-derived OM inputs. Increases in OC and N contents in the bulk soils during soil development resulted from increases of the OC content in the coarse size fraction (>200 mu m), and were associated with increases in the content of hot water extractable C and N (C-hwe and N-hwe). The proportion of OM found in the fraction <2 mu m decreased with soil development. The delta C-13 signature of the OC sequestered in this fraction decreased from -20.6 to -24.0 parts per thousand. The smaller decrease in the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the fraction <2 mu m compared to the delta C-13 signatures of the OC in the bulk soils indicates that the OC is relatively rigidly bound to the minerals in this fraction. The low delta C-13 signatures of OC stored in the fraction <2 mu m indicates that OM in this fraction is mainly of terrestrial origin. In conclusion, this study shows that OM contents and the proportion of relatively labile OM increases during initial marsh soil development due to inputs of terrestrial OC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite overall global declines, mangroves are expanding into and within many subtropical wetlands, leading to heterogeneous cover of marsh-mangrove coastal vegetation communities near the poleward edge of mangroves' ranges. Coastal wetlands are globally important carbon sinks, yet the effects of shifts in mangrove cover on organic-carbon (OC) storage remains uncertain. We experimentally maintained black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) or marsh vegetation in patches (n = 1,120, 3 x 3 m) along a gradient in mangrove cover (0-100%) within coastal wetland plots (n = 10, 24 x 42 m) and measured changes in OC stocks and fluxes. Within patches, above and belowground biomass (OC) was 1,630% and 61% greater for mangroves than for recolonized marshes, and soil OC was 30% greater beneath mangrove than marsh vegetation. At the plot scale, above and belowground biomass increased linearly with mangrove cover but soil OC was highly variable and unrelated to mangrove cover. Root ingrowth was not different in mangrove or marsh patches, nor did it change with mangrove cover. After 11 months, surface OC accretion was negatively related to plot-scale mangrove cover following a high-wrack deposition period. However, after 22 months, accretion was 54% higher in mangrove patches, and there was no relationship to plot-scale mangrove cover. Marsh (Batis maritima) leaf and root litter had 1,000% and 35% faster breakdown rates (k) than mangrove (A. germinans) leaf and root litter. Soil temperatures beneath mangroves were 1.4 degrees C lower, decreasing aboveground k of fast- (cellulose) and slow-decomposing (wood) standard substrates. Wood k in shallow soil (0-15 cm) was higher in mangrove than marsh patches, but vegetation identity did not impact k in deeper soil (15-30 cm). We found that mangrove cover enhanced OC storage by increasing biomass, creating more recalcitrant organic matter and reducing k on the soil surface by altering microclimate, despite increasing wood k belowground and decreasing allochthonous OC subsidies. Our results illustrate the importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal OC storage, but also indicate that the impacts of vegetation change on OC storage may vary based on ecosystem conditions, organic-matter sources, and the relative spatiotemporal scales of mangrove vegetation change.

AB  - The potential influence of fiddler crab burrow density on the processes controlling organic matter (OM) accumulation was examined in Virginia salt marshes. As burrows may affect important chemical and biological processes that influence belowground plant production and decomposition, experimental manipulations were designed to modify fiddler crab burrow density by either increasing them (artificially constructed holes) or decreasing them (exclosures) and comparing them to areas naturally with and without fiddler crab burrows. The only significant difference among treatments was associated with the presence of holes without regard for whether they were artificial or natural. Higher burrow density resulted in an increase in soil redox potential, which most likely caused higher decomposition, even though sulfate-reduction rates were not different among treatments. Belowground production decreased with increased burrow density resulting in less OM addition to the soil. Higher decomposition and lower belowground production resulted in a net loss of 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in marshes with higher burrow densities, while areas with few to no burrows accumulated up to 245 g C m(-2) yr(-1), equaling a surface accretion rate of 4 mm yr(-1). Examination of 6 other salt marshes in the region revealed a negative correlation between fiddler crab density and soil OM content, lending strength to the argument that bioturbation is a potentially important explanatory factor of OM accumulation in salt marshes and may influence how sea level rise impacts coastal marshes.

AB  - We assessed key relationships of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks to hydromorphic features, soil texture, C/N ratio, pH, and forest age in hardwood floodplain forests. Floodplain ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, particularly due to their SOC storage potential. Interactions between heterogeneous microrelief and anthropogenically affected vegetation and the hydrologic situation of floodplains make predicting SOC stocks difficult without field validation. Especially within hardwood floodplain forests, the controlling factors for SOC storage remain understudied, whereas these floodplain types can be the largest reservoir for carbon and have a substantial SOC sequestration potential. To determine the controlling factors for SOC storage, we selected 38 hardwood floodplain forest and 11 floodplain grasslands of the lower middle Elbe River and categorized them according to vegetation type (grassland, young forest, or old forest) and hydrologic situation (low-lying or high elevated and active or former floodplain). Profile SOC stocks were determined to a depth of 1 m, and topsoil SOC stocks were related to vegetation and soil characteristics, particularly pedological traits (e.g., hydromorphic features).
   Forest SOC stocks ranged between 99 and 149 t ha(-1). SOC stocks decreased with depth throughout all categories and were unaffected by vegetation type within the same hydrologic situation. Vegetation parameters such as age, basal area, or leaf litter carbon stock had no direct effect on SOC stocks. An active connection to the river had the strongest effect on SOC stocks, with former floodplain sites storing 33% less SOC than the active sites. Within the active floodplains, low sites stored 50% more SOC than high sites. This effect was mainly controlled by relief-affected features such as flooding duration and fine texture, which also were the strongest univariate predictors for SOC stocks (R-2 = 0.39 and 0.63). A multiple linear regression showed that fine texture, pH, C/N ratio and forest age can be used to explain 86% of variance in SOC stocks.
   We conclude that proxies for relief and sedimentation (i.e., hydromorphic features, flooding duration, soil texture, C/N ratio, and pH) are the strongest factors controlling SOC stocks in hardwood floodplain forests. Both can be related to allochthonous carbon inputs, increasing SOC stabilization through the accumulation of fine soil particles, and decreasing aerobic carbon mineralization potential through oxygen scarcity, while vegetation plays only a subordinate role.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration through accumulated plant biomass and storage in soils can potentially make wetland ecosystems net C sinks. Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g Cm-2 day(-1) through plant photosynthesis. About 41-46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6-13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7-44.7 Mg CO2 year(-1) across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was -0.87 to -0.56 g CO2-eq m(-2) day(-1), indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76-$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431-$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink.

AB  - Plain Language Summary Mangroves are blue carbon systems characterized by high soil carbon storage and sequestration. Soil carbon losses via groundwater or pore water pathways are potentially important yet poorly understood components of mangrove carbon budgets. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and associated dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) fluxes into a mangrove-dominated tropical bay (Maowei Sea) using a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model. The SGD fluxes in Maowei Sea were estimated to be 4.9x10(7) (0.360.33m/day) and 2.6x10(7)m(3)/day (0.200.18m/day) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively, implying that SGD may respond to precipitation. The SGD-derived DIC and DOC fluxes (molm(-2)day(-1)) in the wet season (DIC: 0.700.82; DOC: 0.310.30) were higher than those in the dry season (DIC: 0.250.24; DOC: 0.25 +/- 0.23). These SGD-derived carbon fluxes exceed local river inputs and constituted >70% of the total DIC and DOC input into the bay. If scaled up to the global weighted mangrove area in combination with data from other 32 study sites, carbon fluxes via SGD into mangroves may be equivalent to 29-48% of the global riverine input into the ocean. Therefore, we suggest that SGD is a major component of coastal carbon budgets and that accounting for SGD helps to reduce uncertainties in mangrove blue carbon budgets.
   Mangrove soils sequester large amounts of carbon, but little is known on the loss of carbon via groundwater pathways. Here we quantified submarine groundwater discharge using radon and related dissolved inorganic and organic carbon fluxes in a mangrove-dominated tropical bay in China (Maowei Sea). Combining our results with literature data revealed that groundwater fluxes in mangroves are significant and should be considered in blue carbon assessments.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to China in 1979 for the purpose of sediment stabilization and dike protection, and has continuously replaced native plants or invaded bare mudflats in the coastal marsh. To evaluate the spatial variation of CH4 emission and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage along the invasion chronosequence, we selected four sites including bare mudflat (Control, as first year invasion), and marshes invaded by S. alterniflora in 2002 (SA-1), 1999 (SA-2) and 1995 (SA-3), respectively, in Sheyang county, Jiangsu, China and set up the marsh mesocosm system for flux measurement. The mean accumulation rate of SOC in the 0-30 cm layer exponentially increased with the invasion time, ranging from 1.08 (over the first 9 years) to 235 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (over the period of 12-16 years). The cumulative CH4 emission during the growth season was 20.5, 75.4, 81.0 and 92.2 kg CH4 ha(-1) in Control, SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3, respectively, and there was a binomial relationship between CH4 emission and invasion time. Cumulative CH4 emission was logarithmically increased with SOC concentration; however the ratio of CH4 emission to SOC concentration was inversely correlated with the invasion time in the S. alterniflora marsh, suggesting that the less increased SOC in the S. alterniflora marsh was converted into CH4. The net global warming potential (GWP) was estimated at 733 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tidal mudflat and reduced to -1273 (SA-1) to -2233 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1) (SA-3) in the S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicated that S. alterniflora invasion effectively sequestrated atmospheric CO2 and mitigated GWP in the coastal marsh of China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

AB  - Chloromethane (CH3Cl) is the most abundant long-lived chlorinated organic compound in the atmosphere and contributes significantly to natural stratospheric ozone depletion. Salt marsh ecosystems including halophyte plants are a known source of atmospheric CH3Cl but estimates of their total global source strength are highly uncertain and knowledge of the major production and consumption processes in the atmosphere-halophyte-soil system is yet incomplete. In this study we investigated the halophyte plant, Salicornia europaea, and soil samples from a coastal salt marsh site in Sardinia/Italy for their potential to emit and consume CH3Cl and using flux measurements, stable isotope techniques and Arrhenius plots differentiated between biotic and abiotic processes. Our laboratory approach clearly shows that at least 6 different production and consumption processes are active in controlling atmospheric CH3Cl fluxes of a salt marsh ecosystem. CH3Cl release by dried plant and soil material was substantially higher than that from the fresh material at temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 degrees C. Results of Arrhenius plots helped to distinguish between biotic and abiotic formation processes in plants and soils. Biotic CH3Cl consumption rates were highest at 30 degrees C for plants and 50 degrees C for soils, and microbial uptake was higher in soils with higher organic matter content. Stable isotope techniques helped to distinguish between formation and degradation processes and also provided a deeper insight into potential methyl moiety donor compounds, such as S-adenosyl-l-methionine, S-methylmethionine and pectin, that might be involved in the abiotic and biotic CH3Cl production processes. Our results clearly indicate that cycling of CH3Cl in salt marsh ecosystems is a result of several biotic and abiotic processes occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere-plant-soil system. Important precursor compounds for biotic and abiotic CH3Cl formation might be methionine derivatives and pectin. All formation and degradation processes are temperature dependent and thus environmental changes might affect the strength of each source and sink within salt marsh ecosystems and thus considerably alter total fluxes of CH3Cl from salt marsh ecosystems to the atmosphere.

AB  - Coastal wetland soils store large amounts of organic carbon, which is becoming vulnerable to environmental changes such as exotic species invasion and climate change. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is also related to soil biogeochemical factors. To understand the mechanisms of these changes in regulating SOC, it is necessary to characterize the direct and indirect effects of exotic species invasion, climate, and soil variables on SOC. We used a structural equation model to identify the key driving mechanisms of SOC storage to a depth of 1 m at 15 sites on the East China coast, where Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) invasion has significantly influenced SOC storage. The model revealed several patterns that are expected to explain the enhanced SOC storage. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. SOC storage was also related to the interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fraction, and bulk density. The relative contribution of SOC in the topsoil to SOC storage at a depth of 1 m decreased over time, while the contribution increased for the SOC below the surface. These results highlight the interactions among S. alterniflora invasion, climate, and soil properties in regulating SOC dynamics. Our results imply that the relative importance of vertical patterns to SOC storage associated with S. alterniflora invasion and temperature fluctuations will change over time.
   Plain Language Summary The world's largest invasion of S. alterniflora is occurring in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal wetland soils, which are vulnerable to exotic species invasions, contain large amounts of organic carbon. The controlling mechanisms of soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with S. alterniflora invasion and climate change may be complex due to the interrelationships that exist among ecological factors. In our study, we investigated the effects of plant invasion, climate, and soils on SOC storage and its vertical distribution. We found that SOC storage was enhanced over time. Spartina alterniflora invasion had a direct effect on SOC storage mainly due to its impacts on biomass production. Temperature had an important influence on SOC storage and the subsurface SOC content. The interacting effects of S. alterniflora invasion and soil biogeochemical properties such as soil salinity, fine soil fractions, pH, and bulk density were also identified as having crucial impacts on SOC storage. Our results suggest an interesting possibility that the relative contribution of vertical patterns to the SOC pool is likely to change over the invasion period.

AB  - Soil organic C, N, and P were measured in salt, brackish, and tidal freshwater marshes in river-dominated estuaries (Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla) of the Georgia coast to evaluate the effects of salinity on C, N, and P storage and accumulation. Tidal freshwater marshes had greater concentrations of organic C (10.81% w/w) and N (0.71% w/w) than brackish (7.71% C, 0.50% N) or salt (5.95% C, 0.35% N) marshes. Soil accretion rates of Cs-137 were greater in tidal freshwater (4.78 mm yr(-1)) and brackish marshes (4.41 mm yr(-1)) than in salt marshes (1.91 mm yr(-1)). Consequently, organic C and N accumulation was greater in tidal freshwater (124 and 8.2 g m-(2) yr(-1)) and brackish (93 and 6.5 g m(-2) yr(-1)) marshes than salt marshes (40 and 2.4 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Phosphorus accumulation was greater in the brackish marshes. Lower salinity tidal freshwater and brackish marshes remove more C, N, and P; however, salt marshes dominate the spatial extent of the study area (60%) vs. brackish (33%) and tidal freshwater marshes (7%). Combining measurements of C, N, and P accumulation with tidal marsh area, we estimated that tidal freshwater, brackish, and salt marshes stored or removed the equivalent of 2 to 20% of watershed N inputs entering the estuaries from the terrestrial landscape. After accounting for N, fixation and denitrification, tidal marshes collectively removed the equivalent of 13 to 32% of the N entering estuaries. Tidal marshes, especially tidal freshwater and brackish marshes, are important for improving water quality and decreasing the impacts of N eutrophication of estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - In natural tidal marshes, nutrient fertilization stimulates complex responses, bringing into question the suitability of nutrient-rich dredged material as a substrate for tidal marsh restoration. We examined vegetation and elevation trends in the constructed tidal marshes at Poplar Island, Maryland where fine-grained dredged material (high nutrient) and locally dredged sand (low nutrient) were used as substrates. Macrophyte production was higher and root:shoot ratios lower in dredged material marshes. Measured vertical accretion was similar in dredged material (7.4 +/- 0.6 mm y(-1)) and sand (6.4 +/- 0.9 mm y(-1)) marshes, and is keeping pace with local sea-level rise. A detailed carbon budget was developed for one dredged material marsh to examine carbon dynamics under high nutrient availability. High annual macrophyte production combined with small exports via tidal exchange and methane emissions resulted in an annual carbon burial of 206 g C m(-2) y(-1), and calculated vertical accretion of 6.5 mm y(-1) from organic matter. This is attributed to the contribution of organic matter from aboveground biomass due to protection from perimeter dikes constructed to contain dredged material during placement, reducing marsh exposure and organic matter export. With appropriate design and management, fine-grained, high-nutrient dredged material makes a suitable substrate for tidal marsh restoration.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (co-benefits') for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. Marine protected areas' (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet additionality' requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based locally managed marine areas' (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts. LMMAs likely deliver additional sequestration, although ensuring permanence' of carbon stocks may be more difficult to achieve. This review summarizes key approaches of blue carbon monitoring; governance systems; policy instruments; and investment pathways for conservation and restoration.

AB  - Groundwater-surface water exchange in salt marsh ecosystems mediates nearshore salt, nutrient, and carbon budgets with implications for biological productivity and global climate. Despite their importance, a synthesis of salt marsh groundwater studies is lacking. In this review, we summarize drivers mediating salt marsh hydrogeology, review field and modeling techniques, and discuss patterns of exchange. New data from a Delaware seepage meter study are reported which highlight small-scale spatial variability in exchange rates. A synthesis of the salt marsh hydrogeology literature reveals a positive relationship between tidal range and submarine groundwater discharge but not porewater exchange, highlighting the multidimensional drivers of marsh hydrogeology. Field studies are heavily biased towards microtidal systems of the US East Coast, with little global information available. A preliminary estimate of marsh porewater exchange along the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Bights is 8-30 x 10(13) L y(-1), equivalent to recirculating the entire volume of seawater overlying the shelf through tidal marsh sediments in similar to 30-90 years. This review concludes with a discussion of critical questions to address that will decrease uncertainty in global budget estimates and enhance our capacity to predict future responses to global climate change.

AB  - Tidal marshes are coastal ecosystems that store large amounts of sedimentary organic carbon (OC). Reducing the current uncertainty on the amount of OC stored these sediments requires the analysis of a large number of sediment samples. Soil sensing techniques, using mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR), have been proven to be a valid alternative for standard OC measurements in a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the application of these techniques to tidal marsh sediments has been very limited and the error associated with calculated sedimentary OC stocks using MIR spectroscopy/PLSR data has up till now not been evaluated. Therefore, we assessed the potential of MIR spectroscopy/PLSR to predict the OC concentration and OC stock of tidal marsh sediments in a temperate estuary (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and The Netherlands). Based on a cross -validation procedure, the results show that MIR spectroscopy/PLSR predicts the OC concentration of tidal marsh sediments along the entire estuary with a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.56% OC). Similar accuracies were obtained for the prediction of sedimentary OC concentrations from independent tidal marshes. Organic carbon concentrations from tidal marshes in the salt portion of the estuary were, however, predicted more accurately using a PLSR model trained exclusively with sediment samples from this salinity zone. Combining depth profiles of predicted OC concentrations with measured bulk densities resulted in predictions of total OC stocks with a relative error < 4% for freshwater and brackish marshes, while errors for salt marshes were up to 30%. As MIR spectroscopy/PLSR is not able to accurately predict bulk density or OC density, standard field measurements of bulk density remain necessary to reliably predict sedimentary OC stocks in tidal marshes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.
   In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores.
   Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In coastal ecosystems, denitrification is a key process in removing excess dissolved nitrogen oxides and participating in the control of eutrophication process. Little is known about the role of salt marshes on nitrogen budgets in cold weather coastal areas. Although coastal salt marshes are important sites for organic matter degradation and nutrient regeneration, bacterial-mediated nitrogen cycling processes, such as denitrification, remain unknown in northern and sub-arctic regions, especially under winter conditions. Using labelled nitrogen (N-15), denitrification rates were measured in an eastern Canadian salt marsh in August, October and December 2005. Freshly sampled undisturbed sediment cores were incubated over 8 h and maintained at their sampling temperatures to evaluate the influence of low temperatures on the denitrification rate. From 2 to 12 degrees C, average denitrification rate and dissolved oxygen consumption increased from 9.6 to 25.5 mu mol N-2 m(-2) h(-1) and from 1.3 to 1-8 mmol O-2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively, with no statistical dependence of temperature (p > 0.05). Nitrification has been identified as the major nitrate source for denitrification, supplying more than 80% of the nitrate demand. Because no more than 31% of the nitrate removed by sediment is estimated to be denitrified, the presence of a major nitrate sink in sediment is suspected. Among possible nitrate consumption mechanisms, dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium, metal and organic matter oxidation processes are discussed. providing the first measurements of denitrification rate in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh, this study evidences the necessity of preserving and restoring marshes. They constitute an efficient geochemical filter against an excess of nitrate dispersion to coastal waters even under cold northern conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant invasion alters the fundamental structure and function of native ecosystems by affecting the biogeochemical pools and fluxes of materials and energy. Native (Suaeda salsa) and invasive (Spartina alterniflora) salt marshes were selected to study the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and stocks in the Yellow River Delta. Results showed that the SOC contents (g/kg) and stocks (kg/m(2)) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years, especially for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The SOC contents exhibited an even distribution along the soil profiles in native salt marshes, while the SOC contents were gradually decreased with depth after Spartina alterniflora invasion of seven years. The natural ln response ratios (LnRR) were applied to identify the effects of short-term Spartina alterniflora invasion on the SOC stocks. We also found that Spartina alterniflora invasion might cause soil organic carbon losses in a short-term phase (2-4 years in this study) due to the negative LnRR values, especially for 20-60 cm depth. And the SOCD in surface layer (0-20 cm) do not increase linearly with the invasive age. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that silt + clay content was exponentially related with SOC in surface layer (Adjusted R-2 = 0.43, P < 0.001), suggesting that soil texture could play a key role in SOC sequestration of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Macroalgal communities in Australia and around the world store vast quantities of carbon in their living biomass, but their prevalence of growing on hard substrata means that they have limited capacity to act as long-term carbon sinks. Unlike other coastal blue carbon habitats such as seagrasses, saltmarshes and mangroves, they do not develop their own organic-rich sediments, but may instead act as a rich carbon source and make significant contributions in the form of detritus to sedimentary habitats by acting as a "carbon donor" to "receiver sites" where organic material accumulates. The potential for storage of this donated carbon however, is dependent on the decay rate during transport and the burial efficiency at receiver sites. To better understand the potential contribution of macroalgal communities to coastal blue carbon budgets, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using key words, including carbon sequestration, macroalgal distribution, abundance and productivity to provide an estimation of the total amount of carbon stored in temperate Australian macroalgae. Our most conservative calculations estimate 109.9 TgC is stored in living macroalgal biomass of temperate Australia, using a coastal area covering 249,697 km(2). Estimates derived for tropical and subtropical regions contributed an additional 23.2 Tg C. By extending the search to include global studies we provide a broader context and rationale for the study, contributing to the global aspects of the review. In addition, we discuss the potential role of calcium carbonate-containing macroalgae, consider the dynamic nature of macroalgal populations in the context of climate change, and identify the knowledge gaps that once addressed will enable robust quantification of macroalgae in marine biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We conclude that macroalgal communities have the potential to make ecologically meaningful contributions toward global blue carbon sequestration, as donors, but given that the fate of detached macroalgal biomass remains unclear, further research is needed to quantify this contribution.

AB  - Salt marshes are an important transition zone between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and in their natural state, they often function to cycle or trap terrestrially derived nutrients and organic matter. Many US salt marshes were ditched during the twentieth century, potentially altering their functionality. The goal of this 4-year study was to assess the impact of water from ditches within seven salt marshes on estuarine water quality and plankton communities within four estuaries on Long Island, NY, USA. We found that concentrations of inorganic nutrients (ammonium, phosphate), dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen and carbon (POC, PON, DOC, DON), and total coliform bacteria were significantly enriched in salt marsh ditches compared to the estuaries they discharged into. In addition, concentrations of ammonium and DON became more enriched in ditches as tidal levels decreased, suggesting these constituents were generated in situ. Quantification of nitrogen sources in Flanders Bay, NY, suggested salt marsh ditches could represent a substantial source of N to this estuary during summer months. Experimental incubations demonstrated that water from salt marsh ditches was capable of significantly enhancing the growth of multiple classes of phytoplankton, with large diatoms and dinoflagellates displaying the most dramatic increases in growth. Experiments further demonstrated that salt marsh ditchwater was capable of significantly enhancing pelagic respiration rates, suggesting discharge from ditches could influence estuarine oxygen consumption. In summary, this study demonstrates that tidal draining of salt marsh ditches is capable of degrading multiple aspects of estuarine water quality.

AB  - Plant-mediated processes determine carbon (C) cycling and storage in many ecosystems; how plant-associated processes may be altered by climate-induced changes in environmental drivers is therefore an essential question for understanding global C cycling. In this study, we hypothesize that environmental alterations associated with near-term climate change can exert strong control on plant-associated ecosystem C cycling and that investigations along an extended hydrologic gradient may give mechanistic insight into C cycling. We utilize a mesocosm approach to investigate the response of plant, soil, and gaseous C cycling to changing hydrologic regimes and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations expected by 2100 in a coastal salt marsh in Louisiana, USA. Although elevated CO2 had no significant effects on C cycling, we demonstrate that greater average flooding depth stimulated C exchange, with higher rates of labile C decomposition, plant CO2 assimilation, and soil C respiration. Greater average flooding depth also significantly decreased the soil C pool and marginally increased the aboveground biomass C pool, leading to net losses in total C stocks. Further, flooding depths along an extended hydrologic gradient garnered insight into decomposition mechanisms that was not apparent from other data. In C-4 dominated salt marshes, sea level rise will likely overwhelm effects of elevated CO2 with climate change. Deeper flooding associated with sea level rise may decrease long-term soil C pools and quicken C exchange between soil and atmosphere, thereby threatening net C storage in salt marsh habitats. Manipulative studies will be indispensable for understanding biogeochemical cycling under future conditions.
   Plain Language Summary This study examines how near-term climate change may affect the exchange and storage of carbon by plants in salt marshes. Our results indicate that sea level rise will increase the amount of carbon that is moved from the soil into the atmosphere, shrinking the amount of carbon in salt marsh soil. This may reduce the ability of salt marshes to keep carbon in soil long term and decrease the ability of salt marshes to offset climate change. As salt marshes are some of the best ecosystems on the planet for storing carbon in soils, any change in how these ecosystems process carbon is important to understand.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. However, rapid changes in the vegetation communities of salt marshes caused by exotic species invasion and plant propagation requires a better understanding of how these shifts affect the landscape-scale variations of gross primary production (GPP). In the Yangtze Estuary of eastern China, we firstly compared 2-years GPP values obtained through eddy covariance measurements, satellite-based estimations and model simulations in two vegetation mixtures consisting of exotic Spartina alterniflora (C-4 plant) and dominant native Phragmites australis and Scirpus spp. (C-3 plants) The results indicated that the low-resolution remote sensing data with light-use efficiency method did not represent well the seasonal course of GPP relative to flux measurements and underestimated the annual amount GPP by 25-32%. In contrast, a detailed process based vegetation model with species-specific parameterizations could identify the proportions of GPP from exotic C-4 and native C-3 vegetation and accurately reproduce the seasonal course and annual amount of GPP in the mixtures. The slopes of the linear regressions between the measured and modeled GPP were close (1.09 and 0.89 for the two mixtures, respectively) to the 1:1 line. To further evaluate the variations in GPP throughout the salt marshes, we coupled high-resolution remote sensing data to the vegetation model by transforming the vegetation index into the leaf area index (LAI) for different species. The coupled model reproduced the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP in the salt marshes with rapid community change during the period of 2000-2008 and identified the variations of GPP from different species. The simulations indicated that the contribution rate of exotic S. alterniflora to GPP has been greater than that of native species since 2003-2004. Therefore, we suggest that this method is useful for high-resolution estimations of regional GPP in other coastal marshes with invasive S. alterniflora in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In coastal wetlands, the effect of vegetation on soil organic carbon (C) quality is not clear. In this study, we investigated soil organic C and total nitrogen (N) in the whole soils, particulate organic matter (POM) and different aggregate fractions in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in Suaeda salsa clusters and bare grounds in the salt marshes of the Liaohe Delta, China. S. salsa increased soil organic C, total N, POMC and POMN concentrations in both soil layers. Interestingly, the presence of S. salsa caused an increase in the amount of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) in both 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths, whereas the vegetation effect on microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) and silt- and clay-sized fractions (< 0.053 mm) differed with soil depth. Compared with bare grounds, S. salsa clusters had higher soil organic C and N contents at each aggregate size class. Among the three aggregate size classes, the magnitude of increases in soil organic C and N contents in the macroaggregates was the largest. Our results suggest that vegetation substantially increases the proportion of relatively labile soil organic C and contributes to soil organic C sequestration in tidal salt marshes in the Liaohe Delta, China.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are considered buffer zones for the discharge of land-derived nutrients without accounting for potential negative side effects. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand the ecological assembly and dynamics of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in such systems. Here, we employed two complementary methodological approaches (i.e., shotgun metagenomics and quantitative PCR) to examine the distribution and abundance of selected microbial genes involved in N transformations. We used soil samples collected along a well-established pristine salt marsh soil chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development at the island of Schiermonnikoog, The Netherlands. Across the examined soil successional stages, the structure of the populations of genes involved in N cycling processes was strongly related to (shifts in the) soil nitrogen levels (i.e., NO3-, NH4+), salinity and pH (explaining 73.8% of the total variation, R-2 = 0.71). Quantification of the genes used as proxies for N fixation, nitrification and denitrification revealed clear successional signatures that corroborated the taxonomic assignments obtained by metagenomics. Notably, we found strong evidence for niche partitioning, as revealed by the abundance and distribution of marker genes for nitrification (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea) and denitrification (nitrite reductase nIrK, nirS and nitrous oxide reductase nosZ clades I and II). This was supported by a distinct correlation between these genes and soil physico-chemical properties, such as soil physical structure, pH, salinity, organic matter, total N. NO3-,NH4+ and SO42-, across four seasonal samplings. Overall, this study sheds light on the successional trajectories of microbial N cycle genes along a naturally developing salt marsh ecosystem. The data obtained serve as a foundation to guide the formulation of ecological models that aim to effectively monitor and manage pristine and impacted salt marsh areas. Such models should account for the ecology as well as the historical contingency of N cycling communities.

AB  - Extreme events such as storm surges, intense precipitation, and supermoons cause anomalous and large fluctuations in water level in tidal salt marshes, which impacts the sediment biogeochemistry that dictates arsenic (As) cycling. In addition to changes in water level, which impacts soil redox potential, these extreme events may also change salinity due to freshwater inputs from precipitation or saltwater inputs due to surge. It is currently unknown how As mobility in tidal salt marshes will be impacted by extreme events, as fluctuations in salinity and redox potential may act synergistically to mobilize As. To investigate impacts of extreme events on As cycling in tidal salt marshes, we conducted a combined laboratory and field investigation. We monitored pore water and soil samples before, during, and after two extreme events: a supermoon lunar eclipse followed by a storm surge and precipitation induced by Hurricane Joaquin in fall 2015 at the St. Jones Reserve in Dover, Delaware, a representative tidal salt marsh in the Mid-Atlantic United States. We also conducted soil incubations of marsh sediments in batch and in flow-through experiments in which redox potential and/or salinity were manipulated. Field investigations showed that pore water As was inversely proportional to redox potential. During the extreme events, a distinct pulse of As was observed in the pore water with maximum salinity. Combined field and laboratory investigations revealed that this As pulse is likely due to rapid changes in salinity. These results have implications for As mobility in the face of extreme weather variability.

AB  - Increased recognition of the global importance of salt marshes as 'blue carbon' (C) sinks has led to concern that salt marshes could release large amounts of stored C into the atmosphere (as CO2) if they continue undergoing disturbance, thereby accelerating climate change. Empirical evidence of C release following salt marsh habitat loss due to disturbance is rare, yet such information is essential for inclusion of salt marshes in greenhouse gas emission reduction and offset schemes. Here we investigated the stability of salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora) sediment C levels following seagrass (Thallasia testudinum) wrack accumulation; a form of disturbance common throughout the world that removes large areas of plant biomass in salt marshes. At our study site (St Joseph Bay, Florida, USA), we recorded 296 patches (7.5 +/- 2.3 m(2) mean area +/- SE) of vegetation loss (aged 3-12 months) in a salt marsh meadow the size of a soccer field (7 275 m(2)). Within these disturbed patches, levels of organic C in the subsurface zone (1-5 cm depth) were similar to 30% lower than the surrounding undisturbed meadow. Subsequent analyses showed that the decline in subsurface C levels in disturbed patches was due to loss of below-ground plant (salt marsh) biomass, which otherwise forms the main component of the long-term 'refractory' C stock. We conclude that disturbance to salt marsh habitat due to wrack accumulation can cause significant release of below-ground C; which could shift salt marshes from C sinks to C sources, depending on the intensity and scale of disturbance. This mechanism of C release is likely to increase in the future due to sea level rise; which could increase wrack production due to increasing storminess, and will facilitate delivery of wrack into salt marsh zones due to higher and more frequent inundation.

AB  - We examined the net exchange of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) between a tidal marsh and its adjacent estuary over a 1-year period from August 2007 to July 2008. Our objectives were to estimate the importance of tidal salt marshes as sources and sinks of mercury within the Chesapeake Bay system, and to examine the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on mercury fate and transport in tidal marshes. Tidal flows and water chemistry were measured at an established tidal flume at the mouth of the principal tidal creek of a 3-ha marsh section at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Fluxes were estimated by combining continuous tidal flow measurement for the entire study year, with discrete, hourly, flow-weighted measurements of filterable and particulate THg and MeHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) made over 20 tidal cycles during the year. We found that the marsh was a relatively small net tidal source of MeHg, mainly during the warmer growing season. We also confirmed that the marsh was a substantial source of DOC to the adjacent estuary. DOC was a significant predictor of both filterable THg and MeHg fluxes. However, although the marsh was a source of filterable THg, it was overall a net sink for THg because of particulate trapping. The net per-area annual flux of MeHg from tidal marshes is greater than other MeHg pathways within Chesapeake Bay. The annual load of MeHg from tidal marshes into Chesapeake Bay, however, is likely small relative to fluvial fluxes and efflux from bottom sediment. This study suggests that MeHg production within the tidal marsh has greater consequences for biota inhabiting the marsh than for the efflux of MeHg from the marsh.

AB  - Invasion by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora, which has high net primary productivity and superior reproductive capacity compared with native plants, has led to rapid organic carbon accumulation and increased methane (CH4) emission in the coastal salt marsh of China. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this effect, the methanogen community structure and CH4 production potential as well as soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic acids, methylated amines, aboveground biomass, and litter mass were measured during the invasion chronosequence (0-16 years). The CH4 production potential in the S. alterniflora marsh (range, 2.94-3.95 mu g kg(-1) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the bare tidal mudflat. CH4 production potential correlated significantly with SOC, acetate, and trimethylamine concentrations in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The abundance of methanogenic archaea also correlated significantly with SOC, and the dominant species clearly varied with S. alterniflora-driven SOC accumulation. The acetotrophic Methanosaetaceae family members comprised a substantial proportion of the methanogenic archaea in the bare tidal mudflat while Methanosarcinaceae family members utilized methylated amines as substrates in the S. alterniflora marsh. Ordination analysis indicated that trimethylamine concentration was the primary factor inducing the shift in the methanogenic archaea composition, and regressive analysis indicated that the facultative family Methanosarcinaceae increased linearly with trimethylamine concentration in the increasingly sulfate-rich salt marsh. Our results indicate that increased CH4 production during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence was due to increased levels of the noncompetitive substrate trimethylamine and a shift in the methanogenic archaea community.

AB  - Saltmarshes provide a broad range of ecosystem services, but have been degraded globally and are further threatened by sea-level rise. Changes in biomass partitioning between above- and belowground components of plant community biomass as a consequence of nutrient enrichment can impact those services profoundly. However, the evidence for such impacts is largely confined to North America, leaving a gap in global understanding of coastal ecosystem resilience. Using field surveys across 15 saltmarshes along the south and east coasts of Ireland, we tested whether aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) plant biomass allocation across all plant assemblages combined and within individual plant assemblages is related to soil nutrients. AG biomass and AG/BG biomass ratio were positively related, and BG biomass was negatively related to NOx-, both across all assemblages combined and within individual assemblages. AG biomass and AG/BG ratio were also positively related to NH4+ within individual assemblages, but not across all of them combined. The relationships between biomass and labile P were weaker, and their direction varied across the whole P gradient and among individual assemblages. These findings demonstrate broad, community-wide links between biomass allocation and soil nutrients in saltmarshes. The up to 6.6-fold increase in AG/BG biomass ratio along the N gradient, coupled with differential responses among functionally contrasting plants, could have significant implications for multiple saltmarsh functions such as energy fixation for consumers, wave attenuation, sediment binding and carbon storage. Improved understanding of the underlying causalities would help promoting saltmarsh resilience.

AB  - Background and aims Due to global warming, it is to be expected that mangroves will move north- and southwards and enter salt marshes, which will then be enriched with mangrove-derived organic compounds. Little is known about the effects that tannins, which are abundantly present in leaf litter of Rhizophora mangle, will have on the biogeochemical cycles in salt marsh soils.
   Methods In microcosms, soil from a Distichlis spicata salt marsh was enriched with R. mangle-derived leaf powder (LP), crude condensed tannins (CCT) and purified condensed tannins (PCT), or with commercially available tannic acid (TA). Each treatment received a fixed amount of tannins, i.e. 10mg /g dry soil. Due to the enrichment with tannins in each fraction, the amount of carbon added increased from C<TA=PCT<CCT<LP. At Day 7, 21, 35 and 42 of the incubation period, CO2 emission rates were determined after closing the microcosms for 24h. Net nitrogen and phosphorous mineralization rates were also determined for the entire incubation period. Experiments were done at Practical Salinity Units of 20, 28 and 35 to cover the range in salinities observed in the field (20 and 35 PSU).
   Results For the whole incubation period, the CO2 emission increased significantly (p<0.05) in the order of C<PCT<CCT=TA<LP microcosms. The microcosms with LP showed immobilization of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus, while the other microcosms revealed net nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization in the order of CCT<TA<PCT<C for N mineralization, and CCT=TA<C<PCT for P mineralization. The C and N mineralization rates measured at a salinity of 20 PSU were significantly larger than at 28 and 35 PSU.
   Conclusion The results showed that mangrove leaf litter stimulated net C mineralization and N and P immobilization. Purified condensed tannins of senescing R. mangle leaves enhanced C and P, and suppressed net N mineralization.

AB  - Organic matter (OM) accumulation in marsh soils affects marsh survival under rapid sea-level rise (SLR). This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay. This presents a possible mechanism for OM stabilization as marshes migrate inland. Regional index terms: USA, Maryland, Chesapeake Bay, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

AB  - Estimates of global carbon stocks in coastal wetlands reveal that these are some of the most efficient carbon-sequestering environments in the world, which has prompted a renewed interest in conservation and restoration programs as an opportunity for greenhouse gas abatement. Accumulation of carbon in coastal wetlands is linked to diverse factors such as the type of vegetation, geomorphic setting, and sediment supply. Feedbacks between these factors and the tidal flow conditions drive the dynamics of carbon accumulation rates. Climate change-induced sea-level rise has been shown to increase the vulnerability to submergence of saltmarsh and mangroves in coastal wetlands, even if accommodation and landward colonization are possible. These potential losses of wetland vegetation combined with the reduced productivity of newly colonized areas will directly affect the capacity of the wetlands to sequester carbon from sediments and root growth. Here, we implement an eco-geomorphic model to simulate vegetation dynamics, soil carbon accumulation, and changes in soil carbon stock for a restored mangrove-saltmarsh wetland experiencing accelerated sea-level rise. We evaluate model outcomes for existing conditions and two different management scenarios aimed at mitigating sea-level rise effects and conserve wetland vegetation. Even though some management measures can result in partial conservation of wetland vegetation, they do not necessarily result in the best option for soil carbon capture. Our results suggest that accelerated sea-level can trigger accelerated wetland colonization resulting in wetland areas with limited opportunities for soil carbon capture from sediment and root mineralization, an issue that has not been considered in previous studies.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems and store large amounts of organic carbon (C)-the so termed "blue carbon." However, wetlands in the tropics and subtropics have been invaded by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) affecting storage of blue C. To understand how S. alterniflora affects soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sources, stability, and their spatial distribution, we sampled soils along a 2500 km coastal transect encompassing tropical to subtropical climate zones. This included 216 samplings within three coastal wetland types: a marsh (Phragmites australis) and two mangroves (Kandelia candel and Avicennia marina). Using delta C-13, C:nitrogen (N) ratios, and lignin biomarker composition, we traced changes in the sources, stability, and storage of SOC in response to S. alterniflora invasion. The contribution of S. alterniflora-derived C up to 40 cm accounts for 5.6%, 23%, and 12% in the P. australis, K. candel, and A. marina communities, respectively, with a corresponding change in SOC storage of +3.5, -14, and -3.9 t C ha(-1). SOC storage did not follow the trend in aboveground biomass from the native to invasive species, or with vegetation types and invasion duration (7-15 years). SOC storage decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation (1000-1900 mm) and temperature (15.3-23.4celcius). Edaphic variables in P. australis marshes remained stable after S. alterniflora invasion, and hence, their effects on SOC content were absent. In mangrove wetlands, however, electrical conductivity, total N and phosphorus, pH, and active silicon were the main factors controlling SOC stocks. Mangrove wetlands were most strongly impacted by S. alterniflora invasion and efforts are needed to focus on restoring native vegetation. By understanding the mechanisms and consequences of invasion by S. alterniflora, changes in blue C sequestration can be predicted to optimize storage can be developed.

AB  - The reclamation of natural salt marshes for agricultural use is expected to profoundly influence the effects of predicted global warming on the carbon balance of coastal areas globally. This study was undertaken to understand the potential for soil respiration changes in a disturbed coastal ecosystem under future atmospheric warming
   An in situ simulated warming experiment was conducted in a reclaimed salt marsh on Chongming Island in the Yangtze Estuary, China. Open-top chambers (OTCs) were applied to simulate air-warming conditions.
   Based on the 2-year study, we found the following: (1) Averaged across the entire study period, the OTCs significantly increased the mean air temperature by 1.53 +/- 0.17 A degrees C. (2) The air warming resulted in no significant stimulation of the mean soil respiration averaged across the entire study period. Warming had no significant effect on soil respiration in the growing season, but it markedly reduced soil respiration by 16 % in the non-growing season. (3) Air warming had no significant effect on the mean soil temperature or volumetric moisture at a 5 cm depth, but it increased the mean soil porewater salinity by 119 % averaged across the entire study period. (4) Air warming had no significant effect on total organic carbon, total nitrogen or the molar C/molar N ratio of the soil in the uppermost 10 cm layer during the 2 years of soil respiration measurement. The warming treatment also had no significant effect on aboveground biomass or fine root (< 2 mm) density during the second year of soil respiration measurement. (5) Soil temperature accounted for 81.0 % and 79.0 % of the temporal variations of soil respiration in the control (CON) and elevated temperature (ET) plots, respectively. No significant correlation between soil volumetric moisture and soil respiration was observed in either CON or ET. Soil porewater salinity was positively correlated with soil respiration in CON, but such a positive correlation was not found in ET. No change of the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q (10) value) was observed.
   Based on above results, we speculate that soil porewater salinity was the key factor controlling the effects of air warming on soil respiration in the reclaimed salt marsh. Our results suggest that an air warming of approximately 1.5 A degrees C over the next few decades may not lead to a higher soil respiration in reclaimed salt marshes.

AB  - Invasive species can positively, neutrally, or negatively affect the provision of ecosystem services. The direction and magnitude of this effect can be a function of the invaders' density and the service(s) of interest. We assessed the density-dependent effect of an invasive marsh grass, Phragmites australis, on three ecosystem services (plant diversity and community structure, shoreline stabilization, and carbon storage) in two oligohaline marshes within the North Carolina Coastal Reserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NCNERR), USA. Plant species richness was equivalent among low, medium and high Phragmites density plots, and overall plant community composition did not vary significantly by Phragmites density. Shoreline change was most negative (landward retreat) where Phragmites density was highest (-0.40 +/- 0.19m yr(-1) vs. -0.31 +/- 0.10 for low density Phragmites) in the high energy marsh of Kitty Hawk Woods Reserve and most positive (soundward advance) where Phragmites density was highest (0.19 +/- 0.05 m yr(-1) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.07 for low density Phragmites) in the lower energy marsh of Currituck Banks Reserve, although there was no significant effect of Phragmites density on shoreline change. In Currituck Banks, mean soil carbon content was approximately equivalent in cores extracted from low and high Phragmites density plots (23.23 +/- 2.0 kg C m(-3) vs. 22.81 +/- 3.8). In Kitty Hawk Woods, mean soil carbon content was greater in low Phragmites density plots (36.63 +/- 10.22 kg C m(-3)) than those with medium (13.99 +/- 1.23 kg C m(-3)) or high density (21.61 +/- 4.53 kg C m(-3)), but differences were not significant. These findings suggest an overall neutral density-dependent effect of Phragmites on three ecosystem services within two oligohaline marshes in different environmental settings within a protected reserve system. Moreover, the conceptual framework of this study can broadly inform an ecosystem services-based approach to invasive species management.

AB  - Hundreds of explosive-contaminated marine sites exist globally, many of which contain the common munitions constituent hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Quantitative information about RDX transformation in coastal ecosystems is essential for management of many of these sites. Isotopically labelled RDX containing N-15 in all 3 nitro groups was used to track the fate of RDX in three coastal ecosystem types. Flow-through mesocosms representing subtidal vegetated (silt/eel grass), subtidal non-vegetated (sand) and intertidal marsh ecosystems were continuously loaded with isotopically labelled RDX for 16-17 days. Sediment, pore-water and overlying surface water were analyzed to determine the distribution of RDX, nitroso-triazine transformation products (NXs) and nitrogen containing complete mineralization products, including ammonium, nitrate - nitrite, nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas. The marsh, silt, and sand ecotypes transformed 94%, 90% and 76% of supplied RDX, respectively. Total dissolved NXs accounted for 2%-4% of the transformed N-15-RDX. The majority of RDX transformation in the water column was by mineralization to inorganic N (dissolved and evaded; 64%-78% of transformed N-15-RDX). RDX was mineralized primarily to N2O (62-74% of transformed 15 N-RDX) and secondarily to N-2 (1-2% of transformed N-15-RDX) which exchanged with the atmosphere. Transformation of RDX was favored in carbon-rich lower redox potential sediments of the silt and marsh mesocosms where anaerobic processes of iron and sulfate reduction were most prevalent. RDX was most persistent in the carbon-poor sand mesocosm. Partitioning of N-15 derived from RDX onto sediment and suspended particulates was negligible in the overall mass balance of RDX transformation (2%-3% of transformed N-15-RDX). The fraction of N-15 derived from RDX that was sorbed or assimilated in sediment was largest in the marsh mesocosm (most organic carbon). and smallest in the sand mesocosm (largest grain size and least organic carbon). Sediment redox conditions and available organic carbon stores affect the fate of RDX in different coastal marine habitats. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundPlants play a pivotal role in soil stabilization, with above-ground vegetation and roots combining to physically protect soil against erosion. It is possible that diverse plant communities boost root biomass, with knock-on positive effects for soil stability, but these relationships are yet to be disentangled.
   QuestionWe hypothesize that soil erosion rates fall with increased plant species richness, and test explicitly how closely root biomass is associated with plant diversity.
   MethodsWe tested this hypothesis in salt marsh grasslands, dynamic ecosystems with a key role in flood protection. Using step-wise regression, the influences of biotic (e.g. plant diversity) and abiotic variables on root biomass and soil stability were determined for salt marshes with two contrasting soil types: erosion-resistant clay (Essex, southeast UK) and erosion-prone sand (Morecambe Bay, northwest UK). A total of 132 (30-cm depth) cores of natural marsh were extracted and exposed to lateral erosion by water in a re-circulating flume.
   Results: Soil erosion rates fell with increased plant species richness ( R-2 = 0.55), when richness was modelled as a single explanatory variable, but was more important in erosion- prone ( R-2 = 0.44) than erosion- resistant ( R-2 = 0.18) regions. As plant species richness increased from two to nine species m(-2), the coefficient of variation in soil erosion rate decreased significantly ( R-2 = 0.92). Plant species richness was a significant predictor of root biomass ( R-2 = 0.22). Step- wise regression showed that five key variables accounted for 80% of variation in soil erosion rate across regions. Clay- silt fraction and soil carbon stock were linked to lower rates, contributing 24% and 31%, respectively, to variation in erosion rate. In regional analysis, abiotic factors declined in importance, with root biomass explaining 25% of variation. Plant diversity explained 12% of variation in the erosion- prone sandy region.
   ConclusionOur study indicates that soil stabilization and root biomass are positively associated with plant diversity. Diversity effects are more pronounced in biogeographical contexts where soils are erosion-prone (sandy, low organic content), suggesting that the pervasive influence of biodiversity on environmental processes also applies to the ecosystem service of erosion protection.

AB  - Salt marshes in Patagonia ecosystem are nowadays fully recognized by ecological, pollution and phytoremediation studies but a soil genesis and geomorphology approach is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to establish the soil-geomorphology relationship in Fracasso salt marsh and to determine the successional vegetation dynamics associated with the landscape evolution. This work was carried out in Fracasso salt marsh sited in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, where an integrated study on soil-geomorphology relationship and landscape evolution was performed along with sedimentological analysis and vegetation changes (C3 photosynthesis pathway vs. C4 photosynthesis pathway plants). This last was determined through the delta C-13 composition from soil organic matter (SOM). Soil descriptions and laboratory analysis of soil samples were performed. A marked relationship between the vegetation unit, the dominant landform and the type of associated soil was found. Limoniwn brasiliense (Lb) and Sarcocornia perennis (Sp), both C3 plants, are dominant in levees associated with tidal creeks, and soils were classified as Typic Fluvaquents, while Spartina alterniflora (Sa) soils were classified as Sodic Endoaquents and Sodic Psammaquents. Although no sulfidic materials were identified by incubation test, they were identified by hydrogen peroxide treatment in Sa soils, and now are considered potential acid sulfate soils (PASS). Sedimentological analysis from deepest sandy C horizons indicates a beach depositional environment. On the other hand, the delta C-13 stable isotope composition of SOM preserved into these buried soil acting as parent materials shows the dominance of C4 plants presumably belonging to Swarm species, suggesting a possible colonization and stabilization as the pioneer salt marsh.

AB  - In laboratory microcosms using salt marsh soils and in field trials, it was possible to monitor and quantify crude oil mineralization by measuring changes in CO2 delta(13)C signatures and the rate of CO2 production. These values are easy to obtain and can be combined with simple isotope mass balance equations to determine the rate of mineralization from both the crude oil and indigenous carbon pool. Hydrocarbon degradation was confirmed by simultaneous decreases in alkane-, isoprenoid-, and PAH-hopane ratios. Additionally, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of alkane degradation (0.087 day(-1)) and CO2 production (0.082 day(-1)) from oil predicted by the delta(13)C signatures were statistically indistinguishable. The addition of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate increased the rate of mineralization of crude oil in aerated microcosms but had no clear effect on in situ studies. This procedure appears to offer a means of definitively quantifying crude oil mineralization in a sensitive, inexpensive, and simple manner in environments with appropriate background delta(13)C signatures.

AB  - Coastal vegetation plays an important role for climate change mitigation. Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes.

AB  - Coastal salt marsh has been globally fragmented by man-made coastal seawalls. However, the dynamic changes in community structure and abiotic environments in these regenerated marsh after seawall reclamation are largely unknown. We analyzed the seasonal changes of soil nutrient pools and the direction effects on them. The results showed that soil total nitrogen (TN) has decreased but soil organic carbon (SOC) has increased from May to September. Direction has influenced the patterns and seasonal changes in soil TN and SOC. The potential influencing factors have been largely contributed to soil salinity reduction, vegetation growth, microorganism activities with different seasonal characteristics. Researches on seasonal dynamic of marsh regeneration after seawall reclamation can provide us helpful information to understand mechanism of marsh restoration and design coastal marsh restoration projects.

AB  - Coastal Louisiana is experiencing a significant loss of coastal wetland area due to increasing sea level rise, subsidence, sediment starvation and marsh collapse. The construction of large scale Mississippi River sediment diversions is currently being planned in an effort to help combat coastal wetlands losses at a rate of >50 km(-2) y(-1). The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is currently being used as a model for evaluating potential land gain from large scale diversions of Mississippi River water and sediment. In this study, we determine the impact of the WLD diversion on plant production at newly formed islands within the delta and adjacent, mainland freshwater marshes. Plant aboveground productivity, sediment nutrient status and short term accretion were measured at three locations on a transect at each of three fresh water marsh sites along Hog Bayou and at six newly formed emerging island sites in the delta. Spring flooding has resulted in a greater increase in plant production and consequently, greater carbon sequestration potential in adjacent mainland marshes compared to the newly formed island sites, which contain less total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the sediment. While sediment diversions are predicted to create land, as seen in island formation in the WLD, the greatest benefit of river sediment diversions from a carbon credit perspective might be to the adjacent freshwater mainland marshes for several reasons. Both greater plant production and sediment C accumulation are two important factors for marsh stability, while perhaps even more critical, is the prevention of the loss of stored sediment C in the marsh profile. This stored C would be lost without the introduction of freshwater, nutrients and sediment through river sediment diversion efforts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in arctic soils may influence the global carbon cycle and be an important feedback mechanism to global climate changes. In order to estimate the carbon stock and accumulation rates at Flakkerhuk on Disko Island in West Greenland, an 1800-ha study area was divided into land cover types using a satellite image. Total SOC was estimated to be on average 67.3 ton C ha(-1) (6.7 kg m(-2)) and the fen area contributing 42% of the total SOC. Soil profiles investigated at different terraces revealed that the SOC stock was significantly age-related, increasing six fold from a terrace dated to 7000 (BP) to 2 one dated to 10,000 (BP). This equals an average soil C accumulation rate of 0.5 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1). This rate was compared to vegetation-specific accumulation rates in the last 7000 yr which were in the order of 0.05 kg C m(-2) 100 yr(-1) in heath and sparse vegetation, 0.4 in fen areas and between 2 and 5 kg C m(-2) the last 100 yr in the present salt marsh. The study shows the importance of landscape history and age when sampling and evaluating SOC stocks and provides estimates of arctic soil C accumulation rates during Holocene versus present rates.

AB  - 1. In many coastal salt marshes. water transparency is decreased by the resuspension of sediments. We analyse the influence of suspended not-photosynthetic matter on the regulation of phosphorus (P) dynamics in the water column., compared with the role of phytoplankton and sediments.
   2. Field surveys and manipulative experiments of P enrichment in light and dark enclosures, open and closed at their bottom, were performed in the brackish Lake Alimini Grande (Otranto, LE, Italy).
   3. Water transparency in Alimini Grande was inversely related to seston organic mass. 98.8% of which was composed of dead organic matter and heterotrophic organisms.
   4. P enrichment experiments showed an increase of the phytoplankton biomass with time from the beginning of the manipulation (4.9 times) in the light enclosures. but also an exponential decrease of P concentration in all the enclosures, even in the dark one closed at the bottom.
   5. The rate of P removal from the water column was not significantly affected by phytoplankton activity, even though P concentration was always lower in light than in dark enclosures, or by the activity of sediments.
   6. Dead suspended organic matter with associated micro-organisms seemed to remove nutrients very efficiently from the water column in Lake Alimini Grande, contributing significantly to control the potential risk of lake eutrophication. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In salt marshes, the hydrodynamics and the availability of iron, organic matter and sulphate, influence the formation and/or dissolution of iron sulfides and iron oxyhydroxides. Therefore, they constitute key factors affecting the iron biogeochemical processes in these environments. The aim of this work is to evaluate the physicochemical and mineralogical variations associated to iron biogeochemistry in palaeo and actual salt marshes in the area of influence of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Pampean Plain, Argentina. In soils of exhumed palaeo marshes, the iron contents are 56-95 mu mol g(-1), whereas these contents decrease to 36-75 mu mol g(-1) in actual marsh soils. The presence of framboidal and poliframboidal pyrites associated with gypsum, barite, calcite, halite and iron oxyhydroxides defines the conditions of the pedosedimentary sequences of the Holocene paleomarshes. Sequences of pyrite formation (sulfidization) and degradation (sulfuricization) were observed. These processes were evidenced by a sequential extraction, reflecting that the largest proportion of iron is in the form of crystalline iron oxides (28-76 %) and lepidocrocite (6-16 %); while the proportion associated with ferrihydrite and pyrite is low (0-9 and 1-17 %, respectively). These facts could be partly explained by the complex redox processes characteristic of these environments, such as aeration generated by the rhizosphere and intense bioturbation by invertebrates. These iron biomineralizations have been useful because they allow paleoenvironmental interpretations and characterization of paleomarshes, and environmental inferences related to the management of actual salt marshes.

   Merging physiological data with ecosystem services valuation provides valuable insights into the impact of climate change in coastal salt marsh systems.
   Salt marshes are valuable ecosystems, as they provide food, shelter, and important nursery areas for fish and macroinvertebrates, and a wide variety of ecosystem services for human populations. These ecosystem services heavily rely on the floristic composition of the salt marshes with different species conferring different service values and different adaptation and resilience capacities towards ecosystem stressors. Blue carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous stocks are no exception to this, and rely on the interspecific differences in the primary production metabolism and physiological traits. Furthermore, these intrinsic physiological characteristics also modulate the species response to any environmental stressor, such as the ones derived from ongoing global changes. This will heavily shape transitional ecosystem services, with significant changes of the ecosystem value of the salt marshes in terms of cultural, provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, with a special emphasis on the possible alterations of the blue carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous stocks retained in these key environments. Thus, the need to integrate plant physiological characteristics and feedbacks towards the expected climate change-driven stressors becomes evident to accurately estimate the ecosystem services of the salt marsh community, and transfer these fundamental services into economic assets, for a fluid communication of the ecosystems value to stakeholders, decision and policy makers, and environmental management entities.

AB  - In this study, two sediment cores (C1 and C2) were collected from the Andong salt marsh southwest of Hangzhou Bay and analysed to determine their different sedimentary phosphorus (P) forms. The changes in the sedimentary P forms over the past 30 years and the implication of these changes on environmental risks were determined. The low mean total P (TP) contents along C1 (30.42 mg/kg) and C2 (68.60 mg/kg) indicate no P pollution in the Andong salt marsh. The sedimentary TP and all P forms decreased towards the present due to a reduction in particle size and an overall decrease in nutrient input. The sedimentary P contents were also affected by other factors, such as typhoons, bridge construction and aquaculture activities that facilitated erosion and increased P input, whereas drought caused a reduction in sedimentary P. Organic P (OP) represented more than half of the TP, and NaOH-P (P bound to Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides) represented more than half of the inorganic P (IP), indicating an overall high level of bioavailable P. Thus, the sediments in the Andong salt marsh could be releasing P during organic matter decomposition and under anoxic conditions.

AB  - Vertical accretion in tidal marshes is necessary to prevent submergence due to rising sea levels. Mineral materials may be more important in driving vertical accretion in tidal freshwater marshes, which are found near the heads of estuaries, than has been reported for salt marshes. Accretion rates for tidal freshwater marshes in North America and Europe (n = 76 data points) were compiled from the literature. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses revealed that both organic and mineral accumulations played a role in driving tidal freshwater marsh vertical accretion rates, although a unit mass of organic material contributed similar to 4 times more to marsh volume than the same mass input of mineral material. Despite the higher mineral content of tidal freshwater marsh soils, this ability of organic matter to effectively hold water and air in interstitial spaces suggests that organic matter is responsible for 62% of marsh accretion, with the remaining 38% from mineral contributions. The organic material that helps to build marsh elevation is likely a combination of in situ production and organic materials that are deposited in association with mineral sediment particles. Regional differences between tidal freshwater marshes in the importance of organic vs. mineral contributions may reflect differences in sediment availability, climate, tidal range, rates of sea level rise, and local-scale factors such as site elevation and distance to tidal creeks. Differences in the importance of organic and mineral accumulations between tidal freshwater and salt marshes are likely due to a combination of factors, including sediment availability (e.g., proximity to upland sources and estuarine turbidity maxima) and the lability of freshwater vs. salt marsh plant production.

AB  - A small body of research suggests that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can affect the carbon balance of peatlands, yet this has not been tested widely, despite the fact that peatlands contain approximately one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Here we evaluate the role of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in a site that receives low atmospheric sulfur deposition. We hypothesized that, in peatlands receiving low sulfate inputs, methane production should dominate anaerobic carbon mineralization. We further hypothesized that with sulfate amendments, anaerobic carbon mineralization could show an overall increase if terminal carbon mineralization in unamended peat is limited by an inadequate supply of electron acceptors. To test these hypotheses, we delineated six 1-m(2) plots in an ombrotrophic, boreal peatland in central Alberta, Canada (Bleak Lake Bog), which receives <2 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1). Three of the plots were amended with sulfate (78 mmol S.m(-2).yr(-1)). We measured anaerobic rates of sulfate reduction, CH4 production, and CO2 production. In opposition to our hypotheses, sulfate amendments did not increase rates of sulfate reduction, increase CO2 production, or decrease CH4 production over a 2-yr period, but did increase both sulfate pool sizes and residence times. Despite low rates of sulfate reduction compared to other freshwater wetlands, daily average sulfate reduction (1.7 mmol/m(2)) exceeded regional annual inputs of atmospheric sulfate deposition (1.6 mmol/m(2)). Between 77% and 99% of reduced sulfate was incorporated into the carbon-bonded sulfur pool, which turns over slowly. The slow turnover rate and comparatively low sulfate reduction rates may be related to the low iron content of the bog peat. Additionally, sulfate reduction initially was sulfate limited in the control plots, but with sulfur amendments, the sulfate limitation was removed; sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by some other factor, possibly labile carbon. Dissimilatory sulfate reduction was more important to total anaerobic carbon mineralization than methane production, although neither process dominated overall anaerobic carbon mineralization (<2% of total). Fermentation appeared to be the dominant anaerobic carbon mineralization pathway at Bleak Lake Bog, yet the mechanisms of how this process affects the carbon balance of peatlands has never been evaluated. Overall, our results suggest that, in at least the short term, soil carbon turnover in peatlands will not be enhanced by increased atmospheric sulfur deposition. If we want to understand the controlling factors on soil carbon storage in sites like Bleak Lake Bog, we should begin to examine anaerobic carbon mineralization via fermentation pathways.

AB  - Conventional statistics were used to study the variability of the soils in Hell Hook marsh along the Chesapeake Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland. Analysis of variance and least significant difference test suggested that the differentiating characteristics and the accessory physical and chemical properties were significantly different among three pedons located 20 m apart. The spatial distribution of the mean coefficient of variation demonstrated that the spatial variability of organic carbon and total sulfur within a pedon is random rather than systematic. The magnitude of variability among and within pedons substantiates the importance of establishing a feasible sampling protocol. However, because of the great variability of tidal marsh soils, there is often the need to balance the desire for high confidence level and accuracy with the need for a reasonable sampling protocol. This was accomplished by accepting an 80% confidence level and 20% accuracy rather than more rigorous estimates and was achieved by making a single observation to estimate the thickness of the organic horizon and by collecting three samples, on average, within 1 to 2 m to estimate total sulfur and organic carbon.

AB  - Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as 'blue carbon' ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 +/- 22 Mg C-org ha(-1)), seagrass (76 +/- 20 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (76 +/- 23 Mg C-org ha(-1)). We recorded a 38% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed Pb-210 dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)), followed by seagrass (9 g G(org) m(-2) yr(-1)) and saltmarshes (8 g C-org m(-2) yr(-1)). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.

AB  - The distribution of mercury and methylmercury (MeHg) in sediment, mudflats, and marsh soils of the Hg-contaminated tidal Penobscot River was investigated, along with biogeochemical controls on production. Average total Hg in surface samples (0-3 cm) ranged from 100 to 1200 ng/g; average MeHg ranged from 5 to 50 ng/g. MeHg was usually highest at or near the surface except in highly mobile mudflats. Although total Hg concentrations in the Penobscot are elevated, it is the accumulation of MeHg that stands out in comparison to other ecosystems. Surface soils in the large Mendall Marsh, about 17 km downstream from the contamination source, contained particularly high %MeHg (averaging 8%). In Mendall marsh soil porewaters, MeHg often accounted for more than half of total Hg.
   Salt marshes are areas of particular concern in the Penobscot River, for they are depositional environments for a Hg-contaminated mobile pool of river sediment, hot spots for net MeHg production, and sources of risk to marsh animals. We hypothesized that exceptionally low mercury partitioning between the solid and aqueous phases (with log Kd averaging similar to 4.5) drives high MeHg in Penobscot marshes. The co-occurrence of iron and sulfide in filtered soil porewaters, sometimes both above 100 mu M, suggests the presence of nanoparticulate and/or colloidal metal sulfides. These colloids may be stabilized by high concentrations of aromatic and potentially sulfurized dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marsh soils. Thus, Hg in Penobscot marsh soils appears to be in a highly available for microbial methylation through the formation of DOM-associated HgS complexes. Additionally, low partitioning of MeHg to marsh soils suggests high MeHg bioavailability to animals. Overall, drivers of high MeHg in Penobscot marshes include elevated Hg in soils, low partitioning of Hg to solids, high Hg bioavailability for methylation, rapidly shifting redox conditions in surface marsh soils, and high rates of microbial activity.

AB  - In salt marshes, most biomass plus large reserves of biologically important N, P, Fe, and S are sequestered below ground under saline, waterlogged, and anaerobic conditions. Thus, hydrologic alterations such as diking and ditch drainage that reduce salinity and increase peat aeration can cause radical changes in the composition of salt marsh soils.
   Experimental short-term desalination and drainage of salt marsh cores in greenhouse microcosms caused Spartina production to increase after one growing season, reflecting decreased salt stress and sulfide toxicity. However, production thereafter declined, likely due to pyrite oxidation and acidification in drained treatments and sulfide accumulation in waterlogged treatments.
   A survey of longer-term (decadal) effects of diking on pear composition of Cape God, Massachusetts, USA, marshes revealed acidification, Fe(II) mobilization, and decreased organic content in drained sites. Despite the aerobic decomposition of organic matter, abundant nutrients remained as sorbed NH4 and mineral-bound PO4. In diked, seasonally waterlogged sites, porewater alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium and orthophosphate were much lower, and organic solids higher, than in adjacent natural marsh.
   Seawater was added to cores from diked marshes to study the effects of tidal restoration. Salination of the drained peat increased porewater pH, alkalinity ammonium, orthophosphate, Fe, and Al; copious ammonium N, and Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation favored Spartina growth. Salination of diked-waterlogged peat increased sulfate reduction and caused 6-8 cm of sediment subsidence. The resulting increase in porewater sulfides and waterlogging decreased vigor of transplanted Spartina alterniflora. Results indicate that seawater restoration should proceed cautiously to avoid nutrient loading of surface waters in drained sites or sulfide toxicity in diked-waterlogged marshes.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate soil denitrifying bacterial and fungal community structures and potential denitrification rates in the coastal marsh soils of Eastern China across Spartina alterniflora invasive gradients (i.e. native (Nat), native-Spartina coexisted (Ecot) and Spartina-dominated (Mono) vegetations, respectively). Plant biomass and soil chemical properties were also analyzed to understand the patterns of spatial variability of structure and function of denitrifier communities across the studied gradients. Results indicated that total, bacterial and fungal potential denitrification rates (TDR, BDR and FDR) were 5.5, 3.5 and 1.5 times greater respectively in the Mono soil than in the Nat soil. Denitrifying bacterial richness, evenness and alpha-diversity were 2.0, 1.3 and 1.3 times greater in the Mono soil than those in the Nat soil, while only the richness among denitrifying fungal community parameters was 1.4 times greater in the Mono soil than that in the Nat soil. Plant biomass, soil organic carbon and pH were the most important factors influencing denitrifying bacterial and fungal community structures and functions. Denitrifying bacterial community composition was related closely to BDR and TDR, while denitrifying fungal community composition was not related to FDR and TDR, thus showing that the denitrifying bacterial community is a better predictor of denitrification function following Spartina invasion.

AB  - There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating 'blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon within
   Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge.
   We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.

AB  - In the past century, loading of terrestrial inorganic nitrogen to coastal receiving waters has increased dramatically. Salt marshes, because of their location between upland regions and coastal waters and their recognized role as nutrient transformers, have the potential to ameliorate some of this loading. In the current study, we used core incubations in the laboratory to investigate denitrification rates in high marsh soils from five fringing salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA. The marshes showed a wide variety of terrestrial N loading, with rates ranging from 2 to 6037 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Field-collected cores were selected to include both vegetated and bare soils at each marsh, and the six-hour incubations were designed to approximate natural tidal rhythms. Total dissolved nitrogen flux in these marshes ranged between + 1255 and -710 mumol N m(-2) hr(-1), with N-2 gas accounting for the majority of the total N flux (average 76%). Nitrogen gas flux ranged between -375 (nitrogen fixation) and +420 (denitrification) mumol N-2 m(-2) hr(-1). While N-2 gas fluxes were significantly correlated (r = +0.64, p < 0.05) with marsh organic carbon content, we also detected a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.91, P < 0.05) between average N-2 gas fluxes and terrestrial nitrogen loads. Comparison of N-2 gas fluxes in vegetated vs. bare soils indicated a significant (p < 0.05) but variable effect of vegetation on N-2 flux. This field survey shows the potential of New England fringe salt marshes to intercept and transform land-derived nitrogen loads; however, sediment characteristics (e.g., percent of labile organic matter) and plant community structure can significantly affect the capacity of the marsh to process inorganic nitrogen loads. In order to understand the role of salt marshes in buffering coastal N loading, we need a better understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors controlling denitrification and net N losses.

AB  - Wetland condition can be severely altered as a result of a change in hydrology. In this study, we examined several soil-based methods to quantify and assess changes in salt marsh condition as a result of tidal restriction. Soil properties were compared between two tidally restricted and two (paired) unrestricted salt marshes. Organic horizon morphology provided a qualitative metric of marsh peat decomposition. Quantitative measures of the degree of decomposition included stable plant fragment content and bearing capacity. Soil pH provided simple metrics of changes in soil chemistry. Bulk density was measured to estimate marsh peat collapse and soil organic matter content provided a measure of carbon dynamics. Neither marsh showed significant differences in soil organic matter or bulk density relative to their paired reference marsh. In contrast, soil pH, stable plant fragment content, and bearing capacity were significantly different between restricted and reference marshes. With the exception of incubation pH, these soil properties can be simply and rapidly measured in the field to quantify physical, chemical, and biological changes in the wetland condition of salt marshes as a result of tidal restriction. Further studies should be conducted to develop a rapid protocol for measuring incubation pH in the field.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe.

AB  - We investigated the ecological parameter reductions (termed "similitudes") and characteristic patterns of the net uptake fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in coastal salt marshes using dimensional analysis method from fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering. Data collected during May-October, 2013 from four salt marshes in Waquoit Bay and adjacent estuary, Massachusetts, USA were utilized to evaluate the theoretically-derived dimensionless flux and various ecological driver numbers. Two meaningful dimensionless groups were discovered as the light use efficiency number (LUE=CO2 normalized by photosynthetically active radiation) and the biogeochemical number (combination of soil temperature, porewater salinity, and atmospheric pressure). A semi-logarithmic plot of the dimensionless numbers indicated the emergence of a characteristic diagram represented by three distinct LUE regimes (high, transitional, and low). The high regime corresponded to the most favorable (high temperature and low salinity) condition for CO2 uptake, whereas the low regime represented an unfavorable condition (low temperature and high salinity). The analysis identified two environmental thresholds (soil temperature similar to 17 degrees C and salinity similar to 30 ppt), which dictated the regime transitions of CO2 uptake. The process diagram and critical thresholds provide important insights into the CO2 uptake potential of coastal wetlands in response to changes in key environmental drivers.

AB  - Blue carbon is the organic carbon in oceanic and coastal ecosystems that is captured on centennial to millennial timescales. Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.

AB  - At least 100 fish species are known to be present in the intertidal areas (estuaries, mud flats and salt marshes) of Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France). Between March 1996 and April 1999, 120 tides were sampled in an intertidal salt marsh creek. A total of 31 species were caught. This community was largely dominated by mullets (Liza ramada represents 87% of the total biomass) and sand gobies (Pomatoschistus minutus and P. lozanoi represent 82% of the total numbers). These species, along with Gasterosteus aculeatus, Syngnathus rostellatus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Mugil spp., Liza aurata and Sprattus sprattus, were the most frequent species. In Europe, salt marshes and their creeks are flooded only during high spring tides. So, fishes only invade this environment during short immersion periods, and no species can be considered as marsh resident.
   The salt marsh was colonised by fish every time the tide reached the creek, and during the short time of flood. dominant fish feed actively and exploit the high productivity. The mullet diet was composed of a mixture of sediment, salt marsh detritus. micro-benthic invertebrates and benthic diatoms. Gobies and sea bass (D. labrax) mainly feed on macroinvertebrates, and especially on Orchestia gammarellus, a salt marsh resident crustacean. These fish communities appear to be transporters of organic matter from salt marshes to coastal marine waters. They could play a significant role in the global energy budgets of coastal environments such as Mont Saint-Michel Bay. Moreover, we have shown that salt marshes seem to enable an important part of growth of young of the year sea bass (between 40 to 60% of their growth). These results confirm that this kind of wetland plays important trophic and nursery roles for these species. Differences in densities and population structure of these species into Mont Saint-Michel systems (tidal mud flats, estuaries and tidal salt marshes) can reduce the trophic competition.
   However, in Mont Saint-Michel Bay, ewes intensively graze three-quarters of salt marsh areas. This grazing has caused important impacts on the habitat structure, especially for O. gammarellus. In these areas, this crustacean is replaced by other food items that are less consumed by fish. Consequently, the trophic and nursery roles of European salt marshes for fishes are reduced. This example illustrates that management of wetlands to promote one component of their biota or use involves reductions in other species and functions.

AB  - Invasion of an exotic C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora has been shown to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations in native C-3 plant-dominated coastal wetlands of China. However, little is known about the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC concentrations and fractions in tidal marshes dominated by native C-4 plants. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in a tidal marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant Cyperus malaccensis in the Minjiang River estuary, China. Concentrations of SOC and liable SOC fractions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), were measured in the top 50-cm soils of the C. malaccensis community, as well as those of three S. alterniflora communities with an invasion duration of 0-4 years (SA-4), 4-8 years (SA-8), and 8-12 years (SA-12), respectively. Results showed that both SOC stocks in the 50-cm soils and mean SOC concentrations in the surface soils (0-10 cm) of the C. malaccensis community increased with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion, whereas SOC concentrations in the 10-50-cm soils decreased slightly during the initial period of S. alterniflora invasion, before increasing again. The pattern of changes in labile SOC fractions (DOC, MBC, and EOC) with invasion duration was generally similar to that of SOC, while the ratios of labile SOC fractions to total SOC (DOC:SOC, MBC:SOC, and EOC:SOC) decreased significantly with the duration of S. alterniflora invasion. The findings of this study suggest that invasion of the exotic C-4 plant S. alterniflora into a marsh dominated by the native C-4 plant C. malaccensis would enhance SOC sequestration owing to the greater amount of biomass and lower proportion of labile SOC fractions present in the S. alterniflora communities.

AB  - Prescribed fire in tidal marshes has been shown to generate short-term increases in plant-available nutrients, but the long-term implications of fire on nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition have not been well established. Two manipulative experiments were conducted over 1 yr within long-term annual burn and no-burn blocks at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Cambridge, MD to study the effects of canopy removal and ash deposition on nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition rates following burning. Ash deposition had no significant effects on study variables. At no-burn sites, porewater NH4+ and PO43+ were significantly lower in July in sites with canopy removal (0.15 mg NH4+ L-1 and 0.04 mg PO43+ L-1) compared to sites with a canopy (0.73 mg NH4+ L-1 and 0.08 mg PO43+ L-1). Similar results were found through a canopy replacement treatment at annual burn sites. Decreased porewater NH4+ and PO43+ corresponded to increased total biomass nutrient content. No-burn sites with canopy removal treatments showed significantly lower organic matter decomposition rates than did treatments with a canopy in July (66.5 vs. 74.1% cotton tensile strength loss), corresponding to decreases in porewater NH4+ and PO43+. Plant ash provided a fertilizer pulse of 0.22 g N m(-2) and 0.16 g P m(-2), which were amounts of N and P likely too small to increase plant productivity when deposited during late winter/early spring. Prescribed fire appears to affect nutrient availability and organic matter decomposition in these marsh soils primarily through the mechanism of increased biomass production due to canopy removal.

AB  - Salt marshes are very important areas for biogeochemical cycling, sediment accretion, pollution filtration and retention and erosion and stabilization of the river margins. The high organic matter content in the salt marsh plant sediments along with the radial oxygen diffusion provided by these halophyte root systems gather the ideal conditions for the development of a microbial rhizosphere community. Due to the quick feedback of the microbial communities to an environmental change, these organisms become important monitors for environmental impact assessment. A Salt marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) that reflected physical-chemical and microbial parameters was applied to plant rhizosphere sediments of five salt marshes from three important water bodies from Portugal. The SSMI revealed to be plant-independent evaluating efficiently the different marshes according to their maturity degree and disturbance influence. Mature salt marshes SSMI classification grouped all the systems at this development stage, while the younger salt marshes are classified in different groups according to their evolution degree. Also the impact degree is reflected at this level discriminating also the more adversely impacted salt marshes. Being a multi-metric index, the SSMI sub-metrics are also susceptible of ecological interpretation, giving important backstage information about the underlying biogeochemical cycling processes.

AB  - Background
   Saltmarshes are extremely valuable but often overlooked ecosystems, contributing to livelihoods locally and globally through the associated ecosystem services they provide, including fish production, carbon storage and coastal protection. Despite their importance, knowledge of the current spatial distribution (occurrence and extent) of saltmarshes is incomplete. In light of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures on coastal ecosystems, global data on the occurrence and extent of saltmarshes are needed to draw attention to these critical ecosystems and to the benefits they generate for people. Such data can support resource management, strengthen decision-making and facilitate tracking of progress towards global conservation targets set by multilateral environmental agreements, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the United Nations' (UN's) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Ramsar Convention.
   New information
   Here, we present the most complete dataset on saltmarsh occurrence and extent at the global scale. This dataset collates 350,985 individual occurrences of saltmarshes and presents the first global estimate of their known extent.
   The dataset captures locational and contextual data for saltmarsh in 99 countries worldwide. A total of 5,495,089 hectares of mapped saltmarsh across 43 countries and territories are represented in a Geographic Information Systems polygon shapefile. This estimate is at the relatively low end of previous estimates (2.2-40 Mha), however, we took the conservative approach in the mapping exercise and there are notable areas in Canada, Northern Russia, South America and Africa where saltmarshes are known to occur that require additional spatial data. Nevertheless, the most extensive saltmarsh worldwide are found outside the tropics, notably including the low-lying, ice-free coasts, bays and estuaries of the North Atlantic which are well represented in our global polygon dataset. Therefore, despite the gaps, we believe that, while incomplete, our global polygon data cover many of the important areas in Europe, the USA and Australia.

AB  - Tidal wetlands, the global hotspots of biodiversity and carbon stocks, are currently experiencing widespread modifications in their composition due to human disturbances and changing climate. Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub -continental-or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.

AB  - In order to maintain an elevation in the intertidal zone at which marsh vegetation can survive, vertical accretion of the marsh surface must take place at a rate at least equal to the rate of relative sea-level rise. Net vertical accretion of coastal marshes is a result of interactions between tidal imports, vegetation and depositional processes. All of these factors are affected, directly or indirectly, by alterations in marsh hydrology which might occur as a result of sea-level rise. The overall response of coastal marshes to relative sea-level rise depends upon the relative importance of the inorganic and organic components of the marsh soil and the impact of increased hydroperiod on net accumulation. The varied combination of factors contributing to sediment supply, and their complexity at the scale of individual marshes, means that predicting the response of suspended sediment concentration in marsh floodwater to any changes which may occur as a result of sealevel rise, at anything other than the local scale is unlikely to be accurate. The impact of sea-level rise on net below-ground production is also complex. The sensitivity of certain species to waterlogging and soil chemical changes could result in a change in species composition or the migration of vegetation zones. Consequently, predicting the net impact of sea-level rise on organic matter accumulation is fraught with difficulties and requires improved understanding of interactions between vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes.

AB  - Isles Dernieres is a transgressive barrier island arc in southeast Louisiana associated with the Bayou Grand Caillou headland of the Lafourche delta complex, which was abandoned 600 to 800 years ago. During the past two decades Trinity and Whiskey Islands have been eroding at rates of >18 m/y, and East Island has been eroding at a rate of 11.8 m/y. The Isles Dernieres Barrier Island Stabilization Project, implemented in 1998, dredged material from various sites in the bay behind the barriers for dune and marsh restoration of East, Trinity, and Whiskey Islands. The 1998 restoration increased the overall height and width of the islands but marsh habitat has not developed on the restored material behind the barriers. This study characterizes the physical and chemical properties of soil from restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh on Isles Dernieres to determine the restoration timeframe in which restored marsh soils develop to conditions more similar to natural marsh soils. Additionally, the goal is to identify the soil properties in restored marsh that could be modified to enhance back-barrier marsh habitat.
   Laboratory analyses of 60 cores from four different vegetation density classes in restored marsh and nine cores from natural marshes included bulk density, soil moisture content, grain size, sorting, pH, conductivity, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Vegetation density in restored marshes had no significant effect on soil properties, with the exception of bulk density. Marsh type had a significant effect on all measured soil properties. Variations in the soil properties of restored and natural back-barrier salt marsh are primarily the result of differences in soil texture and elevation.

AB  - Coastal wetland biomass is an important indicator of wetland productivity, carbon storage, health, and vulnerability to climate change. The ability to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in wetlands at ecologically relevant scales is complicated by the spatial variability inherent to patterns in wetland vegetation and the biogeomorphic processes that help create them. Remote sensing provides an approach for mapping wetland biomass, but the spatial resolutions of satellite and airborne imagery often constrain the types of ecological patterns and processes that can be detected. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have previously been used to capture fine-scale (<= 1 m) variability in AGB in coastal wetland settings. However, it remains unclear if a UAV approach to estimating wetland biomass is transferrable across diverse wetland sites or how it compares to commonly used satellite-based approaches. Here, we test the capabilities of UAVs in remotely quantifying AGB and compare biomass estimation using UAV and Landsat satellite imagery (30 m resolution) in several wetland sites in Southern California. Field surveys highlight significant spatial variability in wetland plant community AGB and height that influence remote biomass estimation. Relationships between UAV vegetation indices and AGB were site-specific and influenced by vegetation types. Biomass estimation using UAVs (r(2) = 0.40, RMSE = 534.6 g m(-2)) showed better correlation with NDVI than a Landsatbased approach (r(2) = 0.26, RMSE = 596.8 g m(-2)). We found combining high-resolution UAV AGB maps and Landsat NDVI to develop AGB models showed the highest correlation (r(2) = 0.45, RMSE = 659.7 g m(-2)) and provided additional spatial information to aid scaling field data to satellite imagery. Overall, UAVs captured more spatial complexity in aboveground biomass at finer scales than is possible with moderate-resolution Landsat pixels, indicating that UAVs can be used to characterize patterns of within-marsh variability resulting from local-scale (<= 100s of meters) ecological processes.

Understanding natural ecosystems and the way in which ecosystem engineers shape the environment is important to ecological restoration based on key ecosystem processes. Increasing studies has shown that crabs in intertidal salt marsh can act as ecosystem engineers, affecting the geomorphological processes and spatial heterogeneity of tidal flat. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore how crab burrowing activity affects intertidal microtopography and soil carbon and nitrogen in the intertidal salt marshes. The results showed that crab burrowing activity is one of the key factors influencing concave-convex microtopography, which could intercept plant detritus and subsequently influencing the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen. When compared to areas of flat microtopography with few or no crab burrows, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil inorganic carbon content (SIC), total carbon content (TC), and total nitrogen content (TN) in adjacent areas of concave-convex micro topography with high density crab burrows were all significantly higher. Artificial simulation of ecosystem engineering processes could also change the geomorphological features of tidal flats and improve the retention and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, which could also attract more crabs to burrow and settle down, then generate and maintain the concave-convex microtopography. Taken together, the results of this study provide scientific and effective implication and guidance for the restoration of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - The Bay of Cadiz is surrounded by a broad zone of salt marshes that exchange water through a seawater channel 18 km in length (the Sancti Petri Channel). These littoral zones are characterized by their extreme shallowness (with a mean depth of less than 1 m) and their high content of organic matter, which in relative terms is highest in the surface sediments (between 1.2% and 2.6% organic carbon). Under these conditions, an intensive benthic regeneration of nutrients takes place, with mean fluxes in the zone of 83.2 +/- 36.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of inorganic carbon, 6.36 +/- 4.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of NH4+, 1.14 +/- 0.56 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of HPO42- and 4.54 +/- 2.25 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of SiO2. A proportion of these nutrients and inorganic carbon produced make their way through secondary channels to the Sancti Petri Channel, and the material is later transported by the tides to the Bay of Cadiz and other bordering littoral zones. In this work, the concentrations of inorganic carbon and nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, HPO42- and SiO2) have been determined at three different depths, every hour, during complete tidal cycles. Simultaneously, the current velocities at different depths have been measured continuously. From this set of experimental data, calculations have been made of the evolution of the instantaneous velocities of these substances at each end of the channel, and by integration, the net balance for the complete tidal cycle. In general terms, there is an export of inorganic carbon and nutrients with the tides, although the net transports are very variable and depend to a large extent on the hydrodynamics of the zone. The results obtained correlate with balances previously made in the Bay of Cadiz.

AB  - We studied the ecological resilience of salt marshes by deriving sea level rise (SLR) thresholds in two estuaries with contrasting upland hydrological inputs in the north-central Gulf of Mexico: Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) with limited upland input, and the Pascagoula River delta drained by the Pascagoula River, the largest unclaimed river in the continental United States. We applied a mechanistic model to account for vegetation responses and hydrodynamics to predict salt marsh distributions under future SLR scenarios. We further investigated the potential mechanisms that contribute to salt marsh resilience to SLR.
   The modeling results show that salt marshes in the riverine dominated estuary are more resilient to SLR than in the marine dominated estuary with SLR thresholds of 10.3 mm/yr and 7.2 mm/yr respectively. This difference of >3 m m/yr is mainly contributed by larger quantities of riverine-borne mineral sediments in the Pascagoula River. In both systems, sediment trapping by the above-ground vegetation appears to contribute more to marsh platform accretion than organic matter from below-ground biomass based on the medians of the accretion rates. However, below-ground biomass could contribute up to 90% of accretion in the marine dominated estuary compared to only 60% of accretion in the riverine dominated estuary. SLR thresholds of salt marshes are more sensitive to vegetation biomass in the marine dominated estuary while biomass and sediment similarly affect SLR thresholds of salt marshes in the riverine dominated estuary.
   This research will likely help facilitate more informed decisions on conservation/restoration policies for these two types of systems in the near-term needed to minimize future catastrophic loss of these coastal marsh habitats once SLR thresholds are exceeded.

AB  - The recent expansion of Phragmites australis (common reed) from the marsh-upland interface into high marsh zones provides an opportunity to assess the impact of individual plant species on biomass production and decomposition in salt marshes. Seasonal harvests of aboveground and belowground biomass demonstrate that annual production of P. australis is approximately three times greater for aboveground biomass, two times greater for belowground biomass, and 30% lower in root: shoot ratio than neighboring populations of S. patens. Whole-plant litter (stems and leaves) also decomposes at a much slower annual rate for P. australis (k = 0.25) than S patens litter (k = 0.57). By crossing litter type with site of litter decomposition, I found these plant species to influence decay rates through litter type and not through their effects on marsh surface conditions (e.g., temperature, sedimentation rates). Based on these calculations, annual rates of carbon accumulation in the peat of high marshes are likely to increase 5-fold once P. australis becomes established due to its greater rates of biomass production and residence time in infrequently flooded brackish marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes provide a bulwark against sea-level rise (SLR), an interface between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, important nursery grounds for many species, a buffer against extreme storm impacts, and vast blue carbon repositories. However, salt marshes are at risk of loss from a variety of stressors such as SLR, nutrient enrichment, sediment deficits, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbances. Determining the dynamics of salt marsh change with remote sensing requires high temporal resolution due to the spectral variability caused by disturbance, tides, and seasonality. Time series analysis of salt marshes can broaden our understanding of these changing environments. This study analyzed aboveground green biomass (AGB) in seven mid-Atlantic Hydrological Unit Code 8 (HUC-8) watersheds. The study revealed that the Eastern Lower Delmarva watershed had the highest average loss and the largest net reduction in salt marsh AGB from 1999-2018. The study developed a method that used Google Earth Engine (GEE) enabled time series of the Landsat archive for regional analysis of salt marsh change and identified at-risk watersheds and salt marshes providing insight into the resilience and management of these ecosystems. The time series were filtered by cloud cover and the Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII). The combination of GEE enabled Landsat time series, and TMII filtering demonstrated a promising method for historic assessment and continued monitoring of salt marsh dynamics.

AB  - Saline coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and coastal salt marsh, provide many ecosystem services. In Australia, large areas have been lost since European colonization, particularly as a result of drainage, infilling and flood-mitigation works, often starting in the mid-19th century and aimed primarily towards converting land to agricultural, urban or industrial uses. These threats remain ongoing, and will be exacerbated by rapid population growth and climate change in the 21st century. Establishing the effect of wetland loss on the delivery of ecosystem services is confounded by the absence of a nationally consistent approach to mapping wetlands and defining the boundaries of different types of coastal wetland. In addition, climate change and its projected effect on mangrove and salt marsh distribution and ecosystem services is poorly, if at all, acknowledged in existing legislation and policy. Intensifying climate change means that there is little time to be complacent; indeed, there is an urgent need for proper valuation of ecosystem services and explicit recognition of ecosystem services within policy and legislation. Seven actions are identified that could improve protection of coastal wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide, including benchmarking and improving coastal wetland extent and health, reducing complexity and inconsistency in governance arrangements, and facilitating wetland adaptation and ecosystem service delivery using a range of relevant mechanisms. Actions that build upon the momentum to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon 'blue carbon' could achieve multiple desirable objectives, including clithate-change mitigation and adaptation, floodplain rehabilitation and habitat protection.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are dynamic, intertidal ecosystems that are increasingly being recognised for their contributions to ecosystem services, including carbon (C) accumulation and storage. The survival of salt marshes and their capacity to store C under rising sea levels, however, is partially reliant upon sedimentation rates and influenced by a combination of physical and biological factors. In this study, we use several complementary methods to assess short-term (days) deposition and medium-term (months) accretion dynamics within a single marsh that contains three salt marsh vegetation types common throughout southeastern (SE) Australia.
   We found that surface accretion varies among vegetation assemblages, with medium-term (19 months) bulk accretion rates in the upper marsh rush (Juncus) assemblage (1.74 +/- 0.13 mm yr(-1)) consistently in excess of estimated local sea-level rise (1.15 mm yr(-1)). Accretion rates were lower and less consistent in both the succulent (Sarcocornia, 0.78 +/- 0.18 mm yr(-1)) and grass (Sporobolus, 0.88 +/- 0.22 mm yr(-1)) assemblages located lower in the tidal frame. Short-term (6 days) experiments showed deposition within Juncus plots to be dominated by autochthonous organic inputs with C deposition rates ranging from 1.14 +/- 0.41 mg C cm(-2) d(-1) (neap tidal period) to 2.37 +/- 0.44 mg C cm(-2) d(-1) (spring tidal period), while minerogenic inputs and lower C deposition dominated Sarcocornia (0.10 +/- 0.02 to 0.62 +/- 0.08 mg C cm(-2) d(-1)) and Sporobolus (0.17 +/- 0.04 to 0.40 +/- 0.07 mg C cm(-2) d(-1)) assemblages.
   Elemental (C : N), isotopic (delta C-13), mid-infrared (MIR) and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses revealed little difference in either the source or character of materials being deposited among neap versus spring tidal periods. Instead, these analyses point to substantial redistribution of materials within the Sarcocornia and Sporobolus assemblages, compared to high retention and preservation of organic inputs in the Juncus assemblage. By combining medium-term accretion quantification with short-term deposition measurements and chemical analyses, we have gained novel insights into above-ground biophysical processes that may explain previously observed regional differences in surface dynamics among key salt marsh vegetation assemblages. Our results suggest that Sarcocornia and Sporobolus assemblages may be particularly susceptible to changes in sea level, though quantification of below-ground processes (e.g. root production, compaction) is needed to confirm this.

AB  - The effect of time on natural regeneration of two salt marshes was studied in relation to plant and edaphic factors. The study was carried out in two naturally restoring salt marshes, differing in restoration time, in Txingudi (Bay of Biscay). After 20 yr, the younger salt marsh had the same plant species richness and high species similarity as a 35 yr old salt marsh (17 and 16, respectively, similarity index = 0.9), but both sites had lower species richness and similarity than a nearby natural salt marsh (36 plant species and similarity indices of 0.45 with the 35 yr old marsh and 0.46 with the 20 yr old marsh). Plant species present in the two recovering salt marshes followed a similar distribution pattern in relation to organic matter, conductivity and moisture content although this zonation differed from the natural salt marsh. The range of edaphic factors measured was also similar, but differed from those in the natural salt marsh. The process of plant species recolonization and spatial distribution might be delayed by a low probability of species arrival and by the time need for the restoration of hydrologic and edaphic factors. This study supports the necessity of long-term monitoring in measuring coastal salt marsh restoration.

AB  - Salt marshes provide storm protection to shorelines, sequester carbon (C), and mitigate coastal eutrophication. These valuable coastal ecosystems are confronted with increasing nitrogen (N) inputs from anthropogenic sources, such as agricultural runoff, wastewater, and atmospheric deposition. To inform predictions of salt marsh functioning and sustainability in the future, we characterized the response of a variety of plant, microbial, and sediment responses to a seven-level gradient of N addition in three Californian salt marshes after 7 and 14 months of N addition. The marshes showed variable responses to the experimental N gradient that can be grouped as neutral (root biomass, sediment respiration, potential carbon mineralization, and potential net nitrification), linear (increasing methane flux, decreasing potential net N mineralization, and increasing sediment inorganic N), and nonlinear (saturating aboveground plant biomass and leaf N content, and exponentially increasing sediment inorganic and organic N). The three salt marshes showed quantitative differences in most ecosystem properties and processes rates; however, the form of the response curves to N addition were generally consistent across the three marshes, indicating that the responses observed may be applicable to other marshes in the region. Only for sediment properties (inorganic and organic N pool) did the shape of the response differ significantly between marshes. Overall, the study suggests salt marshes are limited in their ability to sequester C and N with future increases in N, even without further losses in marsh area.

AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or "blue carbon" systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

AB  - Mangroves are rapidly being lost to deforestation in many locations while expanding their areal extent in other subtropical and temperate regions. Currently, there is a paucity of information on how these changes may alter the carbon accumulation capacity of coastal areas. Here, sediment cores were collected from two areas and used to determine the influence of mangrove migration and deforestation on sediment carbon stocks and accumulation rates. The deforested area contained lower sedimentary organic carbon stocks (2767 +/- 580 g m(-2)) compared to the preserved area (6949 +/- 84 g m(-2)). Sediment accumulation rates, derived from excess Pb-210 and Pu239+240 depositional signatures, ranged from 0.19 to 0.35 cm yr(-1). The total sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) accumulation rates for the period after mangrove deforestation (2005-2011) exhibited significant differences between preserved areas (Core C: 43.9 +/- 6.9 g m(-2) yr(-1); Core D: 83.1 +/- 5.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and the deforested area (Core B: 25.8 +/- 6.0 g m(-2) yr(-1)), suggesting a decline after deforestation. For the preserved area, the TOC accumulation under mangrove dominance (65.5 +/- 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1), after 1944) was higher than under saltmarsh dominance (23.5 +/- 15.9 g m(-2) yr(-1,) before 1944), as revealed by carbon isotopic signatures (delta C-13). The increase in the TOC accumulation due to mangrove expansion in this New Zealand estuary was conservatively estimated as three-fold higher, and two-fold higher in stocks in comparison to the period when this ecosystem was dominated by non-mangrove vegetation.

AB  - The extensive loss of tidal marsh habitat surrounding the San Francisco Bay has led to numerous restoration projects to restore ecosystem function. Native cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) is important for sediment accumulation and nesting habitat for endangered California Ridgway's Rail (Rallus obsoletus obsoletus), and because salt marshes are typically nitrogen-limited ecosystems, previous restoration studies in California have used nitrogen fertilizers to increase plant growth. This study compared the use of two low-nitrogen, high-carbon fertilizers (Macrosystis pyrifera (kelp) and sodium alginate) to stimulate N-2-fixing bacteria inhabiting the S. foliosa rhizosphere in a historic and recently restored marsh in San Francisco Bay. Alginate increased N-2-fixation, though there was no observed S. foliosa growth response. Kelp suppressed N-2-fixation, and increased the foliar nitrogen content of Salicornia pacifica in mixed Spartina-Salicornia stands. The restored marsh had less than 0.5 mu M phosphate in porewaters, suggesting phosphorus, not nitrogen, limits S. foliosa growth in this marsh. Alginate increased rates of N-2-fixation and may promote plant growth in marshes exhibiting nitrogen limitation. Phosphate limitation was a surprise considering numerous previous studies indicate nitrogen as the primary limiting nutrient of tidal marsh plants. We recommend first assessing nutrient stoichiometry when considering manipulations to promote plant growth in restored marshes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are known to be efficient carbon sinks due to high rates of primary productivity, carbon burial by mineral sediments, and low rates of sediment organic matter decomposition. Of the three coastal wetland types: tidal marshes, tidal forests, and seagrass meadows, carbon burial by seagrasses is relatively under-studied, and reported rates range widely from 45 to 190 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additionally, most of these seagrass rates are biased toward tropical and subtropical species, particularly Posidonia oceanica, with few focused on Zostera marina, the most widespread species in the northern hemisphere. We measured sediment organic content, carbon content, and long-term accretion rates to estimate organic carbon stocks and sequestration rates for a Z. marina meadow in Padilla Bay, a National Estuarine Research Reserve in Washington. We found rates of carbon sequestration to be quite low relative to commonly reported values, averaging 9 to 11 g C m(-2) yr(-1). We attribute this to both low sediment organic content and low rates of accretion. We postulate here that Padilla Bay's low carbon sequestration capacity may be representative of healthy Z. marina meadows rather than an anomaly, and that Z. marina meadows have an inherently low carbon sequestration capacity because of the species' low tolerance for suspended sediment (which limits light availability) and sediment organic content (which leads to toxic sulfide levels). Further research should focus on measuring carbon sequestration rates from other Z. marina meadows, particularly from sites that exhibit, a priori, the potential for higher rates of carbon sequestration.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted on three different water levels and four salinity levels to investigate the effects of water level and salinity on the total sulfur (TS) content of marsh soil in the Yellow River Delta of China. The total sulfur content of surface and subsurface soils from incubated soil cores were measured under different water and salinity levels on three sampling dates. Our results showed that a higher TS content appeared in surface soils under a 5 cm water level on different sampling dates, of which higher TS content was observed in August (916 mg/kg) and October (1,335 mg/kg) under a 16.7aEuro degrees salinity level. However, a higher TS level (1,167 mg/kg) was observed under a 0.52aEuro degrees salinity level in September. Meanwhile, a lower TS content appeared in subsurface soils under a 10 cm water level at a 10.2aEuro degrees salinity level. The interaction of the water level and salinity had a significant effect on both the TS content and the C/S ratio. The TS content was significantly correlated with soil organic matter. However, a significant correlation between the total sulfur and the C/N ratio was not observed.

AB  - The coastal wetlands of southern Louisiana provide an ideal environment for removing nitrate (NO3-) from the Mississippi River before discharge into the Gulf of Mexico where it can contribute to hypoxia. However, denitrification, the primary mechanism of excess N removal, may be sensitive to the fluctuating salinities that characterize coastal wetlands. Salinity can shift from salt to fresh during river inflows, or from fresh to salt during storm surge events. This study investigated the impact of shifting salinity on potential denitrification rates in marsh soils and bayou sediments from the fresh and salt marshes of Brenton Sound estuary. Potential denitrification rates were quantified using bottle incubations for both short-term (2 d), and longer-term (11 d) studies. Fresh marsh sites had higher denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), but all soils and sediments achieved high denitrification when exposed to ideal conditions. Pulses of freshwater (0 ppt) in salt marsh soils decreased potential denitrification rates by 98% for an 11-d study, indicating the rapid opening of a freshwater diversion could significantly reduce that ability of coastal wetlands to provide significant nutrient-removal before discharge to the coastal ocean. Pulses of intermediate salinity (15 ppt) water stimulated denitrification rates in the fresh marsh soil by 75%, while full salinity seawater (35 ppt) suppressed potential denitrification by 73% for 11 d. This research demonstrates the sensitivity of the denitrifying microbial consortia to rapid shifts in salinity and this information can be used to guide water managers on maximizing NO3- removal in Mississippi River surface water diversions.

AB  - The study aimed to establish the distribution and fate of phosphorus in the soils of a coastal salt marsh affected by mine wastes and wastewater effluents. Water samples from two watercourses were analysed for soluble phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon and soil samples within the marsh were analysed for total P, Fe, N and CaCO3. In addition, a fractionation of the phosphorus was performed. The results indicate that high concentrations of soluble phosphorus (up to 12.3 mg PO43-P L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (up to 36.5 mg L-1) flowed from one of the 4 watercourses into the salt marsh. Organic residual P was the most abundant P form in the soils, constituting between 38.6 and 76.6% of the total P, whereas P associated with humic acids was less abundant (less than 3%). Among the mineral soil components, Ca and Mg compounds were the most active in phosphorus retention (up to 50% of the total P), except in the plots most affected by mine wastes. In the latter sites, the highest Fe (up to 247 g kg(-1)) and the lowest CaCO3 (8.9 g kg(-1)) concentrations were obtained, and Fe- and Al-bound P was the most abundant fraction, reaching 23.9% of the total P. Unusually low total nitrogen/total phosphorus ratios (between 5.4 and 5.7) showed that marsh areas affected by wastewater effluents are acting as phosphorus sinks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Incubation experiments were conducted to determine the influence of natural sunlight irradiation on the release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from resuspended surface sediments. The photo-release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved nitrogen (DN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were quantified over time. During the 5-7-day incubations, 3.4-12.4 and 23-41 % of the sedimentary organic carbon (TOC) and 2.8-10.2 and 25-46 % of the solid phase nitrogen (TN) were released into DOC and DN pools from Florida and Massachusetts salt marsh sediments, respectively. The suspended, fractionated, clay-sized particles from Massachusetts released much higher DOC and DN than Florida bulk sediment. Up to 65 % of the DOC and 100 % of the DN photo-released from sediments were respired rapidly by bacteria, indicating that microorganisms play an important role in regulating the concentration of DOC and DN. The bioavailability of photo-released DOC and DN also depends largely on the biochemical nature of the DOM released from different sediments. Optical measurements confirmed that significant CDOM production was associated with the sunlight-induced DOC release. Photo-released CDOM appeared to be marine and humic-like as characterized by fluorescence and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy. It is estimated that photo-production of DOC from resuspended sediments could account for 10-22 % of the DOC measured in the coastal waters adjacent to the marsh systems studied. These results indicate that production of DOM from resuspended sediments due to direct sunlight irradiation could be an important source of DOC, CDOM, and secondary production in salt marshes and marsh-dominated coastal waters.

AB  - Thin Layer Placement (TLP) is an increasingly used management technique to promote coastal resilience to accelerated sea level rise, but it is unclear how differential thickness of dredged sediment application alters plantsoil carbon dynamics in northeastern Atlantic coast salt marshes. We initiated a field experiment in a microtidal Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) dominated salt marsh in Connecticut (USA) to examine how a silt-loam dredge applied at different thicknesses (low: +5 cm, medium: +10 cm, and high: +15 cm) altered biological and biogeochemical responses. Over two growing seasons we monitored plant responses (above and belowground biomass, stem height, stem density, leaf area) and soil-biogeochemical parameters (EC, pH, redox, NH4+, sulfides, C:N, decomposition, bulk density, carbon fluxes). We found adding 5-7 cm of dredged sediment promoted rapid revegetation, alleviated phytotoxic sulfides, enhanced CO2 uptake, and reduced CH4 emissions. Low treatments reached similar vegetation cover to controls after one growing season, though sediment treatments greater than 10-cm thick showed delayed growth. Low levels of sediment addition stimulated the highest root biomass in the underlying soil, promoting CO2 efflux, but this was offset by aboveground biomass productivity, promoting net CO2 uptake. Phytotoxic sulfides were reduced in all sediment addition treatments, but our data indicate that coastal managers aiming to promote rapid vegetative recovery while increasing elevation in the short term should target conservative depths (< 10 cm) when using fine-grained dredged material. Collectively, our work will guide wetland managers as they develop restoration specifications for perpetuating coastal marshes in the face of rising seas.

AB  - Exotic plant invasion can alter native soil microbial community composition, and further influence the biogeochemical processes. Little information is available about the impacts of the invasion chronosequence of Spartina alterniflora on the dynamics of soil microbial community. Soil microbial community in coastal salt marshes invaded by S. alterniflora and reference wetlands covered by Suaeda salsa were investigated using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) profiling along a short-term chronosequence (i.e., 2-, 5- and 10-year) of S. alterniflora invasion in the Yellow River Estuary. Results exhibited an increase in soil moisture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the total of PLFAs with increasing invasion ages of S. alterntflora in these coastal salt marshes. Comparatively, soil pH and bulk density exhibited a weak decline along the invasion chronosequence. The elevated values of relative abundance of fungi and the ratios of fungi: bacteria (F/B) in all invaded salt marshes were mainly associated with the accumulation of soil available substrate (e.g., SOM, DOC and TN). S. alterniflora invasion also increased the ratios of gram-positive/gram-negative (G+/G-) bacterial PLFAs, with the highest value occurring in the 2-year invaded salt marshes. The bacterial stress indicated by ratios of cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c consistently decreased along the invasion chronosequence. In conclusion, the shifts of soil microbial community composition were tightly associated with soil variables, such as soil pH and soil nutrient supply. Our findings reflect the short-term chronological effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities, which contributes to the linkage between the plant invasion and soil development of coastal salt marshes.

AB  - Mercury adsorption characteristics of Mississippi River deltaic plain (MRDP) freshwater marsh soil in the Louisiana Gulf coast were evaluated under various conditions. Mercury adsorption was well described by pseudo-second order and Langmuir isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacity of 39.8 mg g(-1). Additional fitting of intraparticle model showed that mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was controlled by both external surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion. The partition of adsorbed mercury (mg g-1) revealed that mercury was primarily adsorbed into organic-bond fraction (12.09) and soluble/exchangeable fraction (10.85), which accounted for 63.5% of the total adsorption, followed by manganese oxide-bound (7.50), easily mobilizable carbonate-bound (4.53), amorphous iron oxide-bound (0.55), crystalline Fe oxide-bound (0.41), and residual fraction (0.16). Mercury adsorption capacity was generally elevated along with increasing solution pH even though dominant species of mercury were non-ionic HgCl2, HgClOH and Hg(OH)(2) at between pH 3 and 9. In addition, increasing background NaCl concentration and the presence of humic acid decreased mercury adsorption, whereas the presence of phosphate, sulfate and nitrate enhanced mercury adsorption. Mercury adsorption in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was reduced by the presence of Pb, Cu, Cd and Zn with Pb showing the greatest competitive adsorption. Overall the adsorption capacity of mercury in the MRDP freshwater marsh soil was found to be significantly influenced by potential environmental changes, and such factors should be considered in order to manage the risks associated with mercury in this MRDP wetland for responding to future climate change scenarios.

AB  - Initial pedogenesis of reclaimed saline marsh soils was studied along a chronosequence of reclaimed land at Hangzhou Bay, Zhejiang Province, P.R. China. The objective was to compare soil development of these soils with processes known for natural saline marsh soil development and to evaluate the presented form of artificial land recovery against the background of increasing population densities in China. Electrical conductivity (water) and exchangeable sodium percentage decreased rapidly after reclamation started. The decrease in pH and carbonate content suggest an incipient decalcification. Soil organic carbon decreased in the first 30 cm within 20 years, caused by mineralization of the organic sea sediments. After this process an accumulation of soil organic carbon due to organic matter input as a result of farming was observed. At all sites total contents of calcium, magnesium and potassium were classified as elevated to high and decreased slightly within 31 years after reclamation and commencement of agricultural use. Only total phosphorus increased after construction of embankments, attributed to the application of fertilizer phosphorus. Available nutrient contents developed differently but none showed significant trends. Calcium slightly decreased as an effect of reclamation. Processes of pedogenesis were comparable to those known for natural marshes, but had an initial character. The reclamation of land in the presented manner is considered important to support high and growing population densities in China. However, agricultural management and fertilizer application has to be carefully evaluated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - The age and ability of salt marshes to accumulate and sequester carbon is often assessed using the carbon isotopic signatures (Delta C-14 and delta C-13) of sedimentary organic matter. However, transfers of allochthonous refractory carbon (C-RF) from the watershed to marshes would not represent new C sequestration. To better understand how refractory carbon (C-RF) inputs affect assessments of marsh age and C sequestration, Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of both total organic carbon (TOC), C-RF, and non-C-RF organic matter fractions were measured in salt marshes from four contrasting systems on the North Atlantic coast. To our knowledge, no salt marsh sediment study has considered refractory or allochthonous carbon in carbon budget calculations or the impact on chronologies. Stable and radiogenic isotope data suggest that while TOC was dominated by autochthonous plant inputs, C-RF was dominated by locally recycled or allochthonous C, the delivery of which was controlled by the size and slope of each watershed. Steep-gradient rivers analyzed delivered Delta C-14-depleted C-RF to their estuarine marshes, while the site located in the low-gradient river was associated with larger C-RF content. Finally, the marsh isolated from riverine input contained the least fraction of TOC as C-RF. Laterally transported C-RF caused only a small offset in Delta C-14 in relation to TOC in low-gradient systems (average Delta C-14 offset was -44.4 and -24.2 parts per thousand at each location). However, the presence of allochthonous Delta C-14-depleted C-RF in sediments of steep-gradient rivers led to large overestimates of the time of organic matter deposition (i.e. apparent age was older than the 'true' time of deposition) (Delta C-14 offset ranged from -170.6 to -528.9 parts per thousand). Further, reliance on TOC or loss on ignition analyses to calculate C sequestration by marshes might produce overestimates of at least as much as 10 to 20% since neither account for the lateral transport of allochthonous carbon.

AB  - Salt marshes contribute to climate change mitigation because of their great capacity to store organic matter (OM) in soils. Most of the research regarding OM turnover in salt marshes in times of global change focuses on effects of rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise, while effects of land-use change have gained little attention. The present work investigates the mechanisms by which livestock grazing can affect OM decomposition in salt marsh soils. In a grazing exclusion experiment at the mouth of the Yangtze estuary, China, we assessed soil microbial exo-enzyme activity (EEA) to gain insight into the microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) demand. Additionally, we studied the decomposition of plant litter in soil using the Tea Bag Index (TBI), a widely used standardized litter bag assay to fingerprint soil decomposition dynamics. Based on EEAs, grazing markedly reduced microbial C acquisition, whereas microbial N acquisition was strongly increased. These opposing grazing effects were also evident in the decomposition of standardized plant litter: The decomposition rate constant (k) and the stabilization (S) of litter were not inversely related, as would be expected, but instead both were reduced by livestock grazing. Our data suggest that gazing effects on EEAs and litter decomposition can just partly be explained by grazing-driven soil compaction and resulting lower oxygen availability, which has previously been hypothesized as a main pathway by which grazing can reduce microbial activity in wetland soils. Instead, grazing effects on microbial nutrient demand occurs to be an at least equally important control on soil decomposition processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), as the light absorbing fraction of bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM), plays a number of important roles in the global and local biogeochernical cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in controlling the optical properties of estuarine and coastal waters. Intertidal areas such as salt marshes can contribute significant amounts of the CDOM that is exported to the ocean, but the processes controlling this CDOM source are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the production of DOM and CDOM from the decomposition of two salt marsh cordgrasses, Spartina patens, a C-4 grass, and Typha latifiblia, a C-3 grass, in well-controlled laboratory experiments. During the seven-week incubation period of the salt marsh grasses in oxic and anoxic seawater, changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, dissolved nitrogen (DN) concentrations, stable carbon isotopic composition of DOC (DOC-delta(13) C), and CDOM fluorescence demonstrate a significant contribution of DOC and CDOM to estuarine waters from salt marsh plants, such as Spartina and Typha species. In the natural environment, however, the release processes of CDOM from different cordgrass species could be controlled largely by the in situ oxic and anoxic conditions present during degradation which affects both the production and decomposition of DOC and CDOM, as well as the optical properties of CDOM in estuarine and coastal waters.

AB  - A comparison of a constructed tidal marsh with two adjacent natural tidal marshes was conducted.  The marshes were sampled for fish, shellfish, benthic infauna, marsh surface utilization, vegetation community type, stem density and cover, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, bird utilization, and zooplankton.  The proximity of study sites permitted simultaneous sampling to test for marsh preference by fish and shellfish.  Subsurface organic carbon, Spartina alterniflora stem density, low marsh zone surface utilization, zooplankton abundance and bird nesting sites were all greater in the natural marshes.  Other attributes such as stem density of the high marsh, high marsh zone surface utilization, surface organic carbon, and benthic infauna community structure and abundance were similar between the constructed and natural marshes.  Seasonal differences were observed for fish and shellfish abundance between the constructed and natural marshes.  The study is among the first to use simultaneous sampling techniques to investigate fish and shellfish use between constructed and adjacent natural reference wetlands.

These fires inspire concern about resiliency of ecosystems not adapted to fire, already threatened by sea-level rise (SLR), and under stress from extreme drought. We monitored vegetation percent cover, diversity, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in burned and unburned areas of the salt marsh following the 2013 Camarillo Springs Fire and used remotely sensed Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) analysis to verify the in situ data. Two years following the fire, vegetation percent cover in burned areas was significantly lower than in unburned areas, with dominant-species change in recovered areas, and NDVI was lower than pre-fire conditions. Multi-year disturbance, such as fire, presents challenges for salt marsh resilience and dependent species, especially in sites facing multiple stressors. With anticipated higher temperatures, increased aridity, extreme drought, and higher frequency fires becoming a reality for much of the Pacific coast, this study indicates that fire inSalicornia-dominated marshes is a vulnerability that will need to be addressed differently from other grass- or reed-dominated marsh systems.

AB  - Three adjacent areas in the Urdaibai Estuary (NW Spain) comprising a reclaimed salt marsh, a natural salt marsh and a regenerated salt marsh were sampled in order to study edaphic processes and changes in organic matter (OM) composition related to reclamation and regeneration of soils and sediments in estuarine environments. For this, a general analytical description of the soil and sediment profiles was carried out and the OM was characterized using solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analytical pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The reclaimed salt marsh displayed very different characteristics from the natural salt marsh throughout the whole profile, indicating an important degree of change in soil quality and, particularly, in OM composition caused by the reclamation. At this reclaimed site, characterized by oxic conditions and a lack of tidal influence, transformation of the former salt marsh to grassland resulted in input of OM richer in carbohydrates and with a lower contribution of aromatic compounds than the OM in the salt marsh soils. On the other hand, the edaphic characteristics of the regenerated marsh were similar to those of the natural marsh and the vegetation cover was the same. However, the natural marsh accumulated twice the amount of organic carbon at the surface as the regenerated marsh. Furthermore, the natural marsh contained more aromatic material, as detected with NMR and the Py-GC/MS results indicated a greater presence of microbial material. These differences indicate that the regenerated marsh has not completely recovered its natural characteristics, despite the long period (more than 40 y) since the beginning of the regeneration process. We propose the composition of soil OM as a suitable long term indicator of reclamation and regeneration processes in the salt marsh environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Comparative studies of salt marsh productivity, the pool of nutrients in marsh soils, and the associated fluxes of nutrients, sediments and organic matter have been made in the UK, The Netherlands, Portugal and France. These have shown contrasting relationships between the functional maturity of a marsh and the direction and magnitude of associated fluxes. Actively-extending marshes tend to be flood-dominated systems and net importers of sediment and organic matter, while exporting mineral nutrients. Marshes that are not extending, however, are usually ebb-dominated, net exporters of organic matter and even sediment. These latter marshes can best be regarded as 'mature' or, if they are showing signs of decay, as 'over-mature', in contrast to the 'immature' marshes that are still growing.
   Soil available phosphorus (PO4-P) concentrations measured ranged from 15 to 200 mg/kg, and influenced the primary productivity of the marsh. PO4-P concentrations are themselves partly controlled by the origin and amount of sedimentation on the marsh surface. In contrast, soil inorganic nitrogen showed a strong seasonal trend, with minimum concentrations, related to plant uptake, occurring in early summer.
   The breakdown of organic matter, both above and below the soil surface, appears more rapid in a healthy mature marsh than in a degenerating marsh, and physical processes in the creeks are more pronounced. Low levels of soil microbial activity, immobilization of mineral nitrogen and the slow breakdown of plant litter would seem to characterize degenerating 'over-mature' marshes. Despite these factors, there was little or no difference in the Net Aerial Primary Productivity (300-800 g m(-2) y(-1)) measured at two marshes, one of each type, in the UK.

AB  - Variations in the soil carbon sequestration capability of different types of salt marsh soils at Chongming Dongtan and its influencing factors were studied by analyzing the soil organic carbon (SOC) content, organic matter input and microbial activities. The results indicated that the total SOC content at Area A (southeast of Dongtan, sandy soil with Phragmites communis) was only 46.11% of that of Area B (northeast of Dongtan, clay soil with mixed P. communis and Spartina alterniflora)(P= 0.000 < 0.05), but their organic matter input per year was almost identical. These findings implied that Area B had a lower output of SOC. The microbial biomass at Area A was 3.83 times greater than that at Area B (P= 0.049 < 0.05); the soil catalase and invertase activities at Area A, which were related to carbon metabolism, were 60.31% (P=0.006 < 0.05) and 34.33% (P=0.021 < 0.05) higher than at Area B, respectively; and the soil respiration at Area A was also higher than at Area B. These findings implied that the microbial activities at Area A were greater than those at Area B, and therefore the carbon metabolism was rapid, resulting in increased SOC output at Area A. Increased water content and salinity in the clay soil at Area B may inhibit the microbial activities, thereby reducing the decomposition of the organic matter and enhancing carbon sequestration. In addition, some artificial measures for controlling spread of S. alterniflora at Area B (mowing/digging and tillage (M + D); mowing/digging and tillage/waterlogging (M + D + W)) were found to generally improve the microbial activity of soil, thereby increasing SOC output. However, when the two different physical controlling modes were compared, the SOC and microbial activities of the soil subjected to the M + D + W treatment were relatively high and low, respectively, due to waterlogging restraining the microbial metabolism. These findings indicated that the difference in microbial activities was the important factor leading to variability in the SOC sequestration capability between Areas A and B. Additionally, with the exception of soil texture and vegetation types, environmental conditions and artificial turbulence also influenced microbial activities of soil, and hence SOC output and organic carbon sequestration capability.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that loss of soil organic matter (SOM) from coastal wetlands can contribute to the hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico along the Louisiana coast. In this study, coastal marsh soil profiles of two contrasting basins were investigated for lignin composition in order to assess organic matter source and degradation status under these different wetland formations. The Atchafalaya Basin is undergoing land building whereas the Barataria Basin is experiencing land loss. Lignin monomers were extracted using alkaline CuO oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Marsh soil profiles from the Barataria Basin showed strong lignin storage with two-fold higher lignin contents (sum of vanillyl, syringyl, and cinnamyl phenols, A(8)) than those in the Atchafalaya Basin. Source SOM inputs in the Barataria Basin were non-woody angiosperms, whereas in the Atchafalaya Basin inputs were non-woody angiosperms and some gymnosperm inputs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that different soil environmental factors dominated the status of soil organic matter degradation. Soil pH was negatively related to the lignin degradation in the Atchafalaya Basin, whereas high total N contents inhibited lignin degradation in the Barataria Basin. Increasing electrical conductivity inhibited organic matter degradation in the low salinity wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin, but positively influenced lignin decomposition in the higher salinity marsh soil profiles of Barataria Basin. Despite SOM in the Barataria Basin being more degraded than in the Atchafalaya, the nearly 10-fold greater amount of organic carbon (C) in the Barataria, coupled with net land loss, indicates that it is greater source of oxygen-consuming organic C, thus contributes more to the hypoxia in the Gulf.

AB  - Measurements of aboveground and belowground biomass allocations are important for characterization of structure and function in marsh ecosystems as various processes such as carbon sequestration, gas transport, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem resilience are affected by these allocations. We measured aboveground and belowground biomass, root and rhizome characteristics, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of various tissues of four tidal marsh species in New Jersey by harvesting biomass during peak growing season. The aboveground biomasses for Spartina patens, S. alterniflora, Phragmites australis, and Distichlis spicata were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7 and 1.2 kg m(-2), respectively. The ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass for S. alterniflora and D. spicata, harvested from a recently restored wetland were lower than in previous studies. LAI for S. alterniflora, D. spicata, P. australis, and S. patens were 8.4, 6.8, 4.8 and 3.7 m(2) m(-2), respectively. Diameter of rhizome and root, number of primary roots per node, root surface area to volume ratio, and C/N of various tissues varied with species. The measured above- and belowground biometric traits are crucial for a better understanding of carbon dynamics, and modeling greenhouse gas transport in marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Changing precipitation patterns are predicted to alter ecosystem structure and function with potential carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change. Influenced by both land and sea, salt marshes are unique ecosystems and their productivity and respiration responses to precipitation change differ from those observed in terrestrial ecosystems. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to climate-induced precipitation changes is largely unknown. We conducted 1-year precipitation manipulation experiments in the Spartina patens (high marsh) zone of two salt marshes and quantified ecosystem functions at both and microbial community structure at one. Precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant, although transient, impact on porewater salinity following storms at both sites, but most site conditions (nutrient concentrations, sediment moisture, and temperature) were unaffected. Extreme drought led to a subtle change in microbial community structure, but most ecosystem functions (primary productivity, litter decomposition, and greenhouse gas fluxes) were not affected by precipitation changes. The absence of ecosystem function change indicates functional redundancy (under extreme drought) and resistance (under doubled precipitation and seasonal intensification) exist in the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain function (including ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to resistance, resilience, and functional redundancy in the underlying microbial community.
   Plain Language Summary Precipitation change, especially the intensification of precipitation events (e.g., longer droughts and stronger storms) is an important aspect of human-caused global climate change. Salt marshes are important hotspots for carbon sequestration, so if precipitation changes alter the microbial processes that drive carbon burial and greenhouse gas emissions in salt marshes, there could be an important feedback to the climate system. How salt marsh greenhouse gas fluxes and sediment microbial communities will respond to precipitation changes is largely unknown, so we conducted 1-year precipitation experiments in two salt marshes. We found that precipitation treatments (doubled rainfall, extreme drought, and seasonal intensification) had a significant impact on porewater salinity following storms, and one of the precipitation treatments (extreme drought) led to a subtle change in microbial community structure. However, ecosystem functions including greenhouse gas fluxes were not affected by any precipitation changes, regardless of changes to the microbial community. Our findings demonstrate that salt marsh ecosystems can maintain their functions (including valuable ecosystem services like carbon sequestration) under even the most extreme precipitation change scenarios, due to the stability of the underlying microbial community.

AB  - A growing number of studies have assessed the functional equivalency of restored and natural salt marshes. Several of these have explored the use of functional trajectories to track the increase in restored marsh function over time; however, these studies have disagreed as to the usefulness of such models in long-term predictions of restored marsh development. We compared indicators of four marsh functions (primary production, soil organic matter accumulation, sediment trapping, and maintenance of plant communities) in 6 restored and 11 reference (matched to restored marshes using principal components analysis) salt marshes in the Great Bay Estuary. The restored marshes were all constructed and planted on imported substrate and ranged in age from 1 to 14 years. We used marsh age in a space-for-time substitution to track constructed salt marsh development and explore the use of trajectories. A high degree of variability was observed among natural salt marsh sites, displaying the importance of carefully chosen reference sites. As expected, mean values for constructed site (n = 6) and reference site (n = 11) functions were significantly different. Using constructed marsh age as the independent variable and functional indicator values as dependent variables, nonlinear regression analyses produced several ecologically meaningful trajectories (r (2) > 0.9), demonstrating that the use of different-aged marshes can be a viable approach to developing functional trajectories. The trajectories illustrated that although indicators of some functions (primary production, sediment deposition, and plant species richness) may reach natural site values relatively quickly (<10 years), others (soil organic matter content) will take longer.

AB  - Labile fractions of soil carbon pools are sensitive to environmental changes, which would influence the stabilization of soil carbon. However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.

AB  - In order to elucidate the relationship between sulfate reduction and mineralization of organic matter in coastal sediments, the content of sulfate in sediment samples should be measured. Chloride, sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and phosphate are the standard anions in coastal sediment samples. Ion chromatography (IC) is one of the popularly used techniques for determinations of these anions. However, the peaks of the five anions in the IC system coincide with each other under high chloride conditions when using the normal method. In this article, an improved, highly sensitive method for simultaneous separation and determination of sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and phosphate in the samples with high chloride concentration is established and evaluated by IC. In high concentrations of chloride samples, the effects of eluent concentration on the retention time and separation of other anions are studied. The peaks of these anions can be well separated on an AS11 ion-exchange column by a low concentration of NaOH eluent (10mM). in one injection. Gradient elution is helpful to shorten retention time, especially for phosphate. The method detection limit of sulfate is 0.091mg center dot L1. The recovery of sulfate ranged from 100.5% to 106.8%, when the concentrations of standard solution are close to those of the samples. This technique was validated by determining the content of sulfate and chloride in coastal salt marsh sediment samples.

AB  - Tidal marshes are highly valued habitats, yet are vulnerable to loss from both anthropogenic and natural disturbances including sea-level rise (SLR). Many tidal marshes have kept pace with SLR over the last century; on average, however, recent escalations in SLR increase the vulnerability of marshes to submergence. Relative sea-level rise near our study sites in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. averaged 4.34 mm year(-1) over the last 50 years, yet over the last 19 years, relative sea-level rise averaged 6.25 mm year(-1) and the rise in high tide water levels averaged 8.13 mm year(-1). We compared these rates of water rise to rates of marsh surface elevation change using surface elevation tables in ten tidal marshes-three tidal freshwater and four saline marshes in the Delaware Estuary and three salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, NJ, USA. We also examined the effects of marsh type and geomorphic setting on rates of elevation change, surface accretion, and subsurface change as well as the influence of marsh elevation, distance from a channel, and tidal range (n = 3 sites per marsh). Surface elevation change measured over the last 4 to 9 years averaged less than 6 mm year(-1) in nine out of ten of the study stations, less than rates of relative SLR. Tidal freshwater marshes in the Delaware Estuary had greater rates of surface accretion and elevation change than salt marshes in Barnegat Bay. Marshes sitting lower in the tidal frame and experiencing higher tidal ranges tended to have higher surface accretion rates, but shallow subsidence had a stronger influence on these elevation change rates. We estimated time to submergence (i.e., lifespan) for using rates of marsh elevation change, a SLR rate of 10 mm year(-1), and thresholds for conversion to open water using geospatial datasets. The calculated time to submergence for the majority of marshes was 60 to 80 years with some predicted to submerge in as few as 5 years. These data suggest that in order to keep pace with accelerating SLR, surface accretion in many of these marshes will have to increase at a rate that surpasses shallow subsidence (1-7 mm year(-1)).

AB  - Mesofauna taxa fill key trophic positions in soil food webs, even in terrestrial-marine boundary habitats characterized by frequent natural disturbances. Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats, characterized by frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial upper to the marine pioneer zone. Despite the high abundance of soil mesofauna in salt marshes and their important function by facilitating energy and carbon flows, the structure, trophic ecology and habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural salt marsh habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food web complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope analysis (N-15, C-13) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal habitat, the pioneer zone is exposed to inundations twice a day, but lower and upper salt marshes are less frequently inundated based on shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / taxa dominated by Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and density declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the importance of increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly, the reduced diversity and density was associated by a simplification of the food web in the pioneer zone as compared to the less inundated lower and upper salt marsh with a higher number of trophic levels. Strong variations in delta N-15 signatures demonstrated that mesofauna species are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators including second order predators or scavengers. The results document that major decomposer taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more diverse than previously assumed and predominantly dwell on autochthonous resources of the respective salt marsh zone. The results further suggest that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild predation lifestyle. The high trophic position of a large number of predators suggests that intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh food webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the salt marsh food web against disturbances.

AB  - Carbon gas fluxes in tidal marshes vary spatially and temporally because of vegetation cover, subsurface biogeochemical processes, and environmental forcing. The objective of this study was to examine how ecosystem carbon gas exchange changes along an estuarine salinity gradient. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) gas fluxes from three marshes representing a salinity gradient (0-32 ppt) in the Mobile Bay estuary, Alabama, USA. CH4 flux was relatively small with no significant differences across sites despite salinity differences. Interestingly, sediment porewater CH4 concentrations were significantly higher at the high salinity salt marsh and decreased with decreasing salinity. Midday net ecosystem exchange (where a positive rate indicates net carbon assimilated through photosynthesis) was greatest at the most fresh site (4.8 +/- A 0.3 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), followed by the saline (2.8 +/- A 1.0 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and brackish (1.4 +/- A 0.6 A mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) sites. However, net ecosystem exchange integrated diurnally revealed each marsh to be a net CO2 source to the atmosphere as a result of high ecosystem respiration with the freshwater marsh emitting more CO2 (-893.4 +/- A 187.9 g C m(-2) year(-1)) than the brackish (-517.8 +/- A 85.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and salt marsh (-410.2 +/- A 98.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)). This finding leads to the conclusion that either the marshes are losing carbon or that they receive a subsidy of respirable carbon, possibly via tidal deposition. The extent to which sedimentation from tidal deposition contributes carbon to these ecosystems, however, remains unknown. Without such a subsidy, marshes in the study area will not be able to keep up with sea level rise.

AB  - In a whole-ecosystem, nutrient addition experiment in the Plum Island Sound Estuary (Massachusetts), we tested the effects of nitrogen enrichment on the carbon and nitrogen contents, respiration, and strength of marsh soils. We measured soil shear strength within and across vegetation zones. We found significantly higher soil percent organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen in the long-term enriched marshes and higher soil respiration rates with longer duration of enrichment. The soil strength was similar in magnitude across depths and vegetation zones in the reference creeks, but showed signs of significant nutrient-mediated alteration in enriched creeks where shear strength at rooting depths of the low marsh-high marsh interface zone was significantly lower than at the sub-rooting depths or in the creek bank vegetation zone. To more closely examine the soil strength of the rooting (10-30 cm) and sub-rooting (40-60 cm) depths in the interface and creek bank vegetation zones, we calculated a vertical shear strength differential between these depths. We found significantly lower differentials in shear strength (rooting depth < sub-rooting depths) in the enriched creeks and in the interface zones. The discontinuities in the vertical and horizontal shear strength across the enriched marshes may contribute to observed fracturing and slumping occurring in the marsh systems. Tide gauge data also showed a pattern of rapid sea level rise for the period of the study, and changes in plant distribution patterns were indicative of increased flooding. Longer exposure times to nutrient-enriched waters and increased hydraulic energy associated with sea level rise may exacerbate creek bank sloughing. Additional research is needed, however, to better understand the interactions of nutrient enrichment and sea level rise on soil shear strength and stability of tidal salt marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes are research hotspots of the carbon cycle in coastal zones because large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide is fixed by salt marshes vegetation and stored in its biomass and soil. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in submarine groundwater (well water and pore water) in salt marshes plays an important role in advective exchange between the salt marshes and coastal waters. However, the molecular characteristics of DOC in salt marsh groundwater are poorly understood because of the complex DOC structures and hydrodynamic process. In this study, fluorescent components and refractory DOC (RDOC) in submarine groundwater from a salt marsh (Chongming Island, China) and adjacent coastal water were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fluorescent components identified by parallel factor analysis indicated that humic-like substances dominated the chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater. The chromophoric dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater had non-conservative behaviors because of additions from terrestrial humic substances. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated that bioactive substances (carbohydrates) contributed only 13.2%-14.8% of the dissolved organic matter in the submarine groundwater but carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAMs), the main components of RDOC, contributed 64.5% of the dissolved organic matter. Carbohydrates and CRAMs contributed 16.4% and 61.7% of the dissolved organic matter in the coastal water, similar to the contributions for submarine groundwater. The DOC concentration in submarine groundwater was 386 +/- 294 mu mol/L, which was significantly higher than that in coastal water (91 +/- 19 mu mol/L). The high DOC concentrations and >60% relative RDOC content suggested that submarine groundwater may be an important source of RDOC to coastal seawater. This information will be helpful for estimating the climate effects of salt marsh blue carbon.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used to describe and quantify subtidal, benthic animals such as polychaetes, amphipods, and shrimp. Here, for the first time, CT imaging is used to quantify wet mass of coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in cores collected from organic-rich (Jamaica Bay, New York) and mineral (North Inlet, South Carolina) Spartina alterniflora soils. Image analysis software was coupled with the CT images to measure abundance and diameter of the coarse roots and rhizomes in marsh soils. Previously, examination of marsh roots and rhizomes was limited to various hand-sieving methods that were often time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. CT imaging can discern the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat based on their varying particle densities. Calibration rods composed of materials with standard densities (i.e., air, water, colloidal silica, and glass) were used to operationally define the specific x-ray attenuations of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat in the marsh cores. Significant regression relationships were found between the CT-determined wet mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes and the hand-sieved dry mass of the coarse roots and rhizomes in both the organic-rich and mineral marsh soils. There was also a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat particle density among organic-rich and mineral soils. In only the mineral soils, there was a significant relationship between the soil percentage organic matter and the CT-determined peat wet mass. Using CT imaging, significant positive nitrogen fertilization effects on the wet masses of the coarse roots, rhizomes, and peat, and the abundance and diameter of rhizomes were measured in the mineral soils. In contrast, a deteriorating salt marsh island in Jamaica Bay had significantly less mass of coarse roots and rhizomes at depth (10-20 cm), and a significantly lower abundance of roots and rhizomes compared with a stable marsh. However, the diameters of the rhizomes in the deteriorating marsh were significantly greater than in the stable marsh. CT imaging is a rapid approach to quantify coarse roots, rhizomes, peat, and soil particle densities in coastal wetlands, but the method is unable at this time to quantify fine roots.

AB  - Australia's tidal marshes have suffered significant losses but their recently recognised importance in CO2 sequestration is creating opportunities for their protection and restoration. We compiled all available data on soil organic carbon (OC) storage in Australia's tidal marshes (323 cores). OC stocks in the surface 1 m averaged 165.41 (SE 6.96) Mg OC ha(-1) (range 14-963 Mg OC ha(-1)). The mean OC accumulation rate was 0.55 +/- 0.02 Mg OC ha(-1) yr(-1). Geomorphology was the most important predictor of OC stocks, with fluvial sites having twice the stock of OC as seaward sites. Australia's 1.4 million hectares of tidal marshes contain an estimated 212 million tonnes of OC in the surface 1 m, with a potential CO2-equivalent value of $USD7.19 billion. Annual sequestration is 0.75 Tg OC yr(-1), with a CO2-equivalent value of $ USD28.02 million per annum. This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of tidal marsh blue carbon in Australia, and illustrates their importance in climate change mitigation and adaptation, acting as CO2 sinks and buffering the impacts of rising sea level. We outline potential further development of carbon offset schemes to restore the sequestration capacity and other ecosystem services provided by Australia tidal marshes.

AB  - Total organic carbon (TOC) sediment stocks as a CO2 mitigation service require exclusion of allochthonous black (BC) and particulate inorganic carbon corrected for water-atmospheric equilibrium (PICeq). For the first time, we address this bias for a temperate salt marsh and a coastal tropical seagrass in BC hotspots that represent two different blue carbon ecosystems of Malaysia and Australia. Seagrass TOC stocks were similar to the salt marshes with soil depths < 1 m (59.3 +/- 11.3 and 74.9 +/- 18.9 MgC ha(- 1), CI 95 % respectively). Both ecosystems showed larger BC constraints than did their pristine counterparts. However, the seagrass meadows' mitigation services were largely constrained by both higher BC/TOC and PICeq/TOC fractions (38.0 % +/- 6.6 and 43.4 % +/- 5.9 %, CI 95 %) and salt marshes around a third (22 % +/- 10.2 and 6.0 % +/- 3.1 % CI 95 %). The results provide useful data from underrepresented regions, and, reiterates the need to consider both BC and PIC for more reliable blue carbon mitigation assessments to ensure that greenhouse gas emitters do not exceed the ecosystems' capacity.

AB  - This paper aims at providing insight about bromine (Br) cycle in four Portuguese estuaries: Minho, Lima (in the NW coast) and Sado, Mira (in the SW coast). The focus is on their tidal marsh environments, quite distinct with regard to key biophysicochemical attributes. Regardless of the primary bromide (Br-) common natural source, i.e., seawater, the NW marshes present relatively higher surface soil/sediment Br concentrations than the ones from SW coast. This happens in close connection with organic matter (OM) content, and is controlled by their main climatic contexts. Yet, the anthropogenic impact on Br concentrations cannot be discarded. Regarding [Br] spatial patterns across the marshes, the results show a general increase from tidal flat toward high marsh. Maxima [Br] occur in the upper driftline zone, at transition from highest low marsh to high marsh, recognized as a privileged setting for OM accumulation. Based on the discovery of OM ubiquitous bromination in marine and transitional environments, it is assumed that this Br occurs mainly as organobromine. Analysis of two dated sediment cores indicates that, despite having the same age (AD similar to 1300), the Caminha salt marsh (Minho estuary) evidences higher Br enrichment than the Casa Branca salt marsh (Mira estuary). This is related to a greater Br storage ability, which is linked to OM build-up and rate dynamics under different climate scenarios. Both cores evidence a fairly similar temporal Br enrichment pattern, and may be interpreted in light of the sun-climate coupling. Thereby, most of the well-known Grand Solar Minima during the Little Ice Age appear to have left an imprint on these marshes, supported by higher [Br] in soils/sediments. Besides climate changes driven by solar activity and impacting marsh Br biogeodynamics, those Br enrichment peaks might also reflect inputs of enhanced volcanic activity covarying with Grand Solar Minima.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are biologically productive ecosystems that generate and sequester significant quantities of organic matter. Plant biomass varies spatially within a salt marsh and it is tedious and often logistically impractical to quantify biomass from field measurements across an entire landscape. Satellite data are useful for estimating aboveground biomass, however, high-resolution data are needed to resolve the spatial details within a salt marsh. This study used 3-m resolution multispectral data provided by Planet to estimate aboveground biomass within two salt marshes, North Inlet-Winyah Bay (North Inlet) National Estuary Research Reserve, and Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) Long-Term Ecological Research site. The Akaike information criterion analysis was performed to test the fidelity of several alternative models. A combination of the modified soil vegetation index 2 (MSAVI(2)) and the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) gave the best fit to the square root-normalized biomass data collected in the field at North Inlet (Willmott's index of agreement d = 0.74, RMSE = 223.38 g/m(2), AIC(w) = 0.3848). An acceptable model was not found among all models tested for PIE data, possibly because the sample size at PIE was too small, samples were collected over a limited vertical range, in a different season, and from areas with variable canopy architecture. For North Inlet, a model-derived landscape scale biomass map showed differences in biomass density among sites, years, and showed a robust relationship between elevation and biomass. The growth curve established in this study is particularly useful as an input for biogeomorphic models of marsh development. This study showed that, used in an appropriate model with calibration, Planet data are suitable for computing and mapping aboveground biomass at high resolution on a landscape scale, which is needed to better understand spatial and temporal trends in salt marsh primary production.

AB  - Sea-level rise associated with climate change presents a major challenge to plant diversity and ecosystem service provision in coastal wetlands. In this study, we investigate the effect of sea-level rise on benthos, vegetation, and ecosystem diversity in a tidal wetland in west Wales, the UK. Present relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were investigated through 50 plots at which vegetation (species and coverage), hydrological (surface or groundwater depth, conductivity) and soil (matrix chroma, presence or absence of mottles, organic content, particle size) data were collected. Benthic communities were sampled at intervals along a continuum from saline to freshwater. To ascertain future changes to the wetlands' hydrology, a GIS-based empirical model was developed. Using a LiDAR derived land surface, the relative effect of peat accumulation and rising sea levels were modelled over 200 years to determine how frequently portions of the wetland will be inundated by mean sea level, mean high water spring and mean high water neap conditions. The model takes into account changing extents of peat accumulation as hydrological conditions alter.
   Model results show that changes to the wetland hydrology will initially be slow. However, changes in frequency and extent of inundation reach a tipping point 125 to 175 years from 2010 due to the extremely low slope of the wetland. From then onwards, large portions of the wetland become flooded at every flood tide and saltwater intrusion becomes more common. This will result in a reduction in marsh biodiversity with plant communities switching toward less diverse and occasionally monospecific communities that are more salt tolerant.
   While the loss of tidal freshwater wetland is in line with global predictions, simulations suggest that in the Teifi marshes the loss will be slow at first, but then rapid. While there will be a decrease in biodiversity, the model indicated that at least for one ecosystem service, carbon storage, there is potential for an increase in the near future.

AB  - The Defense Coastal/Estuarine Research Program (DCERP) was a 10-year multi-investigator project funded by the Department of Defense to improve understanding of ecosystem processes and their interactions with natural and anthropogenic stressors at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (MCBCL) located in coastal North Carolina. The project was aimed at facilitating ecosystem-based management (EBM) at the MCBCL and other coastal military installations. Because of its scope, interdisciplinary character, and duration, DCERP embodied many of the opportunities and challenges associated with EBM, including the need for explicit goals, system models, longterm perspectives, systems complexity, change inevitability, consideration of humans as ecosystem components, and program adaptability and accountability. We describe key elements of this program, its contributions to coastal EBM, and its relevance as an exemplar of EBM.

AB  - Saline coastal marshes are blue carbon ecosystems with relatively high soil carbon (C) stocks and high rates of soil C accumulation. Loss of saline wetlands due to relative sea-level rise, land-use change, and hydrologic alterations liberates previously stored C and reduces the capacity for future C sequestration. Widespread wetland loss has prompted marsh restoration and creation projects around the world; however, little is known about the timescale and capacity for created marshes to function as blue C sinks and the role of environmental conditions in mediating soil C accumulation in restoration sites. Using a chronosequence of five created saline marshes ranging in age from 5 to 32 yr and two adjacent natural reference marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA, short- and longer-term C accumulation rates (SCAR and LCAR, respectively) were determined using feldspar marker horizons and peat depth in cores at six locations in each marsh. Created marshes ranged in elevation from -12 to 41 cm (NAVD88) and supported assorted plant community compositions driven by local environmental conditions. SCAR ranged from 75 to 430 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), which were comparable in the two youngest and two oldest marshes. Longer-term CAR ranged from 18 to 99 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) but did not significantly differ among marshes of different ages. Our findings indicate that LCAR in these created marshes were influenced by site-specific environmental conditions (i.e., stem density and mineral sediment) rather than marsh age. Results suggest that conditions appropriate for the establishment of vegetation with high stem densities, such as Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, may facilitate higher LCAR in created marshes, which may be useful for restoration project planning and mitigation of climate change.

AB  - We studied the population ecology of the snail Melampus bidentatus in relation to patch composition and landscape structure across several salt marsh systems in Connecticut, USA. These marshes have changed significantly over the past 40-50 years including loss of total area, increased areas of short Spartina alterniflora, and decreased areas and fragmentation of Spartina patens. These changes are consistent with tidal inundation patterns that indicate frequent flooding of high marsh areas. Melampus bidentatus densities were highly variable, both among different salt marsh systems and locations within specific marshes, but were generally similar among short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens patches within locations. Densities were lowest where the marsh was regularly inundated at high tide and only remnant Sp.patens patches remained. Almost no snails were found in bare patches. Areas that had large Sp.patens patches adjacent to short Sp.alterniflora supported the highest M.bidentatus densities. Population size-structure varied significantly among patch types, with higher proportions of large individuals in short Sp.alterniflora and hummocked Sp.patens patches than in large and remnant Sp.patens patches. This was likely due to size-selective predation and/or higher snail growth rates due to better food resource conditions in short Sp.alterniflora patches. Egg mass densities and the number of eggs per egg mass were highest in short Sp.alterniflora. Our results indicate that M.bidentatus is resilient to the level and patterns of salt marsh change evident at our study sites. Indeed, snail densities were significantly higher than reported in other field studies, suggesting that increased patch areas of short Sp.alterniflora and associated environmental conditions at our study sites may provide more favorable habitats than previously when marshes were dominated by extensive Sp.patens meadows. However, there may be threshold conditions that could overwhelm the ability of M.bidentatus to maintain itself within salt marsh systems where changes in hydrology, sedimentation and other factors lead to increased numbers of bare patches and ponds and loss of short Sp.alterniflora and Sp.patens. Studies of the responses of resident and transient fauna to salt marsh change are critically needed in order to better understand the implications for salt marsh ecosystem dynamics and services.

AB  - The primary productivity of coastal wetlands is changing dramatically in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, nitrogen (N) enrichment, and invasions by novel species, potentially altering their ecosystem services and resilience to sea level rise. In order to determine how these interacting global change factors will affect coastal wetland productivity, we quantified growing-season carbon assimilation (approximate to gross primary productivity, or GPP) and carbon retained in living plant biomass (approximate to net primary productivity, or NPP) of North American mid-Atlantic saltmarshes invaded by Phragmites australis (common reed) under four treatment conditions: two levels of CO2 (ambient and + 300 ppm) crossed with two levels of N(0 and 25 gN added m(-2) yr(-1)). For GPP, we combined descriptions of canopy structure and leaf-level photosynthesis in a simulation model, using empirical data from an open-top chamber field study. Under ambient CO2 and low N loading (i.e., the Control), we determined GPP to be 1.66 +/- 0.05 kg Cm-2 yr(-1) at a typical Phragmites stand density. Individually, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 44 and 60%, respectively. Changes under N enrichment came largely from stimulation to carbon assimilation early and late in the growing season, while changes from CO2 came from stimulation during the early and mid-growing season. In combination, elevated CO2 and N enrichment increased GPP by 95% over the Control, yielding 3.24 +/- 0.08 kg Cm-2 yr(-1). We used biomass data to calculate NPP, and determined that it represented 44%-60% of GPP, with global change conditions decreasing carbon retention compared to the Control. Our results indicate that Phragmites invasions in eutrophied saltmarshes are driven, in part, by extended phenology yielding 3.1 x greater NPP than native marsh. Further, we can expect elevated CO2 to amplify Phragmites productivity throughout the growing season, with potential implications including accelerated spread and greater carbon storage belowground.

AB  - The present study provides estimates of the vegetation structure and its plant communities in the coastal salt marshes between Damietta and Port Said, to determine the factor or factors controlling the species distribution and to correlate the vegetational gradients with the edaphic factors.  Five major communities constitute the major part of the natural vegetation of the study area and are dominated by five perennials:
   Zygophyllum acgyptium A. Hosny, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moric.) Moris and Delmonte, Halocnemum strobilaceum (Pallas) M. Bieb., Juncus acutus L. and Juncus rigidus Desf.  Therophytes are the most frequent life-form in these communities.  The results of this study confirm the presence of a Mediterranean floristic territory in Egypt.  Analysis of the correlation between the vegetational gradients and the edaphic factors shows that calcium carbonate, organic carbon, sulfate, bicarbonate and potassium are the main operating edaphic factors in this habitat.

AB  - We outline a plausible, albeit extreme, managed realignment scenario ('Extended Deep Green' scenario) for a large UK estuary to demonstrate the maximum possible biogeochemical effects and economic outcomes of estuarine management decisions. Our interdisciplinary approach aims to better inform the policy process, by combining biogeochemical and socioeconomic components of managed realignment schemes. Adding 7494 ha of new intertidal area to the UK Humber estuary through managed realignment leads to the annual accumulation of a 1.2 x 10(5) t of 'new' sediment and increases the current annual sink of organic C and N, and particle reactive P in the estuary by 150%, 83% and 50%, respectively. The increase in intertidal area should also increase denitrification. However, this positive outcome is offset by the negative effect of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions in new marshes in the low salinity region of the estuary. Short-term microbial reactions decrease the potential benefits Of CO2 sequestration through gross organic carbon burial by at least 50%. Net carbon storage is thus most effective where oxidation and denitrification reactions are reduced. In the Humber this translates to wet, saline marshes at the seaward end of estuaries. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to determine the economic efficiency of the Extended Deep Green managed realignment. When compared to a 'Hold-the-Line' future scenario, i.e. the present state/extent of sea defences in the estuary, the CBA shows that managed realignment is cost effective when viewed on > 25 year timescales. This is because capital costs are incurred in the first years, whereas the benefits from habitat creation, carbon sequestration and reduced maintenance costs build up over time. Over 50- and 100-year timescales, the Extended Deep Green managed realignment scenario is superior in efficiency terms. The increased sediment accumulation is also likely to enhance storage of contaminant metals. In the case of Cu, a metal that currently causes significant water quality issues, Cu removal due to burial of suspended sediment in realigned areas translates to a value of approximately 1000 pound a(-1) (avoided clean up costs). Although this is not formally included in the,CBA it illustrates another likely positive economic outcome of managed realignment. Although we focus on the Humber, the history of reclamation and its biogeochemistry is common to many estuaries in northern Europe. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal habitats including saltmarshes and mangrove forests can accumulate and store significant blue carbon stocks, which may persist for millennia. Despite this implied stability, the distribution and structure of intertidal-supratidal wetlands are known to respond to changes imposed by geomorphic evolution, climatic, sea level, and anthropogenic influences. In this study, we reconstruct environmental histories and biogeochemical conditions in four wetlands of similar contemporary vegetation in SE Australia. The objective is to assess the importance of historic factors to contemporary organic carbon (C) stocks and accumulation rates. Results from the four corestwo collected from marine-influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo marine site (WAP-M) and Port Stephens marine site (POR-M)) and two from fluvial influenced saltmarshes (Wapengo fluvial site (WAP-F) and Port Stephens fluvial site (POR-F))highlight different environmental histories and preservation conditions. High C stocks are associated with the presence of a mangrove phase below the contemporary saltmarsh sediments in the POR-M and POR-F cores. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses show this historic mangrove root C to be remarkably stable in its molecular composition despite its age, consistent with its position in deep sediments. WAP-M and WAP-F cores did not contain mangrove root C; however, significant preservation of char C (up to 46% of C in some depths) in WAP-F reveals the importance of historic catchment processes to this site. Together, these results highlight the importance of integrating historic ecosystem and catchment factors into attempts to upscale C accounting to broader spatial scales.

AB  - Soil evolution in salt marshes at North Inlet, SC, is driven by slowly rising sea level (3.4 mm/yr). As sea level rises the boundary between the low-lying coastal forest and high marsh moves up slope. As sandy forested Spodosols become subject to tidal inundation and salinization, forest vegetation (Pinus, Quercus, Nyssa, Lagerstroemia, and Vaccinium) is replaced successively by Cedrus, Iva, Juncus, Borrichia, Salicornia, short-form Spartina, and finally medium Spartina. These botanical changes accompany gradual changes in soil texture, chemistry and morphology. The originally sandy textured A and E horizons of the Spodosol become progressively enriched in clay and silt by tidal deposition of marine mud. These fine grained deposits do not form a distinct geogenetic layer but rather are mixed downward into the original sandy horizons by intense fiddler crab (Uca) burrowing. Thus soils in the marsh become gradually more sandy with depth. The strong color contrast between the original A and E horizons is eventually obliterated by mud enrichment and the growth of a dense Spartina root mat, leaving a medium gray A horizon that is difficult to sub-divide. In addition, the decay of organic matter in the marsh soils via sulfate reduction results in increased soil sulfur with distance into the marsh.
   The sandy, black spodic horizon originally formed in the forest environment occurs beneath the marsh surface at depths of less than 1 m and to distances of several hundred meters from the forest-marsh boundary. Except perhaps for its upper 10 cm, the spodic B horizon appears to have been little affected by marsh processes. The presence of the spodic horizon in the marsh profile, and the fact that it is not buried beneath a sufficiently thick and distinct geologic deposit, poses an interesting taxonomic problem. Based on their moisture regime, sulfur content, and spodic horizons, the marsh soils are best classified as Sulfaquentic Haplaquods. However, the spodic horizon, which is diagnostic for this classification, is clearly relict in terms of the processes that are thought to be responsible for its formation.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure from land-derived eutrophication in most developed coastlines worldwide. Here, we tested for 277 days the effects of a nutrient pulse on blue carbon retention and cycling within an Australian temperate coastal system. After 56 days of exposure, saltmarsh and mangrove plots subject to a high-nutrient treatment (-20 g N m? 2 yr? 1 and -2 g P m? 2 yr? 1) had -23% lower superficial soil carbon stocks. Mangrove plots also experienced a -33% reduction in the microbe Amplicon Sequence Variant richness and a shift in community structure linked to elevated ammonium concentrations. Live plant cover, tea litter decomposition, and soil carbon fluxes (CO2 and CH4) were not significantly affected by the pulse. Before the end of the experiment, soil carbon- and nitrogen-cycling had returned to control levels, highlighting the significant but short-lived impact that a nutrient pulse can have on the carbon sink capacity of coastal wetlands.

AB  - Estuaries are often considered sinks for contaminants and the cleanup of salt marshes, sensitive ecosystems with a major ecological role, should be carried out by means of least intrusive approaches, such as bioremediation. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of plant-microorganisms associations on petroleum hydrocarbons fate in salt marshes of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal). Sediments un-colonized and colonized (rhizosediments) by different plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata and Spartina patens) were sampled in four sites of the lower and middle estuary for hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (HD), total cell counts (TCC) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) assessment. In general, TPHs, HD and TCC were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in rhizosediments than in un-colonized sediments. Also recorded were differences on the abundance of hydrocarbon degraders among the rhizosediment of the different plants collected at the same site (J. maritimus < P. australis < T. striata), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between J. maritimus and T. striata. Moreover, strong positive correlations-0.81 and 0.84 (P < 0.05), between biotic (HD) and abiotic (organic matter content) parameters and TPHs concentrations were also found. Our data clearly suggest that salt marsh plants can influence the microbial community, by fostering the development of hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations in its rhizosphere, an effect observed for all plants. This effect, combined with the plant capability to retain hydrocarbons around the roots, points out that salt marsh plant-microorganisms associations may actively contribute to hydrocarbon removal and degradation in estuarine environments.

AB  - Benthic microalgae are a ubiquitous feature in sediments directly exposed to full sunlight or shaded by a vascular plant canopy in coastal salt marshes. Diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae are the dominant groups. Of these, diatoms are universally present and abundant, exhibit migratory rhythms driven mainly by light, and are by far the taxonomically most diverse group. Dense mats of cyanobacteria and secondarily green algae frequently develop where light levels are high. The more abundant species of all three algal groups are widely distributed within and among salt marshes of the United States and Europe. Standing crops of benthic microalgae beneath various vascular plant canopies exhibit mean annual values of 60 to 160 mg chi a m(-2). Annual benthic microalgal production (BMP) has been shown to range from 28 g C m(-2) y(-1) beneath (-2) 1 beneath Jaumea carnosa. In general, BMP Juncus roemerianus to 314 g C m(-2) y(-1) increases in a southerly direction in Atlantic coast marshes but is lowest in Gulf Coast marshes. In Atlantic and southern California marshes a significant portion of benthic microalgal production occurs when the overstory vascular plants are dormant. Experimental manipulations have shown that BMP and biomass beneath Spartina alterniflora are limited by nitrogen supplies and grazing activities. Manipulation of light appears to primarily affect the relative dominance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the benthic microalgal assemblage. The ratio of annual BMP to net aerial production of the overstory vascular plant canopy is 10 to 60% in Atlantic and Gulf Coast marshes and 75 to 140% in a southern California marsh. The benthic microalgal portion of this two component productivity system has been shown by multiple stable isotope studies to be a major component of salt marsh food webs. Diatoms, in particular, are the preferred food item of a diverse array of invertebrate and fish species.

AB  - Plant-derived aromatic compounds are important components of the dissolved organic carbon pool in coastal salt marshes, and their mineralization by resident bacteria contributes to carbon cycling in these systems. Members of the roseobacter lineage of marine bacteria are abundant in coastal salt marshes, and several characterized strains, including Sagittula stellata E-37, utilize aromatic compounds as primary growth substrates. The genome sequence of S. stellata contains multiple, potentially competing, aerobic ring-cleaving pathways. Preferential hierarchies in substrate utilization and complex transcriptional regulation have been demonstrated to be the norm in many soil bacteria that also contain multiple ring-cleaving pathways. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether substrate preference exists in S. stellata when the organism is provided a mixture of aromatic compounds that proceed through different ring-cleaving pathways. We focused on the protocatechuate (pca) and the aerobic benzoyl coenzyme A (box) pathways and the substrates known to proceed through them, p-hydroxybenzoate (POB) and benzoate, respectively. When these two substrates were provided at nonlimiting carbon concentrations, temporal patterns of cell density, gene transcript abundance, enzyme activity, and substrate concentrations indicated that S. stellata simultaneously catabolized both substrates. Furthermore, enhanced growth rates were observed when S. stellata was provided both compounds simultaneously compared to the rates of cells grown singly with an equimolar concentration of either substrate alone. This simultaneous-catabolism phenotype was also demonstrated in another lineage member, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3. These findings challenge the paradigm of sequential aromatic catabolism reported for soil bacteria and contribute to the growing body of physiological evidence demonstrating the metabolic versatility of roseobacters.

AB  - Salt marshes provide important services to coastal ecosystems in the southeastern United States. In many locations, salt marsh habitats are threatened by coastal development and erosion, necessitating large-scale monitoring. Assessing vegetation height across the extent of a marsh can provide a comprehensive analysis of its health, as vegetation height is associated with Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and can be used to track degradation or growth over time. Traditional methods to do this, however, rely on manual measurements of stem heights that can cause harm to the marsh ecosystem. Moreover, manual measurements are limited in scale and are often time and labor intensive. Unoccupied Aircraft Systems (UAS) can provide an alternative to manual measurements and generate continuous results across a large spatial extent in a short period of time. In this study, a multirotor UAS equipped with optical Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral sensors was used to survey five salt marshes in Beaufort, North Carolina. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry of the resultant imagery allowed for continuous modeling of the entire marsh ecosystem in a three-dimensional space. From these models, vegetation height was extracted and compared to ground-based manual measurements. Vegetation heights generated from UAS data consistently under-predicted true vegetation height proportionally and a transformation was developed to predict true vegetation height. Vegetation height may be used as a proxy for Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and contribute to blue carbon estimates, which describe the carbon sequestered in marine ecosystems. Employing this transformation, our results indicate that UAS and SfM are capable of producing accurate assessments of salt marsh health via consistent and accurate vegetation height measurements.

AB  - CH4 emissions could vary with biotic and abiotic factors at different time scales. However, little is known about temporal dynamics of CH4 flux and its controls in coastal marshes. In this study, CH4 flux was continuously measured with the eddy covariance technique for 2 years in a subtropical salt marsh in eastern China. Wavelet analysis was applied to explore the multi-scale variations of CH4 flux and its controls. Additionally, partial wavelet coherence was used to disentangle confounding effects of measured variables. No consistent diurnal pattern was found in CH4 fluxes. However, the hot-moments of CH4 flux were observed after nighttime high tide on days near the spring tide. Periodic dynamics were also observed at multi-day, semilunar and seasonal scales. Tide height in summer had a negative effect on CH4 flux at the semilunar scale. Air temperature explained most variations in CH4 fluxes at the multi-day scale but CH4 flux was mainly controlled by PAR and GEP at the seasonal scale. Air temperature explained 48% and 56% of annual variations in CH4 fluxes in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In total, the salt marsh acted as a CH4 source (17.6 +/- 3.0 g C-CH4 m(-2) year(-1)), which was higher than most studies report for inland wetlands. Our results show that CH4 fluxes exhibit multiple periodicities and its controls vary with time scale; moreover, CH4 flux is strongly modified by tide. This study emphasizes the importance of ecosystem-specific measurements of CH4 fluxes, and more work is needed to estimate regional CH4 budgets.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in mitigating global warming. To evaluate the impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on global warming potential (GWP) in Chinese coastal areas, we measured CH4 and N2O fluxes and soil organic carbon sequestration rates along a transect of coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province, China, including open water; bare tidal flat; and invasive S. alterniflora, native Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis marshes. Annual CH4 emissions were estimated as 2.81, 4.16, 4.88, 10.79, and 16.98kg CH(4)ha(-1) for open water, bare tidal flat, and P. australis, S. salsa, and S. alterniflora marshes, respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasion increased CH4 emissions by 57-505%. In contrast, negative N2O fluxes were found to be significantly and negatively correlated (P<0.001) with net ecosystem CO2 exchange during the growing season in S. alterniflora and P. australis marshes. Annual N2O emissions were 0.24, 0.38, and 0.56kg N(2)Oha(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat and S. salsa marsh, respectively, compared with -0.51kg N(2)Oha(-1) for S. alterniflora marsh and -0.25kg N(2)Oha(-1) for P. australis marsh. The carbon sequestration rate of S. alterniflora marsh amounted to 3.16 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1) in the top 100cm soil profile, a value that was 2.63- to 8.78-fold higher than in native plant marshes. The estimated GWP was 1.78, -0.60, -4.09, and -1.14Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1)yr(-1) in open water, bare tidal flat, P. australis marsh and S. salsa marsh, respectively, but dropped to -11.30Mg CO(2)eqha(-1)yr(-1) in S. alterniflora marsh. Our results indicate that although S. alterniflora invasion stimulates CH4 emissions, it can efficiently mitigate increases in atmospheric CO2 and N2O along the coast of China.

AB  - Salt marsh sediment volume decreases from organic decomposition, compaction of solids, and de-watering, and each of these processes may change with age. Variability in the vertical accretion rate within the upper 2 m was determined by assembling results from concurrent application of the Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating techniques used to estimate sediment age since 1963/1964, and 0 to ca 100+ years before present (yBP), respectively. The relationship between Pb-210 and the Cs-137 dated accretion rates (Sed(210) and Sed(137), respectively) was linear for 45 salt marsh and mangrove environments. Sed(210) averaged 75% of Sed137 suggesting that vertical accretion over the last 100+ years is driven by soil organic matter accumulation, as shown for the pre Cs-137 dated horizon. The ratio of Sed(210)/Sed(137) declines with increasing mineral content. A linear multiple regression equation that includes bulk density and Sed(137) to predict Sed(210) described 97% of the variance in Sed(210). Sediments from Connecticut, Delaware and Louisiana coastal environments dated with C-14 indicate a relatively constant sediment accretion rate of 0.13 cm year(-1) for 1000-7000 yBP, which occurs within 2 m of today's marsh surface and equals modern sea level rise rates. Soil subsidence is not shown to be distinctly different in these vastly different coastal settings. The major reason why the Sed(137) measurements indicate higher accretion rates than do the Sed(210) measurements is because the former apply to younger sediments where the effects of root growth and decomposition are greater than in the latter. The most intense rates of change in soil volume in organic-rich salt marshes sediments is, therefore, neither in deep or old sediments (> 4 m; > 1000 years), but within the first several hundreds of years after accumulation. The average changes in organic and inorganic constituents downcore are nearly equal for 58 dated sediment cores from the northern Gulf of Mexico. These parallel changes downcore are best described as resulting from compaction, rather than from organic matter decomposition. Thus most of the volumetric changes in these salt marsh sediments occurs in the upper 2 m, and declines quickly with depth. Extrapolation forwards or backwards, using results from the Pb-210 and the Cs-137 dating technique appear to be warranted for the types of samples from the environments described here.

AB  - This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability in the volumetric sediment balance of Allen Creek marsh, a macro-tidal salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy. The volumetric balance was determined as the balance of inputs of sediments and organic matter via accretion on the marsh surface and Outputs of sedimentary material primarily due to erosion of the marsh margin. Changes in marsh surface elevation were measured at 20 buried plates and 3 modified sediment elevation tables from 1996 - 2002, and detailed margin surveys were conducted in 1997, 1999 and 2001 using a differential global positioning system. Changes in surface area were calculated using GIS overlay analysis and used in Conjunction with accretion and erosion data to derive volumetric estimates of gains and losses of sedimentary material in the marsh system.
   Currently the volumetric sediment balance at Allen Creek marsh is positive. However the processes of erosion and accretion demonstrate seasonal, annual and spatial variability. Inputs to the system include deposition oil the marsh surface from sediment laden waters and from ice rafting of sediments. Sediment is deposited onto the marsh surface year round, even during the winter when vegetation cover is sparse, and the amount of deposition in general is not significantly correlated with the frequency of tidal inundations. Based oil the data from 1996 to 2002, the mid and high marsh zones experience mean accretion rates of approximately 1.4 cm year(-1) whereas accretion rates in the low marsh region are statistically significantly lower (0.8 cm year(-1)). The absolute amount of accretion varies between seasons and from year to year. The main loss to the marsh is through erosion of the marsh margin cliffs which can remove a comparatively large Volume of sedimentary material in one mass wasting event and which also decreases the vegetated surface area available for deposition from sediment laden waters. The volume of material removed from the marsh margin almost tripled between 1997 (169 m(3)) and 2001 (502 m(3)) following breaching of the side of a tidal creek channel, altering the patterns of margin erosion and deposition in the marsh system. During this time, however, other sheltered areas of the marsh system, such as along the tidal creek banks, showed evidence of new vegetation growth, increasing the amount of vegetated surface area available for deposition.
   The processes of erosion and deposition on the marsh surface exhibit considerable spatial variability, with different regions of the marsh being more or less sensitive to seasonal variability in the dominant controls influencing sediment deposition and erosion in this system, namely wave activity, vegetation, ice and water depths. A key factor in predicting how a marsh will evolve and respond to a number of different controls, e.g. sea-level rise or reduced sediment supply, is to quantify both accretion of the marsh surface and erosion of the marsh margin, evaluating the marsh system as a volumetric whole. This study demonstrates that a marsh system should be assessed in three dimensions rather than simply as a surface of accumulation. This is particularly important for open coastal marshes exposed to the erosive action of waves. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rigths reserved.

AB  - We measured sediment organic carbon and nitrogen accumulation and rates of denitrification enzyme activity and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) production from slurries of sediments of a mudflat that formed in 2002, a young (8-year-old) natural Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that developed on part of the mudfiat, and four mature (>200 years old) salt marshes in southeastern Georgia to examine microbial processes related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling during succession from mudflat to mature marsh. Soil organic C and N and C: N ratio (0-30 cm) increased across the chronosequence from mudflat (791 +/- 35 g C/m(2), 125 +/- 17 g N/m(2)) to young marsh (2520 +/- 131 g C/m(2), 190 +/- 10 g N/m(2)) to mature marshes (5827 +/- 250 g C/m(2), 372 +/- 20 g N/m(2)). After 8 years of colonization by S. alterniflora, sediment organic carbon increased 3.2 times, and nitrogen increased 1.5 times relative to the mudflat The high rate of organic C and N accumulation based on time series measurements (188 g C/m(2)/yr, 7.8 g N/m(2)/yr) and feldspar marker layers (359 g C/m(2)/yr, 26.2 g N/m(2)/yr) was attributed to high accretion (3 cm/yr) in this low elevation (0.18 m NAVD88) emerging marsh. Carbon dioxide production increased with increasing sediment organic C from mudfiat to mature marshes. Un-amended denitrification enzyme activity, measured in slurry incubations, ranged from an average of 0.020 +/- 0.005 mu g g(-1) hr(-1) in the mature marshes to 0.094 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1), hr(-1) in the young marsh. We also measured denitrification potential in slurry incubations amended with C (glucose), N (nitrate), and C + N to assess the potential for substrate limitations. Denitrification potential in the mudflat did not show strong nutrient limitation. In the young marsh, denitrification potential was C-limited, and in the mature marsh, it was co-limited by C and N. In July samples, CO2 production showed a statistically significant increase with age from the mudfiat to the mature marshes. However, in both months, CO2 production efficiency (expressed on a per g C basis) was significantly higher in the mudfiat sediment slurries than in the young marsh and mature marsh samples. Spartina colonization of mudflats and the subsequent accumulation of organic matter are key to enriching sediment organic C and N pools that control microbial heterotrophy, particularly denitrification and CO2 production, which play important roles in marsh C and N cycling.

   Two species of cordgrass (Spartina anglica Hubbard and Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) were artificially introduced to the intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province, China, in 1963 and 1982, respectively. However, as alien species, the impact of Spartina on the tidal flat ecosystem remains largely unknown. Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, two native plants in the intertidal zone of northern Jiangsu Province, China, are C3-type plants, whereas the Spartina species are C4-type plants. In this article, we investigate the vertical distribution of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic carbon isotope ratios in different ecosystems associated with the northern Jiangsu tidal flats; analyze changes in the organic carbon sources in the tidal flat sediments after Spartina colonization; compare carbon burial patterns at different evolutionary stages in the tidal flats; and discuss the effects of Spartina on organic carbon cycling over the intertidal flats on the Jiangsu, China, coast. Before the introduction of Spartina, the organic material in the intertidal sediments of the study area mainly came from a combination of marine and C3 plants. After the introduction of Spartina, the contribution of S. alternillora to the organic carbon content in the salt-marsh strata exceeded those made by marine sources and other C3 plants. On the S. anglica flat, the quantity of organic carbon originated from S. anglica was lower than from S. alternillora but was still greater than the contribution made by native C3 plants. The introduction of Spartina not only had a significant effect on primary productivity throughout the tidal flats but also enhanced the organic carbon accumulation rate in the sediment.

AB  - Ocean acidification will have many negative consequences for marine organisms and ecosystems, leading to a decline in many ecosystem services provided by the marine environment. This study reviews the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on seagrasses, assessing how this may affect their capacity to sequester carbon in the future and providing an economic valuation of these changes. If ocean acidification leads to a significant increase in above- and below-ground biomass, the capacity of seagrass to sequester carbon will be significantly increased. The associated value of this increase in sequestration capacity is approximately 500 and 600 billion globally between 2010 and 2100. A proportionally similar increase in carbon sequestration value was found for the UK. This study highlights one of the few positive stories for ocean acidification and underlines that sustainable management of seagrasses is critical to avoid their continued degradation and loss of carbon sequestration capacity.

AB  - To better understand the origin, composition, and reactivity of sedimentary humic substances (HSs) in salt marshes in the Changjiang Estuary, HS samples were isolated from a sediment core that was collected from the Eastern Chongming salt marsh. Chemical and spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the features of these HSs. The results indicate that the studied HSs in the salt marsh sediments are mainly terrestrial-derived and that the sedimentary organic matter (SUM) in the top layer may contain more organic matter from marine sources and/or autochthonous materials due to the dramatic decreasing of the sediment supply as a result of damming. The degradation of labile carbohydrates and proteins and the preservation of refractory lignin components dominate the early diagenetic reactions of SUM in the salt marsh area. The average contents of the carboxylic groups in FAs and HAs are 11.64 +/- 1.08 and 7.13 +/- 0.16 meq/gC, and those of phenolic groups are 1.95 +/- 0.13 and 2.40 +/- 0.44 meq/gC, respectively. The content of carboxylic groups increased with increasing depth, while there were no obvious changes in the content of phenolic groups. The average concentration of total proton-binding sites is approximately 12.5 mu mol/g sediment for the studied HSs. These values may provide insight into the migration and fate of HS-bound contaminants in sediments and the overlying sea water in the salt marsh areas of the Changjiang Estuary.

AB  - The advancement of species poleward, due to global warming. has recently been documented worldwide. In Louisiana, Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) is moving northward into Spartina alterniflora salt marshes. Mangroves were historically restricted to southernmost islands and beaches by winter freezes; however. recently a noticeable expansion has occurred. The influence that mangroves have oil ecosystem processes within Louisiana salt marshes has not been documented. Thus. this research examined the effects of mangrove expansion oil sediment accretion, organic matter production and decomposition, and carbon assimilation, as well as edaphic parameters. Our results indicate that presently mangrove expansion has had no major effects on the ecosystem processes Measured. Sediment accretion, belowground production, decomposition. and carbon assimilation were similar between Avicennia and Spartina. Where mangroves expanded into the surrounding salt marsh, elevation. redox potential, bulk density, and soil ammonium Were slightly higher, while soil moisture and porewater salinity were somewhat lower. Because the mangroves are small ill stature and areal extent, significant effects oil ecosystem processes may presently be somewhat muted. However. if stands continue to grow. noted effects may occur ill the future. Our research provides a baseline from which future ecosystem responses may be evaluated as mangroves in Louisiana continue to develop.

AB  - We investigated carbon (C) fluxes from Spartina alterniflora community comparing with native C-3-plant (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) communities as well as mudflat in a coastal marsh in eastern China by determining the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and soil respiration (R-SOIL) monthly with static chambers over one year. Plant biological traits and soil organic carbon (SOC) were measured at the end of the growing season. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as the sum of R-ECO and NEE, while the respiration of aboveground plant (R-AG) was assessed by the difference between R-ECO and R-SOIL. The invasion of S. alterniflora significantly increased R-ECO, GPP, and R-AG in salt marsh. The NEE in the S. alterniflora community was significantly lower than in mudflat and S. salsa community (p < 0.05), but was comparable to that in P. australis community (p > 0.05). R-SOIL among sites with different communities did not show significant variations (p > 0.05). Surface water inhibited R-SOIL and made it insensitive to changes in environmental factors across communities. Relative to other communities, the lower shoot-root ratio of S. alterniflora community together with its higher R-ECO and R-AG determined a higher proportion of C allocated in belowground, which ultimately resulted in increment of SOC as well as increased GPP. The invasion of S. alterniflora potentially induces a negative feedback to the global climate change by regulating the C sequestration in salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes sequester a large amount of carbon via sedimentation, but seasonal and climate change impacts on sediment carbon biogeochemistry are not well-understood. This study investigates the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from New England salt marsh sediment seasonally and under possible expected drought conditions. Surface sediment total organic carbon (TOC) values shifted seasonally depending on the overlying dominant plant species suggesting that vegetation and inundation frequency and duration are key factors in sediment TOC fluctuations. Fall sediment samples leached more DOC than summer samples, were compositionally similar to the estuarine water column, and compositionally different from fresh plant matter. Thus, the seasonal TOC pulse incorporated into surface sediments could be a dominant source of DOC to the estuary in the fall and that summer contributions are presumed to be from upstream DOM sources based on optical properties. Sediments leached more DOC under drought than non-drought conditions due to induced cracking in the sediment enhancing organic matter degradation. This study suggests the majority of DOM exported laterally from salt marshes comes from surface sediments (versus plant matter) and that temperature and sea-level rise could affect seasonal and drought pulses of DOC from the marsh.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have sediments that contain organic matter preserved against decomposition for timespans that can range up to millennia. This "blue carbon" in wetland sediments has been proposed as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and a potential source of greenhouse gases if coastal habitats are lost. A missing gap in the role of coastal habitats in the global carbon cycle is elucidating the fate of wetland sediment carbon following disturbance events, such as erosion, that can liberate organic matter to an oxygenated environment where decomposition can more readily occur. Here, we track the fate of previously stored salt marsh sediment by measuring the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during an oxygenated incubation. Sediments from two depth horizons (5-10 cm and 20-25 cm) were incubated at two temperatures (20 and 30 degrees C) for 161 days. Q(10) of the decomposition process over the entire course of the experiment was 2.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.2 +/- 0.2 for shallow and deep horizons, respectively. Activation energy for the decomposition reaction (49.7 kJ . mol(-1) and 58.8 kJ . mol(-1) for shallow and deep sediment horizons, respectively) was used to calculate temperature-specific decomposition rates that could be applied to environmental data. Using high-frequency water temperature data, this strategy was applied to coastal states in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where we estimated annual in situ decomposition of eroded salt marsh organic matter as 7-24% loss per year. We estimate 62.90 +/- 2.81 Gg C . yr(-1) is emitted from eroded salt marsh sediment decomposition in the CONUS.

AB  - Coastal wetlands including salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth. They are known for improving the quality of coastal water and provisioning coastal fisheries. However, this ecosystem is under potential threat due to urban coastal land reclamation, limited sediment supply, increased nutrient/eutrophication, and sea level rise. Therefore, restoration efforts to protect the degraded salt marsh habitat are considerably increasing worldwide. In this paper, we present an overview of salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. Published scientific literature in English language was collected by searching the most relevant keywords from popular search engines, namely, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Mendeley to get the information about salt marsh restoration techniques and success indicators. This study comprehensively reviewed data from 78 peer-reviewed papers. Results indicated that much of the salt marsh was restored through assisted abiotic strategies (e.g., recovery of tidal exchange, managed realignment, and sediment level amendment). A total of 214 indicators were found, spanning over six major ecological attributes such as structural diversity, ecosystem functions, physical conditions, species composition, external exchange, and absence of threat. Author keywords analysis revealed several hotspots for recent research (e.g., 16 s rRNA, fungi, microbial communities, carbon accumulation, and blue carbon).

AB  - Accumulation of significant quantities of organic matter is an important characteristic of anaerobic soils that influences the physical, chemical and biological processes of wetland ecosystems, Organic matter effects include soil water holding capacity, porosity, nutrient storage, nutrient cycling and species composition and abundance of sediment-dwelling invertebrates. These infauna are thought to be important links in transferring primary production from the marsh to the estuarine food web. Tidal marsh restoration and creation often occur on mineral soils that contain little or no organic carbon, and research results indicate that low SOM contents are associated with lower functional value of wetlands. The objectives of this paper are to review the literature and assess the relationship of SOM quantity and quality to functional value of created and restored tidal marshes relative to natural reference marshes. This assessment includes rate of accumulation of organic matter, comparison of carbon and nutrient pools in natural and created marshes, the relationship of organic matter to species composition and abundance of infauna, and the potential for accelerating functional development by adding organic amendments to the soil.

AB  - Secondarily treated municipal effluent has been discharged since 2006 into a 1439 ha cypress-tupelo forested wetland in coastal Louisiana. Changes in carbon stocks of trees and soils as well as emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were measured over a one-year period and compared to baseline conditions derived from the scientific literature. Methods and equations were applied from the American Carbon Registry (ACR) wetland carbon offset methodology 'Restoration of Degraded Deltaic Wetlands of the Mississippi Delta'. The cumulative carbon sequestered in the Project scenario was 4090 mt CO2e/y by trees and 13,752 mt CO2e/y by soils, while 32,982 mt CO2e/y of greenhouse gasses were emitted. The Baseline scenario sequestered 3790 mt CO2e/y by trees and 2435 mt CO2e/y by soils while emitting 70,870 mt CO2e/y in greenhouse gasses. The net difference between the Project and Baseline emissions was 11,617 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were omitted and 49,505 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were included. This study demonstrates the potential of using forested wetlands receiving treated municipal effluent for the net sequestration of carbon.

AB  - Enrichment of ecosystems with excess nutrients is occurring at an alarming rate and has fundamentally altered ecosystems worldwide. Salt marshes, which lie at the land-sea interface, are highly effective at removing anthropogenic nutrients through the action of macrophytes and through microbial processes in coastal sediments. The response of salt marsh bacteria to excess nitrogen has been documented; however, the role of fungi and their response to excess nitrogen in salt marsh sediments is not fully understood. Here, we document the response of salt marsh fungal communities to long-term excess nitrate in four distinct marsh habitats within a northern temperate marsh complex. We show that salt marsh fungal communities varied as a function of salt marsh habitat, with both fungal abundance and diversity increasing with carbon quantity. Nutrient enrichment altered fungal communities in all habitats through an increase in fungal abundance and the proliferation of putative fungal denitrifiers. Nutrient enrichment also altered marsh carbon quality in low marsh surface sediments where fungal response to nutrient enrichment was most dramatic, suggesting nutrient enrichment can alter organic matter quality in coastal sediments. Our results indicate that fungi, in addition to bacteria, likely play an important role in anaerobic decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter.

AB  - Coastal marine organisms experience dynamic pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions in their natural habitats, which may impact their susceptibility to long-term anthropogenic changes. Robust characterizations of all temporal scales of natural pH and DO fluctuations in different marine habitats are needed; however, appropriate time series of pH and DO are still scarce. We used multiyear (2008-2012), high-frequency (6 min) monitoring data to quantify diel, seasonal, and interannual scales of pH and DO variability in a productive, temperate tidal salt marsh (Flax Pond, Long Island, US). pH(NBS) and DO showed strong and similar seasonal patterns, with average (minimum) conditions declining from 8.2 (8.1) and 12.5 (11.4) mg l(-1) at the end of winter to 7.6 (7.2) and 6.3 (2.8) mg l(-1) in late summer, respectively. Concomitantly, average diel fluctuations increased from 0.22 and 2.2mg l(-1) (February) to 0.74 and 6.5 mg l(-1) (August), respectively. Diel patterns were modulated by tides and time of day, eliciting the most extreme minima when low tides aligned with the end of the night. Simultaneous in situ pCO(2) measurements showed striking fluctuations between similar to 330 and similar to 1,200 (early May), similar to 2,200 (mid June), and similar to 4,000 mu atm (end of July) within single tidal cycles. These patterns also indicate that the marsh's strong net heterotrophy influences its adjacent estuary by 'outwelling' acidified the coupled and fluctuating nature of pH and DO conditions in productive coastal and estuarine environments, which have yet to be adequately represented by experiments.

AB  - Gradual increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have resulted from the increased human use of fossil fuels since the beginning of industrial activity. In coastal wetland ecosystems, salt marshes constitute important habitats because they play important ecological roles, acting as carbon sinks by capturing atmospheric CO2 and storing it in living plant tissue. Ecological models are important tools for understanding the results of anthropogenic impacts on a global scale. Global warming poses threats to salt marshes through different effects, e.g., increases in sea level. The objectives of this study were i) to assess how temperature increases will influence the growth of salt marsh plants, ii) to infer the carbon budget of salt marshes under temperature increase scenarios and iii) to predict how salt marsh plants will keep pace with increases in sea level. These goals were achieved by developing growth models of three different plants (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus and Zostera noltei) found in the Mondego estuary. Models were developed for C-3 and C-4 plant species. The results suggest that a temperature increase enhances the aboveground biomass of salt marsh plants. According to the predictions of the models, the sedimentation rate of S. maritima and Z. noltei can keep pace with increases in sea level, but this is apparently not the case for S. maritimus. If S. maritimus disappears from the Mondego estuary, the carbon sequestration ability of the system should decrease due to the loss of active plant tissue. This conclusion is based on the fact that S. maritimus accumulated more than 80% of the total carbon sequestered in the tissues by the three studied species.

AB  - Salt-marsh accretion rate was investigated at sites that spanned a gradient in relative rate of sea-level rise in Washington and Oregon. Mean accretion rate over all sites was 3.6 mm yr-1 (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr-1), which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate (1.3 mm yr-1; sd = 0.6). However, a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr-1 (sd = 1.9) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate. Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate. Lowest accretion rates were recorded at sites with the least sediment supply. Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply. A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine predictions of the effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes form along coastlines and are very interesting ecosystems due to their function and services. In the future, salt marsh plants might provide food and medicine as crops irrigated via seawater in hyper arid regions. In the Arabian Gulf, little is known about salt marsh vegetation. Therefore, a targeted search on scientific literature was performed to provide a comprehensive assessment. Hence, current knowledge of the extent and status of salt marsh in the Arabian Gulf region was reviewed, based on literature-based analysis. Then, historic trends of salt marsh publications were carefully inspected. This study provides a list of salt marsh families and their genera and species, with a total of 51 family 179 genera 316 species in the Arabian Gulf. The largest family was Chenopodiaceae followed by Poaceae, Asteraceae. Moreover, this study identified some of the gaps that could help future directions for scientific research, and help making decisions of conservation, management policies and procedures.

AB  - Whether and how the roles of environmental factors in producing vegetation patterns in coastal marshes vary with spatial scale is not well understood. We investigated the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors in the Yangtze estuary at three spatial scales. Plant communities and edaphic factors were quantified at high and low tidal levels in both freshwater and salt marshes. Canonical correspondence analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between plant communities and edaphic factors at the landscape scale (freshwater vs. salt marsh), the zonation scale (high vs. low tidal level) and the patch scale (dominant vs. other species). Soil salinity, moisture content, pH, bulk density, and organic carbon could well explain segregations of plants at the landscape and zonation scales. However, the same factors exhibited only very weak relationships to plant communities at the patch scale. These results suggest that plant communities in the Yangtze estuary are segregated at different spatial scales by different environmental factors. As spatial scale is often not explicitly addressed investigating community assembly rules, our study underscores the importance of scaling for an improved understanding of community organization in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted using salt marsh cores to determine the oxygen demand exerted by spilled crude oil and fertilizers added to stimulate biodegradation. Measurements of oxygen uptake and CO2 efflux in flooded and non-flooded cores were conducted in addition to measurements of the magnitude and depth distribution of sulfate reduction rates using (SO42-)-S-35. Additions of crude oil and fertilizers increased sediment oxygen demand (SOD) by a factor of 1.5 to through a combination of enhanced aerobic respiration and sulfate reduction. A strong dependency was observed between the oxygen demand and the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration when crude oil and fertilizers were added. Oiled,Fertilized cores did nor exhibit an SOD higher than control cores when overlying dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 5 mg/l. Crude oil stimulated sulfate reduction rates by a factor of two under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Highest sulfate reduction rates were observed in the top 2cm of marsh. Oxygen demand was apportioned between sulfide oxidation and aerobic respiration. Appointment of SOD indicated that despite doubling of the sulfate reduction rate, most of the demand in non-flooded cores (65%) is exerted by aerobic respiration with the majority of this demand exerted by hydrocarbon degrading organisms. When examined together, data indicate that significant biodegradation of crude oil in salt marshes occurs only when the tidal cycle exposes the surface of the salt marsh to the atmosphere.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes, which provide valuable ecosystem services such as flood mitigation and carbon sequestration, are threatened by rising sea level. In response, these ecosystems migrate landward, converting available upland into salt marsh. In the coastal-plain surrounding Chesapeake Bay, United States, conversion of coastal forest to salt marsh is well-documented and may offset salt marsh loss due to sea level rise, sediment deficits, and wave erosion. Land slope at the marsh-forest boundary is an important factor determining migration likelihood, however, the standard method of using field measurements to assess slope across the marsh-forest boundary is impractical on the scale of an estuary. Therefore, we developed a general slope quantification method that uses high resolution elevation data and a repurposed shoreline analysis tool to determine slope along the marsh-forest boundary for the entire Chesapeake Bay coastal-plain and find that less than 3% of transects have a slope value less than 1%; these low slope environments offer more favorable conditions for forest to marsh conversion. Then, we combine the bay-wide slope and elevation data with inundation modeling from Hurricane Isabel to determine likelihood of coastal forest conversion to salt marsh. This method can be applied to local and estuary-scale research to support management decisions regarding which upland forested areas are more critical to preserve as available space for marsh migration.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes consist of a mosaic of vegetated and open water features, which naturally evolve and change over time. However, the rapid expansion of open water areas has been associated with marsh degradation and there is a growing need for detailed studies as coastal wetlands continue to degrade under increasing rates of sea level rise and related stressors. Yet, few studies investigate soil physicochemical and biogeochemical properties within different marsh landscape features, which could provide insight into mechanisms of the formation and expansion of open water areas. The current study compared wetland soil physical and microbial properties observed in vegetated areas with shallow open water areas called panties, identifying a number of significant differences. Panne soils possessed lower bulk density, total C, N, P, SOC, DOC, and SRP compared with vegetated marsh areas, suggesting a shift in nutrient pools as vegetated areas transition into shallow open water features. Panne features also displayed significantly lower microbial pool sizes and processing rates than vegetated marsh soils, suggesting reduced capacity for nutrient processing in open water areas. Further, extractable NH4-N was highest in the panne soils suggesting that the absence of macrophytes decreased N uptake in open water areas. Also related to the lack of vascular plants, extractable DOC in panties averaged less than half the concentration found in vegetated marsh areas, despite a smaller difference in soil total C. Results underscore the importance of incorporating heterogeneous landscape soil conditions when evaluating marsh degradation and considering potential restoration activities.

AB  - Offering remarkable biodiversity, coastal salt marshes also provide a wide variety of ecosystem services: cultural services (leisure, tourist amenities), supply services (crop production, pastoralism) and regulation services including carbon sequestration and natural protection against coastal erosion and inundation. The consideration of this coastal protection ecosystem service takes part in a renewed vision of coastal risk management and especially marine flooding, with an emerging focus on "nature-based solutions." Through this work, using remote-sensing methods, we propose a novel drone-based spatial modeling methodology of the salt marsh hydrodynamic attenuation at very high spatial resolution (VHSR). This indirect modeling is based on in situ measurements of significant wave heights (Hm(0)) that constitute the ground truth, as well as spectral and topographical predictors from VHSR multispectral drone imagery. By using simple and multiple linear regressions, we identify the contribution of predictors, taken individually, and jointly. The best individual drone-based predictor is the green waveband. Dealing with the addition of individual predictors to the red-green-blue (RGB) model, the highest gain is observed with the red edge waveband, followed by the near-infrared, then the digital surface model. The best full combination is the RGB enhanced by the red edge and the normalized difference vegetation index (coefficient of determination (R-2): 0.85, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.20%/m).

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, affected by plant invasion, are not fully understood. In this study, the impact of 10 years Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil organic matter (SOM), labile, and recalcitrant pools was examined comparing with bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities in tidal salt marshes of the Eastern Chinese coast. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly raised C and N concentrations in SOM, labile and recalcitrant pools compared to bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils. Spartina alterniflora soil had higher recalcitrant index for C relative to bare flat. The proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C and the decomposition rate of old C in the labile pool were significantly higher than those in the recalcitrant pool. However, the S. alterniflora-derived C stock of the recalcitrant pool was much greater than that of the labile pool. The SOM and recalcitrant pools in S. alterniflora soil had significantly higher delta N-15 levels compared with bare flat, indicating an increased N loss following S. alterniflora invasion. The results suggested that short- term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enlarged soil organic C and N pools via altering SOM input and decomposition.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of hydroperiod on soil organic matter quality in three different salt marshes in the Baiona lagoon (N Italy) representing terrestrial, intertidal and subaqueous ecosystems in the area. The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter (SOM). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the SOM by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic SOM sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and SOM is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, DRIFT spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils (SASs), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological SOM transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the SOM. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of SOM under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.

AB  - Geomorphology, vegetation and tidal fluxes are usually identified as the factors introducing variation in the flushing of particulate organic matter (POM) from tidal marshes to adjacent waters. Such variables may, however, be insufficient to explain export characteristics in marshes inhabited by ecosystem engineers that can alter the quantity and quality of POM on the marsh surface that is subject to tidal flushing. In this study we evaluated the balance between transfer of buried sedimentary organic carbon (C) to the marsh surface due to crab excavation (measured from the mounds of sediment excavated from burrows) and outputs of C from the surface due to sediment deposition within crab burrows (estimated from sediment deposited within PVC burrow mimics), in a Southwestern Atlantic salt marsh supporting dense (approximately 70 ind m(-2)) populations of the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus. C excavation by crabs was much greater than deposition of C within crab burrow mimics. Per area unit estimates of the balance between these two processes indicated that crabs excavated 5.98 g m(2) d(-1) and 4.80 mg m(-2) d(-1) of total and readily (10 d) labile C, respectively. However, sediments excavated by crabs showed a significantly lower content of both total and readily-labile C than sediment collected in burrow mimics. This indicates that ecosystem engineering by burrowing crabs causes a net decrease in the concentration of C in the superficial sediment layers and, thus, an overall decrease in the amount of C that can be washed out of the marsh by tidal action. Incorporating the in situ activities of ecosystem engineers in models of marsh export should enhance understanding of the function of marshes in estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S) in bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and white perch Morons americana from Delaware Bay were a function of capture location and, for restored tidal salt marshes, possibly a function of the relative position of the marsh restoration trajectory. White perch collected in polyhaline restoration and reference (Moore's Beach) sites had stable isotope signatures that reflected contributions from both benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. Isotope values from white perch captured at the reference site were slightly enriched compared with those captured at the restoration sites. At upper estuary oligo-mesohaline locations, Phragmites australis contributed to the isotopic composition of both species. Although P. australis was not dominant at the reference marsh (Mad Horse Creek), it also seemed to influence the dow of nutrients into these species. White perch were not collected in open waters of Delaware Bay, but bay anchovy were abundant at offshore sampling stations. A striking result of this study was that stable isotopes that originated in macrophytes and benthic microalgae of salt marshes occurred ubiquitously among bay anchovy collected several kilometers from shore. Interestingly, fish from Mad Horse Creek, a reference marsh where Phragmites was abundant only along creek banks, were intermediate in their isotopic composition. Although benthic microalgal signatures varied both within and among sites, the isotopic composition of bay anchovy and white perch was clearly influenced by these primary producers across all marsh types. Particulate organic matter (POM) appeared to play a lesser role in bay anchovy and white perch nutrition, although depletion of POM sulfur due to the presence of inorganic sulfur may have led to underestimates of the contribution of phytoplankton. Further studies are required to elucidate the relative role of phytoplankton in the trophodynamics of these species.

AB  - The influence of salt marsh on estuarine bacterioplankton was investigated in two estuaries with different hydrodynamic characteristics (Ria de Aveiro and Tagus Estuary). In the Ria de Aveiro, bacteria in the flood water overlying the marsh were two times more abundant and five to six times more active than in the main channel. In the Tagus Estuary, bacterial abundance was similar in flooding and channel water, but bacterial activity was up to two times higher in the main channel. The two salt marshes have distinct influences on estuarine bacterioplankton abundance and activity. In the Ria de Aveiro, salt marsh enhanced estuarine bacterial communities, increasing their size and stimulating their activity. By contrast, the salt marsh in the Tagus Estuary does not seem to increase the bacterial abundance and production in the channel water. These distinct influences may be explained by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the salt marshes, which were confirmed by the hydrodynamic model implemented for both systems.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora was planted in the Jiangsu Province, China, in 1982; however, its effects on ecological processes in the local intertidal ecosystem are not well understood. To estimate the effects of S. alterniflora salt marshes on the intertidal zones of Jiangsu Province, the following work was done: (1) the area of S. alterniflora salt marsh expansion from 1985 to 2004 was obtained, as was the total net primary production (TNPP) and CO2 fixation of the salt marshes, (2) bulk density and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the S. alterniflora salt marshes and in mudflats were determined, and (3) total soil organic carbon in the top 20 cm of sediment (TSOC) in S. alterniflora salt marshes and mudflats was estimated and compared.
   During the past 22 years, the area of S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province increased by 1875 times. Accordingly, the total net primary production (TNPP) of the S. alterniflora salt marshes in the Jiangsu Province added up to 3760 million kg, and CO2 fixed by the S. alterniflora salt marshes amounted to 3130 million kg over the 22 years. A significant difference was found between bulk density in three research sites (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA), and the SOC in S. alterniflora salt marshes was significantly higher than that in mudflats (n = 20, p < 0.05, ANOVA). TSOC in 2004 was 247 million kg in S. alterniflora salt marshes and 164 million kg in mudflats, indicating that 83 million kg of organic carbon was sequestrated into the soil pool because of planting S. alterniflora. These results imply that S. alterniflora enhanced the carbon sink capacity of the intertidal ecosystem in the Jiangsu Province, positive contribution to alleviating CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

AB  - In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil-plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7 T y(-1)) and nitrogen (78.3 T y(-1), 85% N-NO3- and 15% organic-N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5 T y(-1) of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1 T y(-1) of nitrogen, 57% N-NH4+ and 43% organic-N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87 T y(-1) and 0.97 T y(-1), respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocadon of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, pH, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595 g m(-2) y(-1)), above-ground (2610 g m(-2) y(-1)) and litter (260 g m(-2) y(-1)). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.

AB  - Characteristics and tidal flat trends of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover were studied for the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, based on analyses of stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13), grain sizes and contents of particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen (TN) and inorganic carbon (TIC) for three cores excavated from high tidal flat, middle tidal flat and bare flat. Results demonstrate that correlations between soil POC contents and delta C-13 values of the salt marsh cores were similar to those between soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and delta C-13 values of the upper soil layers of mountainous soil profiles with different altitudes. SOM of salt marsh was generally younger than 100 years, and originated mainly from topsoil erosions in catchments of the Yangtze River. Correlations of TN content with C/N ratio, POC content with TIC content and POC content with delta C-13 values for the cores suggest that turnover degrees of SOM from the salt marsh are overall low, and trends of SOM turnover are clear from the bare flat to the high tidal flat. Bare flat samples show characteristics of original sediments, with minor SOM turnover. Turnover processes of SOM have occurred and are discernable in the high and middle tidal flats, and the mixing degrees of SOM compartments with different turnover rates increase with evolution of the muddy tidal flat. The exclusive strata structure of alternate muddy laminae and silty laminae originated from dynamic depositional processes on muddy tidal flat was a great obstacle to vertical migration of dissolved materials, and SOM turnover was then constrained. The muddy tidal flat processes exerted direct influences on sequestration and turnover of SOM in the salt marsh, and had great constraints on the spatial and temporal characteristics of SOM turnover of the Chongmingdongtan Salt Marsh in the Yangtze River estuary.

AB  - Dissolved lignin-derived compounds in seawater indicate the presence of organic matter originating from vascular plants and therefore from terrestrial (upland and coastal marsh) ecosystems. We used a hydrophobic resin to concentrate lignin-rich humic substances and to determine concentrations of lignin oxidation products (vanillyl lignin phenols) for waters of the continental shelf of the southeastern U.S. Lignin phenol concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 4.2-mu-g liter-1 and accounted for 0.002-0.13% of the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in continental shelf waters. Dissolved lignin concentrations were generally highest near the shore and in those areas receiving greatest river and marsh discharge. Concentrations varied on both short-term (weekly) and seasonal time scales, however, indicating that the contribution of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter to the C budget of the shelf is quite variable. Salinity (> 31 parts per thousand) was significantly correlated (negatively) with lignin phenol concentrations during three of four cruises, suggesting largely conservative mixing of lignin-derived material on the shelf In selected rivers and salt marshes contributing terrestrially derived organic matter to the continental shelf, lignin phenol C accounted for 0.14-1.0% of the DOC. A simple mixing model which assumes no biological or physical sinks of lignin-derived material during transport from terrestrial sources to the shelf predicts that an average of 6-36% of nearshore DOC derives from terrestrial ecosystems, depending on whether the terrestrial end-member (lignin source) is assumed to be a river or a salt marsh, while 5-26% of inner shelf DOC and 3-18% of mid- to outer-shelf DOC is of terrestrial origin.

AB  - Pulsed emission of CO2 following rainfall in terrestrial ecosystems is well characterized, but coastal wetlands show the opposite trend for CO2, and less is known about the responses of other biogenic greenhouse gases like CH4 and N2O. Tidal inundation in coastal wetlands such as salt marshes is an additional form of rewetting with the potential to cause biological pulses that may not resemble rain-induced pulses. Accurately predicting the carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marshes requires estimates of pulse responses to both rainfall and tidal inundation, in addition to baseline greenhouse gas flux rates. We measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes from salt marsh sediment cores while we simulated rewetting by rainfall and/or tidal inundation, and we measured the total and potentially-active microbial communities at the end of the experiment. Rewetting from tidal inundation and from rainfall led to a short term (begun within 1 h, concluded within similar to 1 d) pulse of N2O, a sustained drop in CO2 emission, but no change in CH4. The N2O pulse peaked on average at 20x and 10x baseline flux rates after tidal inundation and rainfall respectively. Peak N2O fluxes far exceeded the highest emission observed in field measurements at these sites. By global warming potential, the pulse of N2O only slightly offset the drop in CO2 emission, therefore rewetting had a net cooling effect on marsh radiative forcing. Microbial communities were similar in rewetted and non-rewetted cores two days after rewetting, which reflects rapid recovery and/or resilience of the community to rewetting. We estimated the contribution of pulsed vs. baseline N2O emissions to annual totals by modelling rewetting events over 65-year tide gauge and precipitation records, and found that pulsed emissions constitute the majority of salt marsh N2O emissions, and could constitute the entirety in marshes with a net-sink baseline.

AB  - Salt marshes are under increasing anthropogenic pressures that have been reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis, which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the summer of 2010 in four creeks from two sites from Western France (the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay and the Seine Estuary). Analysis was undertaken using C and N stable-isotope compositions. Tested response variables (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase in the Mont-Saint Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays, with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea bass and the thinlip mullet was unchanged by local salt marsh vegetation, and considered consistent with their diet. This study highlights the relevance of stable-isotopes analyses for assessing long-term and integrative effects of changes in vegetation resulting from human disturbances in salt marshes.

AB  - The carbon cycle is significantly affected by Spartina alterniflora invasion through its impact on blue carbon in many salt marshes. To determine the impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC), we studied the vertical and horizontal distribution of SOC. And stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the impact of the age of S. alterniflora invasion on SOC in Chongming Dongtan wetland located in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The results showed that the SOC concentration was higher in the S. alterniflora community than that in the native Phragmites australis community. The age of invasion and the SOC concentration increased with increasing elevation, while the SOC concentration decreased with increasing soil depth. The delta C-13 value became less negative at greater depth, which was related to the contribution from C-13-enriched carbon sources after 3 years of invasion. After 7 and 10 years, the delta(13)value became more negative at greater depth in both communities. S. alterniflora had a positive effect on the soil carbon pool, and its contribution was related to soil depth. In the low tidal marshes, the contribution of S. alterniflora was negatively correlated with soil depth, while it was positively correlated with soil depth in the high tidal marshes. The results from this study will contribute to improved understanding of future ecological consequences.

AB  - We examined the impact of long-term cattle grazing on soil processes and microbial activity in a temperate salt marsh. Soil conditions, microbial biomass and respiration, mineralization and denitrification rates were measured in upper salt marsh that had been ungrazed or cattle grazed for several decades. Increased microbial biomass and soil respiration were observed in grazed marsh, most likely stimulated by enhanced rates of root turnover and root exudation. We found a significant positive effect of grazing on potential N mineralization rates measured in the laboratory, but this difference did not translate to in situ net mineralization measured monthly from May to September. Rates of denitrification were lowest in the grazed marsh and appeared to be limited by nitrate availability, possibly due to more anoxic conditions and lower rates of nitrification. The major effect of grazing on N cycling therefore appeared to be in limiting losses of N through denitrification, which may lead to enhanced nutrient availability to saltmarsh plants, but a reduced ability of the marsh to act as a buffer for land-derived nutrients to adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, we investigated if grazing influences the rates of turnover of labile and refractory C in saltmarsh soils by adding (14)C-labelled leaf litter or root exudates to soil samples and monitoring the evolution of (14)CO(2). Grazing had little effect on the rates of mineralization of (14)C used as a respiratory substrate, but a larger proportion of (14)C was partitioned into microbial biomass and immobilized in long- and medium-term storage pools in the grazed treatment. Grazing slowed down the turnover of the microbial biomass, which resulted in longer turnover times for both leaf litter and root exudates. Grazing may therefore affect the longevity of C in the soil and alter C storage and utilization pathways in the microbial community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal marshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that are often considered as hot-spots of atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.

AB  - Recent empirical and theoretical approaches have called for an understanding of the processes underpinning ecosystem service provision. Environmental gradients have shown effects on key plant functional traits that subsequently explain ecosystem properties of several systems. However, little is known concerning how associations between plant functional traits, including both below- and aboveground plant components, predict ecosystem properties and independently measured final ecosystem services. Here, we modeled (1) the responses of the leaf and plant economics spectrum, Plant size axis, and root growth to environmental gradients and (2) how associations between plant functional traits explain trade-offs and synergies between multiple ecosystem properties and final services. Forty-four plots were studied in a coastal marsh landscape of the German North Sea Coast. We used a partial least square structural equation model approach to test the hypothesized model. We found (1) a negative covariation between plant traits pertaining to a size axis and traits explaining both plant growth (roots and stems) and the leaf economics spectrum; (2) this trade-off responded significantly to the land use gradient and nutrient availability, which were both strongly driven by the groundwater gradient; (3) this trade-off explained an initial major trade-off between carbon stocks, at one extreme of the axis, and both the habitat value to conserve endangered plants and forage production for meat and dairy products at the other extreme. However, a secondary trade-off between nature conservation value and forage production, explained by a trade-off between leaf economics spectrum and plant growth in response to the land use intensity gradient, was also found.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is outwelled from highly productive salt marshes, but its sources and fates are unclear. To examine common salt marsh plants as sources of coastal DOM, two dominant salt marsh vascular plants Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemarianus, and two major coastal seagrasses Syringodium filiforme and Halodule wrightii, were collected from a Florida salt marsh and studied using laboratory incubation experiments. We investigated the leaching dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from these plants, in conjunction with our field investigations of the sources and outwelling of DOM from Florida salt marshes. The leaching of DOM and CDOM from the plants was a rapid process, and leaching rates were 65-288 A mu M/g dry weight/day for DOC and 3.8-16 A mu M/g dry weight/day for TDN from different plants in the bacteria-inhibited incubations. DOC was proportional to TDN in the leachates, but the quantity of C and N leached was dependent on the species and growth stage of the plants. At the end of the 25-day experiments, 5.4-23 % and 10-45 % of solid phase C and N were released into DOC and TDN pools, respectively. Bacteria played an important role during the leaching process. The majority of DOC and TDN leached from marsh plants and seagrasses was labile and highly biodegradable with 56-90 % of the leached DOC and 44-72 % of the leached TDN being decomposed at the end of the experiments. The fluorescence measurements of CDOM indicate that organic matter leached from marsh plants and seagrasses contained mainly protein-like DOM which was degraded rapidly by bacteria. Our study suggests that leaching of DOM from salt marsh plants and seagrasses provide not only major sources of DOC, TDN, and CDOM that affect many biogeochemical processes, but also as important food sources to microbial communities in the marsh and adjacent coastal waters.

AB  - Introductions of exotic plants are widespread ecological threats disturbing the carbon and nutrient cycles in global coastal wetlands. Previous studies have found that the invasion has enhanced methane emission through increased primary production and a changed methanogenic pathway. However, the previous studies did not determine the depth profiles of the changes while the depth in the soil profile to which the disturbance propagates is one of the critical issues to be addressed. In this study, we illustrated the depth profiles of the effect of the introductions of S. anglica and P. australis on the potential methane production, soil biogeochemistry, and soil microbial community which play a substantial role in enhanced methane emission due to the invasions. The in situ field measurements and anaerobic incubation were conducted to determine the mechanistic differences of depth profiles. Both introductions of S. anglica and P. australis increased methane emission through different microbial mechanisms depending on depth profile. Potential methane production was stimulated in shallow and deep soil layer of S. anglica and P. australis-introduced marshes, respectively. S. anglica increased the contribution of methylotrophic methanogenesis in top soil layers while P. australis decreased competitive inhibition by sulfate reducers in all soil layers. These results emphasize the importance of below-ground microbial activity and vertical distribution in carbon cycles in tidal marshes. Further plant invasion studies should focus on depth profiles of microbial processes, as their distribution and activity vary substantially across soil depths.

AB  - Two cordgrass species of the genus Spartina cohabit in SW Atlantic (southern Brazil 31 degrees 48' S to Argentinean Patagonia, 43 degrees 20' S) salt marshes. Some salt marshes are dominated by the dense-flowered cordgrass Spartina densiflora (which inhabits the upper intertidal level) and others by the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora (which inhabits the lower intertidal level). We investigated how the different species dominance affects the detritus dynamics in the Bahia Blanca estuary (38 degrees 47' S. 62 degrees 20' W Argentina). Field measurements of annual detritus production using destructive methods show that both plants are similar. However, detritus of S. alterniflora shows higher decomposition rates than that of S. densiflora. This difference may be due to a larger N content, lower lignocellulose content and lower C/N ratio of S. alterniflora when compared with S. densiflora. Moreover, field sampling shows that S. alterniflora has a larger amount of trapped litter that, according to the litterbag method, has higher decomposition rates. Therefore it is highly likely that S. alterniflora salt marshes contribute towards more profitable detritus for estuarine food webs than marshes dominated by S. densiflora. These results illustrate that the composition of the coastal plant community can determine the quality and profitability of the detritus that support estuarine food webs. They also illustrate that salt marshes belonging to a same biogeographic group and even coexisting in great proximity can have very different ecosystemic roles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we examined the phenology of the salt marsh ecosystem across coastal Louisiana (LA) for a 16-year time period (2000-2015) using NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer's (MODIS) eight-day average surface reflectance images (500 m). We compared the performances of least squares fitted asymmetric Gaussian (AG) and double logistic (DL) smoothing functions in terms of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio from the raw phenology derived from the time-series composites. We performed derivative analysis to determine the appropriate start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) thresholds. After that, we extracted the seasonality parameters in TIMESAT, and studied the effect of environmental disturbances/anomalies on the seasonality parameters. Finally, we performed trend analysis using the derived seasonality parameters such as base green biomass (GBM) value, maximum GBM value, seasonal amplitude, and small seasonal integral. Based on root mean square error (RMSE) values and residual plots, we selected the best thresholds for SOS (5% of amplitude) and EOS (20% of amplitude), along with the best smoothing function. The selected SOS and EOS thresholds were able to capture the environmental disturbances that have affected the salt marsh ecosystem during the 16-year time period. Our trend analysis results indicate positive trends in the base GBM values in the salt marshes of LA. However, we did not notice as much of a positive trend in the maximum GBM levels. Hence, we observed mostly negative changes in the GBM amplitude and small seasonal integral values. These negative changes indicated the overall progressive decline in the rates of photosynthesis and biomass allocation in the LA salt marsh ecosystem, which is most likely due to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and sea level rise. The results illustrate both the relative efficiency of MODIS-based biophysical models for analyzing salt marsh phenology, and performances of the smoothing techniques in terms of improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the MODIS-derived phenology.

AB  - Ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes are defined as areas of halophytic, terrestrial vegetation which are periodically flooded by the tide and have a predominant underlying organic substrate comprising of wood and/or Sphagnum peat that formed under freshwater conditions. The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including pH, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes. The findings confirm that the high organic matter content of ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes is associated with distinct vegetation composition.

AB  - One of the most important reasons stated in legislation for protecting salt marshes is their support of commercially and recreationally important nekton (fish and crustaceans). Yet, there is a surprising level of uncertainty among scientists regarding the role of salt marshes in supporting secondary production. The emphasis has been on "marine transient" species (in earlier literature often referred to as "estuarine dependent") because they have life histories that seem designed to place young-of-the-year or juveniles in marsh habitats and because these species are often of commercial or recreational value. Salt marshes are believed to provide: 1) trophic support resulting in high growth rates, 2) increased survivorship due to lowered mortality, and 3) a suitable physico-chemical environment for development of young fishes. In this paper, we consider the evidence for each of these, with an emphasis on the trophic and survivorship aspects. The seasonally warmer temperatures of estuaries and salt marsh creeks apparently provide a metabolic advantage that supports high growth rates. The influence of marsh-derived organic matter in estuarine food webs is apparent, and its importance to marine transient fishes is supported by dietary, behavioral, and isotopic evidence. The major pathways by which marsh organic matter is transferred to fish are largely indirect, through microbial and invertebrate intermediaries. Invertebrates are the primary link to fish consumers of marsh-associated production, transforming microphytes, organic detritus, and microbial detrital heterotrophs into available biomass. Although most detrital organic carbon entering salt marsh systems, mainly from emergent grasses, is apparently respired by heterotrophs, the support of consumers by marsh plant detritus and microalgae can be equally important. The use of salt marsh detritus in food webs usually occurs in close proximity to the salt marsh indicating that outwelling of salt marsh organic matter offshore is not the dominant way that salt marshes support offshore fisheries. Salt marsh support of offshore fisheries is more probably by direct export of juvenile fish biomass and a trophic relay involving ontogenetic and cyclic migrations of nekton species, rather than export of organic detritus. Understanding the controls on marine transient fish mortality is probably the most problematic and least studied aspect of their ecology. The few estimates of mortality rates of fishes in estuaries are as high as, or higher than, mortality rates of fishes in other marine and Freshwater ecosystems. However, because of faster growth rates, fish spend less rime in the small stages with the higher mortality rates. Within estuaries, mortality rates for some species, but not all, are lower in marsh creeks compared to more open areas. The value of marshes as refuge habitat is probably due to the interaction of temperature, turbidity, and vegetative structure in restricting the foraging of piscine predators.

AB  - Long-term closure of the Kobonqaba Estuary mouth to the sea resulted in high water levels, inundation of pneumatophores and die-back of the mangroves specifically, Avicennia marina. The recovery of the mangroves was measured by assessing changes in vegetation cover and sediment characteristics along transects and all mangroves present in the estuary were described in terms of height, diameter at breast height and phenology. Measurements were made in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015. Surviving adult trees were producing propagules and showed that the forest would be able to regenerate if the seedlings established and were able to survive the environmental conditions. However there may be competition from salt marsh plants which increased in average cover from 0% in 2011 to 18.9% (2013) and 50% in 2015. Sediment characteristics changed over the study period with more oxic conditions in 2013 and 2015 (57.6 and 62.3 mV) compared to 2011 and 2012 (-189 to -148 mV) and organic matter decreased from 18.4% in 2011 to 9.8% in 2015. High initial porewater nutrient concentrations in 2013 promoted salt marsh growth. A particular sequence of events was recorded for the establishment of salt marsh in this previous mangrove habitat where stabilization of sediment by microphytobenthos and macroalgae was the key to further colonization by emergent macrophytes.

AB  - Due to the enhanced organic matter decomposition induced by climate warming as well as increased external nitrogen (N) inputs, increased soil N availability in wetlands can alter soil enzyme activities and hence ecosystem C dynamics. An incubation experiment was conducted to assess the effects of increased N availability on soil enzyme activities in freshwater marsh and peatland of Northeast China. N was added as ammonium nitrate solution at four levels (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg N/g soil for N0, N1, N2, and N3, respectively). Results showed that the effect of N availability increasing on soil enzyme activities varied with soil types, fertilization rates, and incubation times. Increased N availability inhibited urease activity in marsh soils throughout the incubation, whereas N2 and N3 treatments suppressed urease activity in peat soils only at 6 days. Marsh soil invertase activity increased after 15 days of incubation because of N addition. N availability increasing stimulated the peat soil protease activity initially, but negative effect was observed at the end of incubation. In both soils, increased N availability had no effect on acid phosphatase except for N3 treatment at 27 days. With increased N addition levels, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased in marsh soils, but did not change in peat soils. These findings suggest that, in marsh ecosystems, increased N availability alters soil urease and invertase activities and DOC pool, and thus changes the soil organic C dynamics. However, soil urease and DOC are not sensitive to N availability increasing in peat soils.

AB  - To obtain information on food web structure in salt marshes of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Estuary, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of primary producers and consumers were determined. The mean delta C-13 values of 31 dominant consumers ranged from -23.13 parts per thousand to -14.37 parts per thousand. Except for several species (Eriocheir sinensis, Sinonovacula constricta and Potamocorbula ustulata), consumers had intermediate delta C-13 values between those of benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. The mean delta N-15 values of 31 dominant consumers varied between 6.87 parts per thousand and 13.33 parts per thousand, which indicate three trophic levels in salt marshes of the Changjiang River Estuary. A total of 18 macroinvertebrates species and four fish species represented primary consumers with trophic levels ranging from 2.0 to 2.7. Secondary consumers included two macroinvertebrates and seven fishes with trophic levels varying between 3.0 and 3.9. The consumers were divided into three trophic guilds, i.e., detritivorous/algae feeders, omnivores and carnivores. The detrital food chain was the main energy flow pathway in the salt marsh food web of the Changjiang River Estuary, and the marsh vascular plants were at least as equally important as microphytobenthos for secondary production. The important trophic function of the salt marsh habitats in the estuary is revealed.

AB  - Recent studies have shownthe effect of nitrate (NO3-) on carbon gas emissions from wetland soils that contradict thermodynamic predictions. In this study, CO2 production in three Mississippi River deltaic plain wetland soils (forest swamp, freshwater and saline marshes) with the presence of different NO3- levels (0.2, 2.0, and 3.2 mM) was evaluated in an anaerobic microcosm. Molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of these soils was investigated using pyrolysis-GC/MS, and soil microbial community was characterized based on phosphorus lipid fatty acid (PLFA) method to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Addition of NO3- promoted CO2 production in swamp forest soil, but inhibited CO2 emission from marsh soils. Pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis showed that swamp soil contained more polysaccharides, whereas both marsh soils had high abundance of phenolic compounds. Total PLFAs of forest swamp soil were 34% and 66% higher than freshwater and saline marsh soils, respectively. The PLFA profiles indicated different microbial distribution along a salinity gradient with the forest swamp having a higher proportion of fungi and NO3- reducers but lower sulfate (SO42-) reducers than marsh soils. Overall, the study indicated that the inherent differences in soil DOM and microbial community led to the contrasting response in soil CO2 respiration between forest swamp and marsh ecosystems to NO3- loading. These differences should be considered in determining the fate of nitrate entering Louisiana coastal wetlands from river diversions and other sources and their management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Salt marshes have among the highest carbon (C) burial rates of any ecosystem and often rely on C accumulation to gain elevation and persist in locations with accelerating sea level rise. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), the accumulation or loss of C resulting from vertical CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes, lateral C fluxes, and sediment C inputs, varies across salt marshes; thus, extrapolation of NECB to an entire marsh is challenging. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to salt marshes impact NECB by influencing each component of NECB, but differences in the impacts of fertilization between edge and interior marsh must be considered when scaling up. NECB was estimated for the 0.5 km(2) Spartina alterniflora marsh area of Freeman Creek, NC, under control and fertilized conditions at both interior and edge berm sites. Annual CO2 fluxes were nearly balanced at control sites, but fertilization significantly increased net CO2 emissions at edge sites. Lateral C export, modeled using respiration rates, represented a significant C loss that increased with fertilization in both edge and interior marsh. Sediment C input was a significant C source in the interior, nearly doubling with fertilization, but represented a small source on the edge. When extrapolating C exchanges to the entire marsh, including edge which comprised 17% of the marsh area, the marsh displayed net loss of C despite a net C gain in the interior. Fertilization increased net C loss fivefold. Extrapolation of NECB to whole marshes requires inclusion of C fluxes for both edge and interior marsh.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marsh ecosystems rely on carbon accumulation to increase elevation and survive sea level rise. The amount of carbon accumulated in a marsh is the net result of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, fixation of carbon by photosynthesis, export of dissolved carbon to the creek, and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments deposited on the surface. Because each component varies between edge and interior marsh, it is challenging to estimate carbon accumulation for a whole marsh system. It is not currently known how increasing nitrogen pollution impacts carbon accumulation for a whole marsh. To find out, we compared measurements of carbon accumulation in fertilized and unfertilized plots in the edge and interior of a salt marsh at Freeman Creek, North Carolina, USA. Overall, the marsh gained carbon in the interior but lost carbon on the edge, leading to a loss of about 50,000 kg C year(-1) across the 0.5 km(2) marsh area. However, under fertilized conditions, Freeman Creek marsh carbon loss increased nearly fivefold overall as a result of the large increase in carbon loss from the edge marsh. This study shows that increasing nitrogen pollution in coastal waters will cause increasing net carbon loss in marshes.

AB  - Sediment-dwelling fauna are a ubiquitous component of salt marshes yet we have limited understanding of their roles in marsh functioning and of the environmental conditions that control their distributions and abundances. This paper examines the influence of vegetation (presence, type, density, and biomass) and other environmental variables (marsh age, sediment and porewater properties, elevation, flow, oxygen, and biogenic structures) on salt marsh macrofauna and meiofauna. We review studies from a variety of geographical locations and include new information from systems with adjacent natural and restored sites in southern California. The influence of environmental factors on faunal assemblages varies with marsh system, factor intensity or concentration, taxon studied, and with other interacting factors present. We hypothesize a hierarchy of environmental variables in which abiotic properties such as marsh age, elevation and salinity act over large space and time scales, and are most likely to influence the presence or absence of species. Sediment properties (organic matter and particle size) and vegetation presence or type act on intermediate scales affecting macrofaunal abundance and composition. Plant biomass, culms and biogenic structures generated by fauna are patchy and act on small scales, often interacting with flow, to affect distribution and abundance patterns. Resolution of these processes in salt marshes should improve our understanding of controls on invertebrate communities and will ultimately aid the conservation and restoration of salt marsh habitat.

AB  - In order to explore the impact of land-use change on carbon (C) stocks in South West England, three scenarios were explored based on current UK national- and regional-scale policies and plans. The scenarios assessed were: (i) Rebuilding Biodiversity (RB), involving habitat restoration of 824,244 ha of strategic nature areas; (ii) Forest Strategy (FS), involving establishment of 16,000 ha of new woodlands; and (iii) Biomass Strategy (BS), involving conversion of 65,513 ha of arable land into bioenergy crops. It was assumed that each of these targets would be implemented by the year 2020, with carbon build-up times of 100, 100 and 30 years, respectively. Estimates of C-stock changes were produced by compiling vegetation and soil organic C-density data for 11 land-use types from a systematic literature review. Results indicated that FS would lead to the highest yearly potential carbon sequestration (up to 3.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). However, the total C-stocks would be the highest under RB (up to 20% increase), owing to the greater area of pastures and arable land being converted into broadleaved forest when compared to FS. BS would have the least effect on C (C-stock increase of up to 0.3% and up to 0.41 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) sequestered). The spatially explicit analytical approach adopted here provides an indication of which land-use changes would contribute most to C-sequestration within the South West region, and could contribute to achieving national emission reduction targets post-2012.

AB  - Wetland soils of the freshwater coastal deltaic regions of Louisiana have developed under decreasing influence from the Mississippi River, which has resulted in lower available nutrient conditions and sediment input relative to other coastal marshes. A laboratory soil respiration experiment was conducted to measure cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production in soils from a floating freshwater marsh in response to additions of added ammonium (N), phosphate (P), ammonium (N) + phosphate (P), and sulfate (S). CO2 respiration was significantly greater over a 28-day period than controls following ammonium N, phosphorus, and sulfate addition at 10 mg L-1. Nitrogen and phosphorus addition at 10 mg L-1 also increased methane production. The lower sulfate amendment (10 mg L-1) did not significantly increase CH4 production. In contrast, the greatest sulfate treatment (100 m L-1) significantly reduced total carbon (C) production by inhibiting CH4 production. The fact that soil C/N (20.2) and C/P (355) ratios were both relatively low may partially explain why both N and P colimited microbial activity and respiration. While microbial activity of freshwater floating marsh soils was stimulated over the short term with increased ammonium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfate exposure, it is unclear whether the increase would be the same over extended periods or would increase in plant productivity from nutrient additions compensate for any loss in soil carbon.

AB  - Salt marshes are important natural carbon sinks with a large capacity to absorb exogenous nutrient inputs. The effects of nutrients on biogeographic productivity patterns, however, have been poorly explored in salt marshes. We conducted field surveys to examine how complex environments affect productivity of two common salt marsh plants, invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis, along an 18,000-km latitudinal gradient on the Chinese coastline. We harvested peak aboveground biomass as a proxy for productivity, and measured leaf functional traits (e.g., leaf area, specific leaf area [SLA], leaf nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]), soil nutrients (dissolved inorganic N [DIN] and available P [AP]), and salinity. We compiled data on mean annual temperature (MAT) and exogenous nutrients (both N and P). Then, we examined how these abiotic factors affect salt marsh productivity using both linear mixed effect models and structural equation modeling. Using a trait-based approach, we also examined how salt marsh productivity responds to changing environments across latitude. Exogenous nutrients (both N and P), compared with temperature and other variables (e.g., DIN, AP, salinity), were the dominant factors in explaining the biogeographic productivity patterns of both S. alterniflora and P. australis. Leaf size-related traits (e.g., leaf area), rather than leaf economic traits (e.g., SLA, leaf N and P), can be used to indicate the positive effects of exogenous nutrients on the productivity of these two species. Our results demonstrated that human eutrophication surpassed temperature as the major driver of biogeographic salt marsh productivity pattern, challenging current models in which biogeographic productivity pattern is primarily controlled by temperature. Our findings have potential broad implications for the management of S. alterniflora, which is a global invader, as it has benefited from coastal eutrophication. Furthermore, exogenous nutrient availability and leaf size need to be integrated into earth system models that are used to predict global plant productivity in salt marshes.

AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes sequester significant quantities of carbon and arc suffering from anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enhancement. However, the effects of this N loading on carbon gas emissions from freshwater-oligohaline tidal marshes are unknown. In this paper, we report on our evaluation of the effects of a N gradient (0, 24, 48 and 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2) y(-1)) on the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. On an annual scale, the oligohaline marsh has significantly higher CO2 emissions, while it has slightly lower CH4 emissions relative to freshwater marsh. The addition of N increased CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh and decreased CH4 emission from the oligohaline marsh, although there was no statistically significant difference in CH4 emission between either of the two marshes and the control. The addition of 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2 )y(-1) significantly increased CO2 emission from the freshwater marsh, while it did not significantly influence CO2 emission from the oligohaline marsh. CH4 and CO2 emission levels were positively correlated with soil temperature under all conditions. The CH4 flux resulting from both the control and the addition of N was negatively correlated with porewater SO42- and Cl- concentrations and soil EC in the oligohaline marsh. Overall, N addition significantly increased carbon gas emissions under freshwater conditions while slightly inhibiting carbon gas emissions from the oligohaline marsh. Our findings suggested that even under low salinity conditions, the effects of N loading on CH4 and CO2 emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes can vary. We propose that the addition of N to estuarine tidal marshes has a significant effect on the carbon cycle and promotes soil carbon loss, phenomena which may be influenced by salinity.

AB  - Ecological restoration of salt marshes using plantations may enhance the macroinvertebrate community, but little is known about the development of benthic macroinvertebrates after ecological engineering projects in European salt marshes. This study analyzed the environment and the macroinvertebrate community in European salt marshes 3 years after restoration using Spartina maritima plantations in comparison with non-restored and preserved marshes in Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). We hypothesized that planting Spartina maritima on intertidal mudflats would increase species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the benthic macroinvertebrate community by increasing environmental heterogeneity, providing feeding resources and improving sediments characteristics. Benthic macrofauna samples (composed mainly of annelids, crustaceans, and mollusks) were sampled in plots of 20 cm x 25 cm to 5 cm depth between +1.8 and +3.0 m above Spanish Hydrographic Zero. Sediment organic matter content, bulk density, pH, and redox potential were the variables that best explained macroinvertebrate distribution. Restored marshes achieved similar diversity and even higher specific richness than preserved marshes, although with differences in species composition. Non-restored marshes showed the lowest diversity. Restored and preserved marshes did not differ in total abundance or biomass of macroinvertebrates, both being higher than in non-restored marshes. The macroinvertebrate communities in preserved and non-restored marshes showed the largest difference in taxa composition, with restored marshes occupying an intermediate position. Salt marsh restoration using S. maritima increased the complexity (ecological diversity and species richness) and abundance of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Our study offers new information about the role of salt marsh plants in mediating faunal communities via ecological engineering projects.

AB  - Ecotone dynamics and shifting range limits can be used to advance our understanding of the ecological implications of future range expansions in response to climate change. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone is an area where range limits and ecotone dynamics can be studied in tandem as recent decreases in winter temperature extremes have allowed for mangrove expansion at the expense of salt marsh. In this study, we assessed aboveground and belowground plant-soil dynamics across the salt marsh-mangrove ecotone quantifying micro-spatial patterns in horizontal extent. Specifically, we studied vegetation and rooting dynamics of large and small trees, the impact of salt marshes (e.g. species and structure) on mangroves, and the influence of vegetation on soil properties along transects from underneath the mangrove canopy into the surrounding salt marsh. Vegetation and rooting dynamics differed in horizontal reach, and there was a positive relationship between mangrove tree height and rooting extent. We found that the horizontal expansion of mangrove roots into salt marsh extended up to eight meters beyond the aboveground boundary. Variation in vegetation structure and local hydrology appear to control mangrove seedling dynamics. Finally, soil carbon density and organic matter did not differ within locations across the salt marsh-mangrove interface. By studying aboveground and belowground variation across the ecotone, we can better predict the ecological effects of continued range expansion in response to climate change.

AB  - Twelve salt marshes in south Louisiana (USA) were classified as either 'impaired' or 'healthy' before a summer sample collection of above- and below-ground biomass and determination of sediment accretion rates. The above-ground biomass of plant tissues was the same at both impaired and healthy salt marshes and was not a good predictor of marsh health. However, below-ground root biomass in the upper 30 cm was much lower in the impaired marshes compared to the healthy marshes. Compromises to root production apparently occur before there is an obvious consequence to the above-ground biomass, which may quickly collapse before remedial action can be taken. The subsequent change in vertical position of the marsh surface may be equivalent to many years of accretion, and be irreversible within decades without considerable effort. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the plant's below-ground accumulation of organic matter, not inorganic matter that governs the maintenance of salt marsh ecosystem in the vertical plane. Reversing the precursor conditions leading to marsh stress before the collapse of the above-ground biomass occurs is therefore a prudent management objective and could be easier than restoration.

AB  - We compared the use of delta C-13 values and C:N ratios from salt-marsh sediments to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL) with an established approach using foraminifera. Analysis of bulk-organic sediment and plant samples collected along transects at two sites in North Carolina, USA demonstrates that sediment delta C-13 values can be used to distinguish between Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh (C photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -17.6 parts per thousand to 16.1 parts per thousand) and Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh (C-3 photosynthetic pathway, delta C-13 values from -28.2 parts per thousand to -21.8 parts per thousand) environments. Juncus roemerianus plants undergo little decompositional change in delta C-13 (average 0.8 parts per thousand), although there is a clear difference between Spartina alterniflora tissue and bulk-organic sediments (approximately 4 parts per thousand). C:N ratios on bulk-organic sediment from freshwater upland and salt-marsh environments converge during early diagenesis, rendering them of little use in reconstructing RSL. The utility of delta C-13 values as a sea-level indicator is limited by the elevational range of C-4 plants, making it difficult to recognize salt-marsh subenvironments and improve the precision of RSL reconstructions. Furthermore, Juncus roemerianus-dominated high marsh and freshwater upland sediments cannot be adequately distinguished with delta C-13 values.

AB  - From 1990 to 2004, we carried out a study on accretionary dynamics and wetland loss in salt marshes surrounding two small ponds in the Mississippi delta; Old Oyster Bayou (OB), a sediment-rich area near the mouth of the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Chitigue (BC), a sediment-poor area about 70 km to the east. The OB site was stable, while most of the marsh at BC disappeared within a few years. Measurements were made of short-term sedimentation, vertical accretion, change in marsh surface elevation, pond wave activity, and marsh soil characteristics. The OB marsh was about 10 cm higher than BC; the extremes of the elevation range for Spartina alterniflora in Louisiana. Vertical accretion and short-term sedimentation were about twice as high at BC than at OB, but the OB marsh captured nearly all sediments deposited, while the BC marsh captured <30%. The OB and BC sites flooded about 15% and 85% of the time, respectively. Marsh loss at BC was not due to wave erosion. The mineral content of deposited sediments was higher at OB. Exposure and desiccation of the marsh surface at OB increased the efficiency that deposited sediments were incorporated into the marsh soil, and displaced the marsh surface upward by biological processes like root growth, while also reducing shallow compaction. Once vegetation dies, there is a loss of soil volume clue to loss of root turgor and oxidation of root organic matter, which leads to elevation collapse. Revegetation cannot occur because of the low elevation and weak soil strength. The changes in elevation at both marsh sites are punctuated, occurring in steps that can either increase or decrease elevation. When a marsh is low as at BC, a step down can result in an irreversible change. At this point, the option is not restoration but creating a new marsh with massive sediment input either from the river or via dredging. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an increasing concern over how accelerated rates of sea-level rise (SLR) will impact tidal marsh ecosystems. The present study evaluates the potential impacts of SLR on marsh sustainability using the Tidal Marsh Model (TMM) with the addition of a new vegetation algorithm within the SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) framework. This new functionality contributes to an improved understanding of how vegetation affects the mean flow velocity and turbulence, and consequently, the sedimentation processes. Using two SLR scenarios (intermediate and extreme SLR rates), we projected the changes in marsh extent over the next 50 years in two representative marsh systems within a subestuary of Chesapeake Bay. Each study site has marshes associated with different physical settings and anthropogenic components: Carter Creek (developed, high topography) vs. Taskinas Creek (natural, low topography, steep banks). Carter Creek experienced a net marsh loss of 7.3% and 60% in the intermediate and extreme SLR scenario, respectively. In some places, due to the local geomorphic settings, marshes were able to migrate inland and offset part of the total loss, whereas marsh transgression was truncated near development and hardened shoreline structures. In Taskinas Creek, marshes are associated with natural lands with steep upland slopes (inhibitor for marsh transgression due to SLR). Marsh net decline was 23.1% (intermediate SLR scenario), and 89.6% (extreme SLR scenario). Marsh transgression was not substantial in this site, suggesting that marsh loss can be primarily attributed to upland bank conditions which prevented marsh migration with accelerated SLR rates. The enhanced TMM provides the highly-resolved simulations of multi-scale processes needed to inform restoration, strategic planning, and monitoring activities to support marsh sustainability in an evolving system.

AB  - This study investigated the trophic shift of young-of-the-year (YOY) thinlip grey mullet Liza ramada and golden grey mullet Liza aurata during their recruitment in a salt marsh located on the European Atlantic Ocean coast. Stable-isotope signatures (13C and 15N) of the fishes followed a pattern, having enrichments in 13C and 15N with increasing fork length (LF): 13C in fishes<30mm ranged from 19.5 to 15.0 parts per thousand, whereas in fishes>30mm 13C ranged from 15.8 to 12.7 parts per thousand, closer to the level in salt-marsh food resources. Large differences between the 15N values of mugilids and those of food sources (6 center dot 0 parts per thousand on average) showed that YOY are secondary consumers, similar to older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YOY mugilids shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30mm LF. The results highlight the role of European salt marshes as nurseries for juvenile mugilids. (C) 2013 The Authors Journal of Fish Biology (C) 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB  - This paper reports changes in vegetation distribution and species cover in relation to soil factors and hydrology in a semiarid Mediterranean salt marsh adjacent to the Mar Menor saline lagoon. Species cover, soil salinity, and the groundwater level were monitored between 1991 and 1993 and between 2002 and 2004, and total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrates, ammonium and exchangeable phosphorus were measured in the soils in both study periods. In addition, three soil profiles were described in August 1992 and August 2004. The results indicate an elevation of the water table throughout the 13-year period, which was attributable to water flowing from areas with intensive agriculture. Flooding increased and soil salinity dropped in the most saline sites and increased in the least saline ones. The morphology of the soil profiles reflected the increase in flooding periods, clue to the appearance of a greyer matrix in the deeper horizons and a more diffuse pattern of Fe mottles. Following these environmental changes, Sarcocornia fruticosa, Phragmites australis and Juncus maritimus strongly expanded at the wettest sites, which led to the disappearance of the original zonation pattern. The cover of Limonium delicatulum, in turn, decreased with the increase in moisture but increased following the increase in salinity. Changes in soil nutrients were only very evident in the sandy soils of the beach, probably due to the influence of organic debris deposited on the shoreline by the storms and due to the strong increase in the colonisation of this habitat by perennial species. According to the results obtained, control measures are needed in order to preserve habitat diversity in this and other salt marshes of this area. Monitoring of the vegetation distribution could be a useful tool to identify environmental impacts, in order to implement remedial actions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses, mitigate climate change by storing atmospheric carbon. Previous blue carbon research has focused on organic carbon stocks. However, recent studies suggest that lateral inorganic carbon export might be equally important. Lateral export is a long-term carbon sink if carbon is exported as alkalinity (TAlk) produced via sulfate reduction coupled to pyrite formation. This study evaluates drivers of pyrite formation in blue carbon ecosystems, compares pyrite production to TAlk outwelling rates, and estimates global pyrite stocks in mangroves. We quantified pyrite stocks in mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses along a latitudinal gradient on the Australian East Coast, including a mangrove dieback area, and in the Everglades (Florida, USA). Our results indicate that pyrite stocks were driven by a combination of biomass, tidal amplitude, sediment organic carbon, sediment accumulation rates, rainfall, latitude, temperature, and iron availability. Pyrite stocks were three-times higher in mangroves (103 +/- 61 Mg/ha) than in saltmarshes (30 +/- 30 Mg/ha) and seagrasses (32 +/- 1 Mg/ha). Mangrove pyrite stocks were linearly correlated to TAlk export at sites where sulfate reduction was the dominant TAlk producing process. However, pyrite generation could not explain all TAlk outwelling. We present the first global model estimating pyrite stocks in mangroves, giving a first-order estimate of 197 Mg/ha (RMSE = 24 Mg/ha). In mangroves, estimated global TAlk production coupled to pyrite formation (similar to 3 mol/m(2)/y) is equal to similar to 24% of their global carbon burial rate, highlighting the importance of including TAlk export in future blue carbon budgets.

AB  - The movement of salt marshes into uplands and marsh submergence as sea level rises is well documented; however, predicting how coastal marshes will respond to rising sea levels is constrained by a lack of process-based understanding of how various marsh zones adjust to changes in sea level. To assess the way in which salt marsh zones differ in their elevation response to sea-level change, and to evaluate how potential hydrologic drivers influence the response, surface elevation tables, marker horizons, and shallow rod surface elevation tables were installed in a Virginia salt marsh in three zones that differed in elevation and vegetation type. Decadal rates of elevation change, surface accretion, and shallow subsidence or expansion were examined in the context of hydrologic drivers that included local sea-level rise, flooding frequency, hurricane storm surge, and precipitation. Surface elevation increases were fastest in the low-elevation zone, intermediate in the middle-elevation zone, and slowest in the high-elevation zone. These rates are similar to (low and middle marsh) or less than (high marsh) local rates of sea-level rise. Root zone expansion, presumably due to root growth and organic matter accumulation, varied among the three salt marsh zones and accounted for 37%, but probably more, of the increase in marsh surface elevation. We infer that, during marsh transgression, soil-forming processes shift from biogenic (high marsh) to minerogenic (low marsh) in response, either directly or indirectly, to changing hydrologic drivers.

AB  - The organic production related to minerogene salt marsh deposits represents a challenge to all attempts to model the development of these areas, and evaluate their chances of survival under different sea level scenarios. Salt marsh deposits on a typical temperate backbarrier saltmarsh area at the Skallingen barrierspit (Denmark) were investigated for autochthonous or below ground organic production, which was found to have a mean value of 0.14 kg m(-2) y(-1) or about 0.1 mm y(-1). This production is concentrated in the upper approximately 5 cm of the salt marsh. Below this level the organic material decomposes with a decreasing organic content until about 15 cm below the surface. Hereunder the decomposition of organic material seems to stabilize at a very low level. The constant rate of the below ground organic production results in a larger concentration of this type of organic matter in the slowest accreting salt marsh deposits. The root activity is the primary reason for differences in the bulk dry density of salt marsh surface layers, therefore the surface layers of slowly accreting salt marshes have the lowest bulk dry density. During autocompaction, the bulk dry density increases down core. This process is only to a small degree (<10%) directly affected by the space loss due to decomposition of organic matter. The decay of organic matter, however, is most likely indirectly part of the autocompaction process by weakening the internal strength of the root fabric and thus the capability of resistance against compaction from the overburden of depositing sediments.

AB  - Salt marshes serve as zones of intense groundwater mixing and reaction between freshwater uplands and estuaries. This raises the question of whether the impacts of upland development on nutrient and carbon species can be transmitted through salt marshes via groundwater, or whether salt marshes can buffer estuarine waters from coastal development. We sampled groundwater from fifteen tidal creek basins in South Carolina to test for compositional differences associated with development and marsh width. Groundwater samples from near creekbanks and below freshwater uplands were analyzed for salinity, total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon. Analyses revealed significantly higher TDN and TDP concentrations in creekbank samples from developed watersheds, independent of the season. Analyses of upland samples revealed significantly lower DOC concentrations in developed uplands, again independent of season. These results support the hypothesis that development can affect groundwater compositions in coastal groundwater and therefore may affect coastal nutrient and carbon fluxes. However, results also revealed significant linear correlations between marsh width, salinity, and nutrient concentrations in some marshes. These results suggest that salt marshes can act as buffers for development, and specifically suggests that the buffering capacity of salt marshes increases with width. Narrow or trenched salt marshes are far less likely to be effective buffers.

AB  - Coastal marshes are important blue carbon reservoirs, but it is unclear how vegetation shifts associated with tidal restoration and sea level rise alter soil microbial respiration rates and bacterial community composition. Within 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 without tidal restrictions, 10 tidally restored), we sampled three vegetation zones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phragmites australis to estimate microbial respiration rates (SIR, substrate-induced respiration; carbon mineralization), root zone bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and a suite of plant and soil characteristics. Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.

AB  - The contribution of organic and inorganic constituents to recent vertical accretion rates (since 1963/4) was estimated for 141 salt marshes ranging from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. The range of vertical accretion and inorganic accumulation rates were 0.09 to 1.78 cm y(-1), and 0.01 to 0.53 g cm y(-1), respectively. The volume of the accumulated organic and inorganic in all salt marshes averaged 3.8 and 4.9%, respectively, of the total, which is relatively low among soil types. The remaining soil volume is water and air. There was a direct relationship between vertical accretion and organic accumulation that explained 59% of the variation for all samples combined. In contrast, the bulk density is strongly and directly related to inorganic content, but not the vertical accretion rate. A multiple regression equation describing the vertical accumulation as a function of mineral and organic accumulation suggests that organic accumulation is five times more important than inorganic accumulation for East coast salt marshes (n = 19; weight basis), but that inorganic content is a statistically-insignificant factor for Gulf of Mexico salt marshes (n = 122), or for all salt marshes examined (n = 141). A simple linear regression showed that a 1 cm rise in salt marsh elevation was composed of 10.9 g of organic matter. A threshold level of 0.02 g organic matter y(-1) accumulation can continue without inorganic accumulation. It appears that it is the accumulation of organic matter that controls inorganic accumulation in established marshes, not the reverse. These results document the dominant role of below ground plant material in maintaining salt marshes once they are established. When wetland hydrology is altered, it is the organic soil constituents that are affected (through oxidation or plant growth below ground), thus explaining salt marsh conversion to open water through indirect changes in hydrology. Salt marsh management and restoration efforts would do well to keep in mind the plant's health, especially belowground, if the long-term and effective strategies are to be successfully implemented. The biological components, not the geological components, appear to control the fate of established salt marshes.

AB  - Coastal marshes contribute greatly to atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) and have thus attracted considerable attention at regional and global scales. However, the relative importance of climates and soil variables to the geographical variation of GHG emissions at a large geographical scale remains poorly understood. We thus investigated the spatial patterns of GHG (CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions from coastal marshes along a latitudinal gradient in China and identified the climatic and soil variables controlling the emissions. Emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O were estimated at rates of 12.8-310 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), 23.6-986 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.58-110 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 increased from high to low latitudes and were strongly correlated with climatic temperature. These emissions also varied significantly between temperate and subtropical climates and between winter and summer. Soil Eh, total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance were the key regulators of CH4 emissions. Soil Eh, TOC, DOC, MBC and MBN were the crucial variables controlling N2O emissions. CO2 emissions across the coastal marshes were controlled mainly by soil pH, TOC, DOC, MBC, MBN and bacterial abundance. Although GHG emissions were strongly correlated with climatic temperature, 28-67% of the variations in GHG emissions were attributed to soil variables. The relative amplitudes (%) of the increases in GHG emissions, estimated on the basis of projected annual increases of 2 or 4 degrees C by 2100, were larger in temperate than subtropical coastal marshes, indicating that the coastal marshes with lower temperature were more sensitive to global warming. The annual emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O estimated from the Chinese coastal marshes accounted for 6.6, 0.62 and 0.70% of the annual emissions from global terrestrial ecosystems, respectively. These results suggest that coastal marshes will be important to future global warming and will play a critical role in global GHG emissions.

AB  - Salt marshes are increasingly recognized as resilient and sustainable supplements to traditional engineering structures for protecting coasts against flooding. Nevertheless, many salt marshes face severe erosion. There is a consensus that providing structures that create sheltered conditions from high energetic conditions can improve the potential for salt marsh growth. However, little proof is provided on the explicit influence of structures to promote salt marsh growth. This paper investigates how artificial structures can be used to steer the morphological development of salt marshes. A morphological model (Delft3D Flexible Mesh) was applied, which enabled the analysis of various artificial structures with realistic representation. A salt marsh in the Wadden Sea which has seen heavy erosion (lateral retreat rate of 0.9 m/year) served as case study. We simulate both daily and storm conditions. Hereby, vegetation is represented by an increased bed roughness. The model is able to simulate the governing processes of salt marsh development. Results show that, without artificial structures, erosion of the salt marsh and tidal flat continues. With structures implemented, results indicate that there is potential for salt marsh growth in the study area. Moreover, traditional structures, which were widely implemented in the past, proved to be most effective to stimulate marsh growth. More broadly, the paper indicates how morphological development of a salt marsh can be steered by various configurations of artificial structures.

AB  - The proportional allocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon to the root and shoot system of salt marsh plants is an important element in the carbon cycle of tidal salt marshes. The commonly applied field methods giving insight on this point are based on successive harvesting of biomass. These methods, however, lack accuracy and do not yield reliable data over short time intervals. In the present study, the stable carbon isotope C-13 was used as a tracer of carbon flow in Spartina anglica. Shoot clusters of this halophyte were incubated with (CO2)-C-13 (ca 1 h) in a salt marsh in the SW Netherlands. Four days after the incubations, shoots and roots/rhizomes were sampled to determine enrichment with the heavy isotope. Although S. anglica is a clonal plant, only a minor part of the excess C-13 incorporated in plant tissues due to the incubation procedure was found outside the incubation plots. The data revealed the dynamic nature of carbon allocation in S. anglica, leading to seasonal changes in the ratio of carbon allocated to above-ground versus below-ground tissues. The ratio was highest in August (6.19) and lowest in September (1.60), but more carbon was always invested in above-ground plant parts than in below-ground plant parts. These findings strongly suggest that, on an annual basis, above-ground biomass production outweighs below-ground biomass production in this S. anglica population. Root/rhizome production over short-term periods (10 to 12 d) was calculated by combining the data on the ratios of C-13 allocation with measurements of above-ground biomass increments over these periods. On an annual basis, above-ground and below-ground biomass production was estimated to be 1130 and 556 g dry wt m(-2), respectively. A survey of the Literature shows that the ratio of shoot to root/rhizome production of Spartina spp. vegetation is highly variable, ranging from a clear dominance of shoot production (as is suggested by our data) to the completely opposite situation with root/rhizome production amply exceeding shoot production. This may imply considerable differences in the functioning of Spartina-dominated marsh systems, e.g. with respect to the dominance of aerobic or anaerobic mineralization processes and to mineralization-linked cycling of sulphur and nitrogen.

AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and bury more C per square meter annually than any other ecosystem. Reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Carbon credits can be generated and sold by restoring marshes, but only if C sequestration and net reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG) are reliably quantified. Restored marshes, however, may exhibit different patterns of GHG emissions than natural marshes and it is possible that they could temporarily become sources of N2O even in the usually N-limited estuarine environment. Research on short-term GHG flux following salt marsh restoration is limited to studies of two restored marshes which examined GHG flux more than six months after the return of tidal flooding. Here we report on a laboratory experiment in which soil cores collected from a drained agricultural marsh on the St. Lawrence Estuary were flooded with estuary water. Gas flux measurements immediately after flooding revealed small increases in N2O and CH4, but a large decline in CO(2 )yielding, from a climatic perspective, a net cooling effect over the observation period. In addition to restoring the land's capacity to sequester C once a marsh develops, returning tidal flooding thus appears to have the added benefit of stemming large ongoing C losses. With more than 400 km(2) of undeveloped dykeland, Eastern Canada is well positioned to restore large sections of marsh and contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

AB  - Among the 90 fishspecies censused in the Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France), 23 colonise and forage in the salt marshes during flood. Therefore, this environment may play an important trophic and nursery role for these species. This community is largely dominated by mullets (81% of the biomass), Liza ramada and secondarily L. aurata. But gobies (mainly Pomatoschistus minutus and P. lozanoi) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) are also present; they represent respectively 11% and 4% of the biomass. During the tide cycles, mullets export from salt marshes about 7% of their body weight (FW) containing a mixture of sediment (43%), organic matter (24%) and water (33%). Gobies and sea bass mainly feed on dwelling macro-invertebrates, and they export respectively 4.5% and 10% of their body weight during a tide cycle. Thus, we estimated that 50 tonnes year(-1) of particulate organic matter (dry weight POM) are exported from the 4000 ha of salt marshes to the marine coastal waters. These fish communities appear to be POM transporters and could play a significant role in the global energy budgets of coastal environments such as Mont Saint-Michel Bay. According to the seasons and the years, the energy exported by fish communities is assumed to range between 0 and 10% of the total POM output.

AB  - Allochthonous input provides important food and spatial resources for estuarine benthic fauna. While it is known that autochthonous materials are important for fauna occupying small marshes, here, we present the significance of allochthonous materials for benthic fauna inhabiting a large salt marsh. To assess the effects of allochthonous input on benthic macrofaunal communities in estuarine salt marshes, we determined the source of substrate sediments and food resource utilisation patterns of benthic invertebrates in 2 temperate estuaries (the Tama River and the Obitsu River estuarine outlets into Tokyo Bay) by using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses. In the Tama River estuary, which has small patches of marsh vegetation upstream of the river mouth, there was an input of sedimentary organic matter from autochthonous sources (i.e. common reed and microphytobenthos). In the Obitsu River estuary salt marsh, which is situated immediately upstream of the river mouth and is well connected to the sea, sediment consists of allochthonous sources (i.e. imported phytoplankton), along with microphytobenthos. Isotope analysis indicated that most benthic invertebrates in the Tama River estuary depend on benthic microalgae (autochthonous) as a food resource, whereas the macrofauna in the Obitsu River estuary are supported by drift macroalgae (allochthonous), in addition to microphytobenthos or phytoplankton. Our results indicated that allochthonous material provides a food resource and potential habitat for benthic macrofauna in extensive salt marshes that have a strong connection to the sea but is not substantial in smaller marshes with limited connectivity to coastal water.

AB  - Total concentrations of selected metals and metalloids; As, Ca, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn were determined in the sediments of five salt marsh sites along the Essex coast of the UK. A fairly ubiquitous degree of metal and metalloid contamination was found within the sediments of all the salt marshes investigated. The extent of contamination by individual metal species was dependent upon the nature of the site-specific inputs. The enrichment of industrially derived metals, such as Hg and Cd, for example, occurred at sites adjacent to urban areas; Two Tree Island (situated on the outer Thames Estuary) and to a lesser extent South Woodham Ferrers (situated on the River Crouch). Lead concentrations were elevated at all five sites inferring that a significant input was derived from a common generic source, such as atmospheric deposition. The distribution of metals and metalloids within individual salt marsh sites was dependent upon a number of factors including sediment type, the hydrological regime, the presence of vegetation, redox potential and organic matter content.

AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands are perceived to provide nutrient dissipation services and serve as the final buffer between excess nutrient loads coming from nearby upland watersheds and sensitive estuarine waters. The construction and restoration of tidal marshes has the potential to benefit coastal waters. However, the water quality services of tidal wetlands have yet to be established with any certainty. This is in part due to the difficulty of monitoring these systems where flow and concentrations vary widely with tidal ebb and flood along with rainfall events mobilizing nutrients in pulses from upstream watersheds. In this article, we show over a period of 10 days following a rainfall event, the value of high temporal resolution data to characterize the complex nutrient and flow dynamics and to reliably calculate material balances in a created coastal marsh in North Carolina. Ultraviolet-visible spectrometers were used to obtain 15-min concentration data for nitrate, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, total suspended solids, phosphate, and total phosphorus. Our results show that a pulse of nitrate moved through the marsh from upstream agricultural production following the rainfall event and 25% (13 kg of 53 kg) of the nitrate was retained in the marsh over a period of 10 days. No other material showed a clear pulse from the upstream agricultural production. The marsh acted as a sink for total suspended solids (40 kg) and had near neutral mass balances for dissolved organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, and phosphate. Subsequent simulations indicated that different and erroneous results would have been obtained from 2, 6- or 12-h sampling intervals. These results demonstrate, even on a short term basis, why high-frequency data acquisition is necessary in these tidal marsh systems to truly quantify their impact on water quality ecosystem services.

AB  - Salt marshes are valued as important greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks, but global changes in climate, nitrogen (N) pollution, and exotic species invasion may alter this marsh function. With the goal of better understanding the potential responses of coastal marsh GHG fluxes to interacting global changes, a multifactorial experiment was conducted. Two climate treatments (present-day and end-of-century temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations) and two N treatments (non-enriched and simulated eutrophic estuary conditions) were applied to mesocosms containing either invasive Phragmites australis (Cav. Trin. Ex Steud.) or native Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl. vegetated soil cores. Fluxes of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in each mesocosm before and after treatment using cavity ring-down spectrometry, along with vegetation growth, edaphic conditions, and pore water chemistry. Methane emissions increased in P. australis but not in S. patens mesocosms under climate change conditions, while CO2 fluxes were similar between vegetation types and treatments. Nitrous oxide emissions increased with N loading from both S. patens and P. australis mesocosms, but were decreased in N-enriched S. patens mesocosms under climate change conditions. These findings demonstrate complex GHG flux responses to global change and suggest the potential for vegetation community-specific responses, though further research is needed to test mechanisms underlying observed GHG flux patterns.

AB  - Habitat functions of a constructed tidal marsh and two adjacent natural tidal marshes were compared between marshes and with similar data collected in the same marshes 7 years earlier. The marshes were sampled for fish. blue crabs, benthic infauna, vegetation community type, stem density and cover, salinity, temperature. dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, and bird utilization. The constructed marsh has progressed to a general level of function similar to that of nearby natural marshes. Some morphological differences remain, such as the differences in community type ratios. Significant differences in habitat function remain in three areas: sediment organic carbon at depth, mature saltbush density. and bird utilization (related to saltbush density), The addition of organic soil amendments and mature saltbush in the construction of tidal marshes will help in the progression of constructed marshes to functional equivalency with natural marshes. Specific functions can be enhanced for fish utilization (more subtidal habitat) and for birds (more shrub habitat) depending on management priorities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Invasion of coastal marshes by Phragmites australis may alter carbon cycling, including fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Understanding patterns and drivers of these GHG fluxes in P. australis-invaded coastal marshes is critical to predicting how this widespread biological invasion may impact carbon (C) sequestration in coastal marshes. The objectives of this study were (1) to test effects of P. australis aboveground vegetation removal on GHG fluxes over short timescales (up to 4 months) and (2) to contrast diel patterns of GHG fluxes in P. australis-vegetated and cleared plots. First, effects of mechanical aboveground P. australis biomass removal on GHG fluxes and soil variables were tested over a series of short-term durations (from min to months). Next, on 3 dates, GHG fluxes were measured every 3 h over complete diel cycles. Net daytime CO2 uptake (-60 to 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was observed where P. australis was left intact. All durations of vegetation removal produced similar CO2 emissions to those measured from intact P. australis plots during evening hours. CH4 fluxes did not differ where P. australis was removed or left intact. Greater daytime CH4 emissions (75-100 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were found than at night (20-40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) from both cleared and vegetated plots. Results of this study suggest that CO2 fluxes in this system vary primarily due to substantial photosynthetic uptake by P. australis, and that CH4 emissions are likely driven by abiotic factors, such as temperature, that vary on diel cycles. Calculation of net GHG fluxes in this P. australis-invaded coastal marsh indicates that it is a GHG sink during the growing season. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tropical marsh ecosystems play a key role in global carbon cycle. Mineralization of organic matter mediated by enzymes in such systems is of great importance in the cycle but little is known about it. This study assessed a suite of enzyme activities in two- depths of marsh soils with different water regime. Overall, enzyme activities were lower in drier soils than wet soils, suggesting water content would be a key controlling variable for decomposition in the system. Unlike northern peatland, decomposition rates may be lowered by frequent drought that is expected in the future climate.

AB  - The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico had significant effects on microbial communities in the Gulf, but impacts on nitrifying communities in adjacent salt marshes have not been investigated. We studied persistent effects of oil on ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities and their relationship to nitrification rates and soil properties in Louisiana marshes impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Soils were collected at oiled and unoiled sites from Louisiana coastal marshes in July 2012, 2 years after the spill, and analyzed for community differences based on ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA). Terminal Restriction Fragment Polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses revealed significantly different AOA and AOB communities between the three regions, but few differences were found between oiled and unoiled sites. Community composition of nitrifiers was best explained by differences in soil moisture and nitrogen content. Despite the lack of significant oil effects on overall community composition, we identified differences in correlations of individual populations with potential nitrification rates between oiled and unoiled sites that help explain previously published correlation patterns. Our results suggest that exposure to oil, even 2 years post-spill, led to subtle changes in population dynamics. How, or if, these changes may impact ecosystem function in the marshes, however, remains uncertain.

AB  - The tide plays a crucial role in maintaining the carbon sink strength in salt marsh ecosystems. Furthermore, the effects of tides on ecosystem carbon exchange could vary with different timescales. Using the eddy covariance technique combined with wavelet analysis, we analyzed the time-frequency characteristics of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) to address the tidal effects on NEE at multiple timescales. The wavelet analysis showed that NEE displayed a tidal-driven pattern with distinct characteristics at the multiday scale (i.e., 8-16 days) and the seasonal scale (i.e., 64-128 days). Moreover, a more significant controlling effect of light rather than air temperature on NEE was found at the diel scale. Tides also affected the variation of the diurnal pattern of NEE. Tidal flooding inhibited nighttime CO2 emissions (NEEnighttime) as well as decreased temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NEEnighttime from 1.37 to 1.16. In contrast, the response of daytime NEE (NEEdaytime) to tidal activities was more complicated, as the NEEdaytime reacted differently with different months during the growing season. Overall, our findings can contribute to a better understanding of tidal effects on ecosystem carbon exchange in salt marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes were often installed in the proximity of cities and industrialized areas. In these cases, flooding transports large quantities of contaminants in both dissolved and suspended particulate forms to the salt marsh areas. Anthropogenic metals are incorporated in the sediments, decreasing their availability in the water column. Vascular plants in salt marshes are determinant to the dynamics of the estuarine ecosystem and strongly influence the processes of accumulation and retention of heavy metals in these areas. The utilization of wetlands as filters has gained great interest in the past decades. However, the role that plants play in the filter function of wetlands in relation to metals is still a matter of investigation.
   When the metal contaminants enter in the salt marsh they spread along with the tides and periodic floods and interact with soil and the biotic community. Salt marsh plants are known to accumulate large amounts of metals in their aerial and belowground organs but also for their ability to phytostabilize these contaminants in the rhizosediment, playing an important role in the this ecosystem autoremediative processes and biogeochemistry.
   When we consider the possible toxic effects of metals to the marsh ecosystem and also to human health, the total amount of metal is not as important as the chemical form that is present, responsible for the bioavailability to the plant uptake and consequently to the introduction in the food web. Activity of plant roots and associated microbes can alter physical and chemical properties of the sediment, influencing geochemical fractionation of metals and thus availability to the plant. Organic matter pools are known to be highly efficient sinks of heavy metals, constituting an important fraction of metal species, present in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter cycles are supported by microbial enzymatic degradation mechanisms and consequently affect the organic bound metals. Along with this, microbial driven sulphidisation is also an important factor when considering speciation processes. Without ignoring physic-chemical factors, as pH, Eh and oxygen profiles, microbial speciation processes assume a very important role, unconsidered in most studies.
   In this chapter it will be discussed the influence of vascular plants and microbial activity in salt marsh sediments and its consequences in metal chemical speciation.

AB  - Estuarine ecosystems, including tidal marsh creek systems, are hotspots of carbon cycling. Despite their biogeochemical importance, the magnitude and timescales at which carbon concentrations vary in these environments remain poorly characterized. To address this, our study identified temporal patterns in carbon pools in a tidal marsh creek with the goal of identifying their primary drivers. Specifically, we measured concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC, DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), water quality parameters, and organic matter source proxies (delta C-13, delta N-15, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)). We collected samples every 2.5 h over a tidal cycle monthly (October 2013-January 2015, intermittently thereafter). We characterized organic matter composition from marsh and estuarine endmembers using samples collected at low and high tides respectively. POC concentrations were highest at high tide (4.21 +/- 0.40 mg/L), whereas DIC concentrations were highest at low tide (24.82 +/- 0.74 mg/L), suggesting that the marsh was a sink for POC and source of DIC. Temporally, DIC concentrations were highest in fall (23.19 +/- 1.30 mg/L); DOC and POC varied little across seasons. We used linear mixed effect models to identify potential processes that explained these temporal patterns. Suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were the best predictors of POC concentrations, while CDOM was the best predictor of DOC, and percent freshwater was the best predictor of DIC (p < 0.001). Results from this study highlight the importance of measuring multiple carbon pools simultaneously, as each pool is influenced by different sources and processes and responds differently to drivers that change at tidal and seasonal timescales.

AB  - Background and aims Although the role of microbial iron respiration in tidal marshes has been recognized for decades, the effect of rhizosphere processes on dissimilatory ferric iron reduction (FeR) is poorly known. Herein, we examined the FeR surrounding the root zone of three tidal marsh plants.
   Methods Using in situ rhizoboxes, we accurately separated rhizobox soil as one rhizosphere zone, and three bulk soil zones. Dissimilatory and sulfidic-mediated FeR were quantified by accumulation of non-sulfidic Fe(II) and Fe sulfides over time, respectively.
   Results The rates of dissimilatory FeR attained 42.5 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) in the rhizosphere, and logarithmically declined by up to 19.1 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) in the outer bulk soil. The rates of sulfidic-mediated FeR were less than 2 mu mol Fe g(-1) d(-1) among all zones. Poorly crystalline Fe(III), DOC and DON, porewater Fe2+, and SO42- were all enriched in the rhizosphere, whereas non-sulfidic Fe(II) and Fe sulfides gradually accumulated away from the roots. Iron reducers (Geobacter, Bacillus, Shewanella, and Clostridium) had higher populations in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Higher rates of dissimilatory FeR were observed in the Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora rhizoboxes than in the Cyperus malaccensis rhizoboxes.
   Conclusions The radial change pattern of dissimilatory FeR rates were determined by allocation of poorly crystalline Fe(III) and dissolved organic carbon. The interspecies difference of rhizosphere dissimilatory FeR was associated with the root porosity and aerenchyma of the tidal marsh plants.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of salt marsh geomorphology on the distribution of surface metal content. Surface sediment samples (46) were taken along two transects across an intertidal salt marsh island. Abundance of Ca, Al, Fe, Ni, Cr, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, As, and Zr vary up to 300 % with statistically significant differences along transects and between transects. Along transect, metal abundances are strongly influenced by elevation and distance from the subtidal channel. Between transects, salt marsh morphodynamics, relative marsh age, and water sources seem to affect metal distribution. These observations lead us to hypothesize that at least three scales of variability can be expected for assessing salt marsh sediment metal distributions. Larger-scale variations associated with salt marsh sediment sources and age, and another related to local salt marsh geomorphic structure. Therefore, studies that characterize salt marsh metal loading should explicitly consider the variability imposed over a range of spatial scales.

AB  - Juveniles and adults (> 100 mm) of Liza ramada colonize macrotidal salt marsh creeks of Mont Saint-Michel bay (France) between March and November, during spring tide floods (43% of the tides) and return to coastal waters during the ebb. This fish species actively feeds during its short stay in the creek (from 1 to 2 h). On average, each fish swallows sediment including living and inert organic matter, which amounts to 8% of its fresh body weight. Their diet is dominated by small benthic items (especially diatoms and salt marsh plant detritus), that correspond to the primary and detritic production of this macrotidal salt marsh creek. Despite very short submersion periods, mullets filter and ingest large quantities of sediment and concentrated organic matter (on average organic matter in stomach content is 31%) produced by these coastal wetlands. European salt marshes are thus shown to act as trophic areas for mullets, which are well adapted to this constraining habitat which is only flooded for short periods during spring tides.

AB  - Salt marshes in two contrasting estuaries of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast, Barnegat Bay and Delaware Bay, were investigated to identify relationships between rates of sedimentation and marsh estuarine geomorphic setting. Barnegat Bay is a microtidal lagoon estuary with back-barrier and mainland coastal marshes, whereas Delaware Bay is a micro-mesotidal coastal plain estuary with sediment-rich estuarine marshes. Salt marshes of both estuaries are dominated by Spartina alterrallora. An analysis was performed to characterize marsh hypsometry and tidal flooding characteristics, and a coring study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment accumulation, organic matter accumulation, and vertical accretion using Cs-137 and Pb-210 chronology at nine sites in both estuaries. Mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation rates were significantly higher in Delaware Bay marshes (sediment mean and 1 sigma. 2.57 +/- 2.03 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.65 +/- 0.26 kg m(-2) year(-1)) than in Barnegat Bay (sediment: 0.31 +/- 0.27 kg m(-2) year(-1); organic: 0.29 +/- 0.08 kg m(-2) year(-1)), as were rates of accretion (Delaware Bay: 0.79 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1); Barnegat Bay: 0.28 +/- 0.06 cm year(-1)). Regression analysis indicated that marsh accretion rates were positively correlated with rates of sediment and organic accumulation, but the upper limit of accretion was governed by sediment accumulation. Tidal flooding frequency and duration did not correlate with marsh accumulation or accretion rates in either estuary, suggesting that hydroperiod is subordinate to sediment availability in governing rates on 50-100 year time scales. If true, natural and (or) human influences on suspended-sediment production and transport in these estuaries has potential to impact marsh accretionary status and stability, independent of sea-level rise.

AB  - Neohelice granulata is a crab found in salt marshes and mangroves of the south and south-eastern Atlantic coast of South America. Reproductive biology was studied by taking samples for two years at two salt marshes-'Prainha' and 'Ilha'-in the estuarine region of Patos Lagoon (southern Brazil). Ovigerous females were found most of the year in both salt marshes with average CW ranging from 18.5 (Prainha) to 22.8 mm (Ilha). A significant linear relationship was found between log(CW) and log(number of eggs). Average size at the onset Of maturation was 14.9 and 14 mm at Prainha, for males and females, respectively, while at Ilha it was 18.2 and 16.8 mm, for males and females, respectively. Results provided evidence of significant differences in reproductive traits between populations of the two salt marshes. Differences are likely related to the higher organic matter content found in the sediment from Ilha.

AB  - Over the history of ecology, well-established generalizations were refined or even changed after the appearance or consideration of new evidence. Here, we review results obtained in Southwestern Atlantic salt marshes (between southern Brazil -32A degrees 1' S- and the Argentinean Patagonia -53A degrees 48' S-). Most of these salt marshes are inhabited by the intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice granulata, a species that influences many ecological processes through bioturbation and herbivory. The experimental evaluation of these processes shows that in some cases, the results were not consistent with generalizations and models of salt marsh ecological functioning. However, this does not imply that the generalizations grounded mainly on the results from North American sites are not valid. In turn, we suggest that these apparently conflicting results emerged because two major processes, herbivory and bioturbation, have been overlooked until recently. Thus, their relative contribution has not been included in the models of salt marsh functioning. In conclusion, we believe that there is a need for performing parallel and simultaneous experiments comparing distant sites with varying environmental (i.e., abiotic and biotic) conditions to be able to uncover common processes and causes of contingencies. Particularly, Southwestern Atlantic salt marshes could lead the way in providing information to better incorporate herbivory and bioturbation into current models or paradigms about how salt marshes work.

AB  - This study developed a conceptual understanding of climate change responses of salt marsh in open and closed estuaries and outlined changes in terms of implications for ecosystem services. Changes in salt marsh cover in South Africa were described in relation to prevailing pressures. Salt marshes occur in the sheltered estuaries distributed along the similar to 3000 km coastline. Supratidal salt marsh occurs at elevation greater than 1.5 m amsl and are dominant in the cool temperate (5328.28 ha) and intertidal salt marsh in the warm temperate region (2093.31 ha). Although small in total extent (14 955 ha), salt marshes play a central role in biodiversity conservation because they provide critical habitat for migratory fish and birds. Approximately 43% of salt marsh habitat has been lost due to encroaching development and agriculture from the 1930s to 2018. In addition, salinisation and desiccation resulting from upstream freshwater abstraction reduces freshwater inflow, which extends periods of mouth closure in temporarily closed estuaries causing inundation and flooding of salt marsh. Predicting the combined effects of multiple stressors (increase in storm surges, floods, droughts and reduced river flow) is critical to conserve these important habitats. Research and monitoring to understand salt marsh responses is ongoing because the interface between the subtropical and warm temperate coastal regions of South Africa is expected to be affected by mangrove range expansion. This study is globally relevant as little is known about southern hemisphere salt marshes in Africa and data are needed for comparative purposes.

AB  - Vegetation patterns in salt marshes are largely based on elevation in relation to tidal flooding. In New England salt marshes, vegetation is distinctly zoned into species that occur in the high marsh (elevations above mean high tide) vs. those that reside in the low marsh (elevations below mean high tide). The extent and distribution of these species is responsive to changes in hydrology, particularly sea level rise. In this study, six salt marshes within Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS) were analyzed using a GIS-based mapping approach that utilized aerial images from 1984 and 2013. The results indicate that there have been highly variable amounts of change among marshes. There have been substantial losses of high marsh vegetation (> 190 acres in total), while low marsh vegetation has exhibited large gains in some marshes and relatively minor losses in others with a total net gain of > 131 acres. Because sea level rise appears to be outpacing vertical accretion, higher water levels in the near future could result in large vegetation shifts, which would translate to significant changes in marsh structure and function.

AB  - Salt marshes store large quantities of carbon in the form of buried organic matter (OM) and consequently play a major role in the global carbon cycle, yet vertical accretion and carbon burial rates (CBRs) can vary by orders of magnitude on small spatial scales. The goal of this study was to provide insight into carbon burial variability of a single tidal salt marsh. Six marsh sediment cores were collected along a tidal creek in the Big Bend of Florida from the mouth to the coastal forest within the marsh levee and plain. Each was analyzed for porosity, % OM, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C-13, N-15, and excess Pb-210 to determine vertical accretion and CBRs. Porosity, % OM, and TOC and TN were found to be highest in the low marsh and within the marsh levee. Stable isotopes of OM indicate the source is dominated by C3 plant species in both the levee and plain. Average vertical accretion ranges from 0.9 mm yr(-1) to 2.2 mm yr(-1) with the slowest rates in the low marsh. Average carbon burial ranges from 49.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1) to 109.5 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). High carbon burial associated with low sediment accumulation in the Low Marsh and low carbon burial associated with high sediment accumulation rates in the High Marsh are typical in this marsh. These variations imply that the highest carbon burial occurs in the zone most vulnerable to loss via inundation and erosion.

AB  - The relationship between methane emissions and salinity is not well understood in tidal marshes, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of marsh conservation and restoration on greenhouse gas balance. We used published and unpublished field data to investigate the relationships between tidal marsh methane emissions, salinity, and porewater concentrations of methane and sulfate, then used these relationships to consider the balance between methane emissions and soil carbon sequestration. Polyhaline tidal marshes (salinity > 18) had significantly lower methane emissions (mean +/- sd = 1 +/- 2 gm(-2) yr(-1)) than other marshes, and can be expected to decrease radiative forcing when created or restored. There was no significant difference in methane emissions from fresh (salinity=0-0.5) and mesohaline (5-18) marshes (42 +/- 76 and 16 +/- 11 gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while oligohaline (0.5-5) marshes had the highest and most variable methane emissions (150 +/- 221 gm(-2) yr(-1)). Annual methane emissions were modeled using a linear fit of salinity against log-transformed methane flux (log(CH4) - -0.056 x salinity + 1: 38; r(2) = 0.52; p < 0.0001). Managers interested in using marshes as greenhouse gas sinks can assume negligible methane emissions in polyhaline systems, but need to estimate or monitor methane emissions in lower-salinity marshes.

AB  - Primary production and the detritus pathway (i.e., detritus production, litter fall, export to coastal waters, and decomposition) were studied over a I-year period in three salt marsh levels (low, middle and high marshes). Carbon and nitrogen content in biomass and macro-detritus were estimated at each step of the detrital pathway. Several lines of evidence suggested that low, middle and high marshes had different properties which affected their interaction with adjoining waters. More than species diversity, the salt marsh zonation across a 1.8 km transect resulted in a spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of organic matter and nutrients within the salt marsh. The low marsh was the less productive level (1080 g dry weight m-(2) per year) and was a source of organic matter for the two other marsh levels. Almost 89% of the organic matter produced in the low marsh was flushed away by the tide and redistributed inside the marsh, whereas the remainder decomposed quickly (0.023 per day) at the production site. The export of macro-detritus to coastal waters was probably insignificant to the carbon and nitrogen balance of the salt marsh. In the middle and high marshes, most of the production fell as litter directly at the production site. In the high marsh, vegetation stands were very productive (1990 g dry weight m(-2) per year) and litter decomposed slowly (0.0047 per day), The middle marsh was as productive as the high marsh (1910 g dry weight m(-2) per day), but the decay rate (0.028 per day) was similar to that estimated for the low marsh. This study demonstrates that the mineralization of halophyte-derived organic matter takes place almost completely within the marsh itself. Data on carbon and nitrogen decay indicated that only a small part of the high marsh production was rapidly available to fuel food webs of the ecosystem or to be exported to coastal waters. In contrast, the high amount of biomass produced in the middle marsh was rapidly available for food webs, Export of organic matter may be controlled by macro-detritus production (amount and timing), intensity and time distribution of tide events, and, mostly, decay rates. Because for most of the year the marsh is exposed to the atmosphere, we suggest that exchanges of gaseous carbon and nitrogen with the atmosphere should be investigated.

AB  - The US southeastern continental shelf, also known as the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), is a strong source of CO, to the atmosphere, which is in direct contrast to recent reports regarding other major continental shelves. Both spatial (cross-shelf) and seasonal variations of the CO2 system were pronounced in the SAB. Sea surface pCO(2) in winter was undersaturated relative to the atmosphere, while oversaturation of pCO(2) dominated the entire shelf water in all other seasons. Annually, the SAB releases CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate of 30g Cm-2 (2.5 mol cm(-2)). This system also discharges dissolved inorganic carbon to the open ocean (30 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Methods of estimating CO2 flux and DIC flux are critically evaluated and compared. A carbon mass balance model in the SAB is presented based on inorganic carbon fluxes from this study and organic carbon fluxes from literature. The carbon budget is much closer to balance by using this carbon flux approach than by direct measurements of primary production and respiration. It is concluded that the SAB is a net heterotrophic system annually. Intensified hearing, elevated input of inorganic carbon from coastal salt marshes, microbial respiration of marsh-exported organic carbon and the lack of annual spring blooms all contribute to maintaining the SAB as a strong CO2 Source to the atmosphere during the warm seasons. In winter, the primary factor that governs the CO2 sink in the SAB is likely the cooling process. Strong heterotrophy during warm seasons also sustains the SAB to be an exporter of inorganic carbon to the open ocean annually. The SAB shelf functions differently from the East China Sea, the North Atlantic European Shelves, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. The SAB is classified as a "marsh-dominated" shelf as compared to other shelves in terms of carbon dynamics. Further work to study carbon dynamics in coastal margins is warranted to interpret their roles in the global CO, budget. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt marshes constitute highly productive systems playing an important role on ecosystem functions. The aim of this study is to compare the role of Spartina maritima salt marshes on carbon cycling. Thus, four salt marshes located in two mesotidal estuarine systems (Tagus and Mondego, two salt marshes per estuary) were studied. The S. maritima above- and belowground biomass, carbon production, decomposition rates (through a litterbag experiment) and carbon content in the sediment were estimated for a one year period in both systems and compared. In Corroios (located at the Tagus estuary) S. maritima salt marsh had the highest belowground production (1008 gC m(-2) y(-1)), slower decomposition rate (k = 0.0024 d(-1)), and the highest carbon content in sediments (750 gC m(-2) y(-1)); and thus, the highest carbon retention capacity. The other three salt marshes had comparatively higher aboveground productions, higher decomposition rates and lower carbon retention capacity. Therefore, Corroios had the most important carbon cycling characteristics. As a whole, results show that differences in carbon cycling in salt marshes depend mostly on its own characteristics and maturity, rather than the system itself. The intrinsic characteristics of the salt marshes, namely the physicochemical conditions determined by the maturity of the system, are more important factors affecting the role of warm-temperate mesotidal salt marshes as carbon sinks.

AB  - The impact of the Deepwater Horizon blowout on salt marshes was investigated by observing the biogeochemistry in salt marsh sediments along the Gulf Coast. High sulfide levels due to hydrocarbon loading, increased microbial activity, and microbial community shifts can lead to plant browning and mortality. Sediment biogeochemical processes that degrade enriched carbon pools through sulfate reduction are primarily responsible for the biodegradation of spilled hydrocarbons. An assessment of the impact of contamination on salt marshes at Skiff Island, LA, and Cat Island, Marsh Point, and Saltpan Island, MS, was achieved through sediment electrode profiling, microbial community profiling, and quantification of hydrocarbon contamination, which captured the spatial sedimentary biogeochemical response that affects salt marsh productivity. At western locations (Skiff and Cat Islands), total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) ranged from 2183 to 2996 mg kg(-1), which was more than double the TPH concentration observed at eastern locales. At eastern study locations (e.g., Marsh Point), sedimentary pore-water H2S concentrations were higher (maximum value = 231 mg L-1) and detected further up in the sediment column than at western locales (e.g., Skiff Island). Similarly, anaerobic and aerobic microbial activity, as measured by C substrate utilization profiles and well-color development, was as high or higher at eastern locations as compared with western locations. These results indicate that other factors besides location or degree of contamination, perhaps sedimentary dynamics and physical processes specific to each marsh, should be considered when determining salt marsh response to hydrocarbon contamination.

AB  - Bacterial. utilization of monomers is recognized as an important step in the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter. In this study we have compared the heterotrophic activity of bacterial. communities from different micro-habitats within a salt marsh environment (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) in order to establish spatial patterns of bacterial. abundance, monomer turnover rates (Tr) and bacterial. growth efficiency (BGE).
   Differences in bacterial. abundance and activity could be found between distinct plant rhizospheres. BGE tended to be lower at Halimione portulacoides banks, when compared to Sarcocornia perennis subsp. perennis banks which, on the contrary, showed the highest bacterial. densities.
   Experiments of amendment of natural samples with organic and inorganic supplements indicated that salt marsh bacteria are not strongly regulated by salinity but the increased availability of labile organic matter causes a significant metabolic shift towards mineralization.

AB  - The degree to which short-duration, transient floods modify wetland-atmosphere exchange of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide (CO2) is poorly documented despite the significance of flooding in many wetlands. This study explored the effects of transient floods on salt marsh-atmosphere linkages. Eddy flux, micrometeorological, and other field data collected during two tidal phases (daytime versus nighttime high tides) quantified the salt marsh radiation budget, surface energy balance, and CO2 flux. Analysis contrasted flooded and nonflooded and day and night effects. The salt marsh surface energy balance was similar to that of a heating-dominated sparse crop during nonflooded periods but similar to that of an evaporative cooling-dominated, well-watered grassy lawn during flooding. Observed increases in latent heat flux and decreases in net ecosystem exchange during flooding were proportional to flood depth and duration, with complete CO2 flux suppression occurring above some flood height less than the canopy height. Flood-induced changes in the salt marsh energy balance were dominated by changes in sensible heat flux, soil heat flux, and surface water heat storage. Parameters suitable for predicting the salt marsh surface energy balance were obtained by calibrating common models (e.g., Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor, and pan coefficient). Biophysical controls on salt marsh-atmosphere exchange were identified following calibration of models describing the coupling of canopy photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in the salt marsh. The effects of flooding on salt marsh-atmosphere exchange are temporary but strongly affect the marsh water, carbon, and energy balance despite their short duration.

AB  - The specific features in the distribution of organic and mineral nitrogen compounds in marsh and tundra soils of the European Russian Arctic (coastal areas of the Barents and White Seas) were analyzed. Total nitrogen was determined by gas chromatography (CHNS-O elemental analyzer), and inorganic nitrogen, by photometry. The composition of hydrolyzable amino acids was analyzed by liquid chromatography on ion exchange resins. Mineral compounds accounted for an insignificant part of the total soil nitrogen; its major part (to 97% of the total content) was represented by organic substances (N-org). The N-org varied within a wide range in both marsh (0.3-15.8 g/kg) and tundra soils (5-20 g/kg in the peat horizons and 0.3-2 g/kg in the mineral horizons). The content of N-NH4+ varied from 5 to 20 mg/kg in marsh soils and from 30 to 200 mg/kg in tundra soils. In marsh soils, the content of nitrate nitrogen was 0.2-4.6 mg/kg in the upper horizons. Marsh soils were characterized by the accumulation of N-org either on the surface or in the middle part of the profile in the presence of humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments. The accumulation of N-org and N-NH4+ was observed above the permafrost in the peat-gley soil and in the permafrost in the oligotrophic peat soil. The content of hydrolyzable amino acids in the soils of different geneses was 0.6-8 g/kg, which corresponded to 30-60% of the soil organic nitrogen and 2-12% of the soil organic carbon. Distribution patterns of the amino acid nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the soil profiles were similar. The qualitative composition of amino compounds was relatively uniform, and the ratios of most of them were close. The shares of arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine were less than 4% each; of lysine, valine, proline, serine, and threonine, 5 to 7%; and of alanine and leucine, 10-12%. The share of glycine increased downward the profile from 12 to 20%, and the shares of aspartic and glutamic acids decreased from 11 to 6%. In marsh soils, N-org, N-NH4+, and nitrogen of most amino acids correlated (r = 0.6-0.9) with the clay content and nonsilicate iron forms. The tightest correlations were observed between the dithionite-soluble iron and the nitrogen of threonine and histidine.

AB  - Killifish are ecologically important components of salt marsh ecosystems, but no studies have determined the importance of locally produced versus allochthonous food sources on a scale of less than multiple kilometers. The goal of our study was to examine diet and movement of the killifish, Fundulus heteroditus, collected from a Maine salt marsh to assess the importance of locatly produced versus allochthonous food sources on a scale of several hundred meters. We compared the gut contents and stable isotope signatures of F. heteroditus from four regions along the central river of a Maine salt marsh to the distinct food sources and isotopic signatures of the region of the marsh in which they were caught. F. heteroditus were relying on locally produced food sources even on the scale of several hundred meters. They fed daily in a small area less than 6 ha and maintained relatively strong site fidelities over the course of several months. Phytoplankton and salt marsh detritus both contributed to the high production of F. heteroclitus, terrestrial plant detritus was not an important component of their diet. The diet and feeding patterns of F. heteroditus from this small Maine salt marsh were similar to the patterns found in much larger salt marshes, suggesting that locally produced organic matter is essential to the production of these ecologically important fish.

AB  - Salt marshes form part of the widely distributed intertidal landscape. The salt marshes of the East Frisian barrier island Langeoog (NW Germany) belong to the barrier-connected salt marsh type and were protected by a summer dike that was removed in 2004. In this study, pore water and sediment data were combined to investigate the effects of the de-embankment along a transect including sites on seawater-influenced grassland, high and low salt marsh, and transition zone tidal flat-low salt marsh. Pore waters were sampled with in situ pore water samplers for 13 mo and analysed for trace metals (Fe, Mn), nutrients (NH4+, PO43-), dissolved organic carbon, and sulphate. Additionally, on site measurements of pH and salinity were carried out. Pore water ultrafiltration experiments with 5000 Da MWCO (molecular weight cut off) complemented the water analyses. Sediment samples were taken from hammer corings and were analysed for bulk parameters (total carbon [TC], total inorganic carbon [TIC], total organic carbon [TOC], total sulphur [TS]) and selected major elements (Si, Al, Fe, Mn). Additionally, reactive iron and manganese were analysed.
   Sediments along the study transect are characterised by quartz dominance and very low TC (TOC and TIC) and TS contents. The iron content is comparable to other salt marsh sediments. The high percentage of reactive iron (up to 40%) indicates that salt marsh sediments form an important iron source for pore waters, as confirmed by high pore water concentrations of dissolved iron (up to 583 mu M). Dissolved iron in pore waters most likely results from reduction and dissolution of oxidised iron minerals by organic ligands or Fe(II) organic complexes. Iron complexation by humic substances and siderophores in combination with circum-neutral pH values keep iron in solution. Therefore, the studied salt marshes presumably form an important iron reservoir, which may account for elevated pyrite contents frequently observed in Holocene coastal peats.
   Flooding of the salt marsh during a storm surge resulted in a considerable increase in pore water iron (8-fold), manganese (21-fold), phosphate (5-fold), and ammonia (7-fold) concentrations. These results show that seawater restoration (de-embankment) should be handled very carefully, especially with regard to nutrient release and subsequent changes in pore water quality.

AB  - The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the impact of rhizosphere/burrow oxidation by wetland plants and burrowing invertebrates on the biogeochemistry of metals and metalloids in salt marsh ecosystems. It was hypothesised that salt marsh plants and burrowing invertebrates could considerably affect the retention capacity of wetlands for metals through oxidation of the rhizosphere/burrow wall.
   Various soil, plant and porewater samples were collected from areas dominated by the plant species Spartina townsendii and Atriplex portulacoides and by the lugworm Arenicola marina, and from corresponding nearby unvegetated/uninhabited sites at North Bull Island salt marsh, Dublin Bay, Ireland. Samples were analysed for total Fe, Zn and As. The organic matter content (LOT), bulk density, water content and dry/fresh weight ratio of rhizosphere, burrow wall and bulk soil was measured for each species. DCB-extractable Fe, Zn and As, associated with the iron plaque on the roots of the two plant species were also determined.
   The presence of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, burrowing organisms were shown to have a significant effect on the concentration and accumulation of heavy metals in salt marsh soils. Iron and arsenic concentrations were significantly higher in vegetated/inhabited sails compared to nearby unvegetated/uninhabited areas. Zinc showed the same trend but the difference was not statistically significant. The concentrations of Fe and As were also significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil around the plant roots and in the burrow walls of Arenicola compared to the bulk soil. For zinc, the same pattern was significant only for S. townsendii-dominated soils. Atriplex stands appeared to have the greatest potential for heavy metal accumulation with concentrations reaching 1238 mu mol Fe g(-1), 4.9 mu mol Zn g(-1) and 512 nmol As g(-1) in the rhizosphere. The Zn/Fe ratio for S. townsendii and the As/Fe ratios for both plant species also increased from the bulk soil towards the roots. Concentrations of Zn and As appeared to correlate with both Fe concentrations and LOI values. However, covariation was significant only with Fe, indicating that it is the oxidation of Fe, rather than the binding to organic matter, that drives the accumulation of Zn and As. The amount of each element present in the various compartments associated with the plants (the sum of the element concentrations in the rhizosphere, ironplaque and roots) in I litre of the top 20 cm of soil, amounted to 0.84% for Fe, 3.6% for Zn and 2.8% for As for S. townsendii, and 12.5% for Fe, 19% for Zn and 18.3% for As for A. portulacoides. Densities of A. marina were never higher than 1 per litre of top sail so the small volume of burrow wall soil would therefore render that pool of negligible size compared to the rhizospheres of plants. It is likely that lugworms affect the movement of metals more importantly through bioturbation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Two of the greatest problems in coastal waters are eutrophicaton and rapid decline in populations of important fish species. Salt marshes are important in combating both these problems. A paradigm for salt marsh function: marshes import inorganic nutrients and export organic nutrients and, as a result, grow fish. As ground and tidal water flow through salt-water wetlands, plants, bacteria and algae produce or transform the organic matter of the food chain that supports fish and shelltish populations. While salt marshes modify the principal plant nutrients, N and P, some of the pathways result in removal of nutrients from biologically active systems. Nitrogen is removed primarily either by being trapped in refractory organic matter that contributes to marsh maintenance through accretion or through loss to the atmosphere (as N(2)) by denitrification. Salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of the United States have changed during the past century; the number of hectares has declined and the nutrient loading per hectare has increased. We examine data on the correlation between fish catch and various marsh features from Long Island, New York in 1880. We review research on the ways salt marshes reduce both the level and rate of eutrophication of coastal waters by intercepting nitrate in discharging groundwater. Finally, we consider how these functions have changed with the decrease in area of salt marshes along the Atlantic coast from Georgia to Maine.

AB  - This study was carried out in three kinds of salt marshes according to the vegetation covers, including Phragmites australis salt marsh (PSM), Suaeda salus salt marsh (SSM) and Tamarix chinensis-Suaeda salus salt marsh (TSSM). We applied allometric function, exponential function and logistic function to model the depth distribution of the SOCv and SOCc for each salt marsh, respectively. The results showed that the exponential function fits the depth distribution of the SOCv more well than other two functions. The SOCc can be fitted very well by all three functions for three salt marsh (Adj. R-2 > 0.99), of which the allometric function was the best one. The mean topsoil concentration factors (TCFs) of three salt marshes were beyond 0.1, which means the SOC enrichment in surface soils due to plant cycling, but TCFs in PSM were significantly higher than those in SSM (P < 0.05). Nearly 30% of SOC was concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. The results of general linear model (GLM) suggested that four soil properties (soil water content, pH, soil salt content and silt+clay) and their interactive effects explained about 80% of the total variation of SOC stock in the top 20 cm soils and the 20-100 cm soil layers.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures, such as diking, construction of dams, and oil spills negatively impact coastal marshes creating growing pressure to preserve and to restore salt marshes due to their critical role in permanently removing nitrate runoff through denitrification as well as other ecosystem services they provide. This study determined denitrification rates across a typical northern Gulf of Mexico salt marsh landscape that included a natural marsh, a tidal creek, and a 21-year-old restored salt marsh. Denitrification capacity, measured with the isotope pairing technique on a membrane inlet mass spectrometer, was comparable across the sites despite significant differences in above and below ground characteristics. Total extractable ammonium concentrations and sediment carbon content were higher at the natural marsh compared to the restored marsh. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were highest at the creek compared to the vegetated sites and lowest at the restored marsh. This suggests that marsh restoration projects reestablish nitrogen removal capacity at rates similar to those in natural systems and can help to significantly reduce nitrogen loads to the coastal ocean.

AB  - The Northeast USA is experiencing severe impacts of a changing climate, including increased winter temperatures and accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). The sediment-poor, organic-rich nature of many Southern New England salt marshes makes them particularly vulnerable to these changes. In order to assess how marsh accretion has changed over time, we returned to Narragansett Bay, RI where salt marsh vertical accretion rates were documented almost 30 years ago. Using radionuclide tracers (Pb-210 and Cs-137), we observe no significant change in overall accretion rates (0.27-0.69 cm year(-1)) compared to historical averages (0.24-0.60 cm year(-1)), but we document a shift in how these marshes maintain elevation. Organic matter now plays a smaller role in contributing to vertical accretion across all study sites, declining by 22 % on average. We attribute this reduction to potentially higher decomposition rates fueled by higher water temperature. Inorganic matter also contributes less to accretion (declining by 44 % on average at marshes located more internal to the estuary), likely due to diminishing sediment supply in this region. With organic and inorganic solids accounting for less of the total accretion, several of the marshes are experiencing symptoms of swelling, with water and porespace contributing more towards accretion compared to historical values. Accretion rates (0.27-0.45 cm year(-1)) at these organic-rich (> 40 % sediment organic matter) marshes are predominantly lower than the current (30 years) rate of RSLR (0.41 +/- 0.07 cm year(-1)). These results, combined with the increased rate of RSLR and the hardened shorelines inhibiting landward migration, call into question the long-term survivability of these marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes may act either as greenhouse gas (GHG) sources or sinks depending on hydrological conditions, vegetation communities, and nutrient availability. In recent decades, eutrophication has emerged as a major driver of change in salt marsh ecosystems. An ongoing fertilization experiment at the Great Sippewissett Marsh (Cape Cod, USA) allows for observation of the results of over four decades of nutrient addition. Here, nutrient enrichment stimulated changes to vegetation communities that, over time, have resulted in increased elevation of the marsh platform. In this study, we measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in dominant vegetation zones along elevation gradients of chronically fertilized (1,572kgNha(-1)year(-1)) and unfertilized (12kgNha(-1)year(-1)) experimental plots at Great Sippewissett Marsh. Flux measurements were performed using darkened chambers to focus on community respiration and excluded photosynthetic CO2 uptake. We hypothesized that N-replete conditions in fertilized plots would result in larger N2O emissions relative to control plots and that higher elevations caused by nutrient enrichment would support increased CO2 and N2O and decreased CH4 emissions due to the potential for more oxygen diffusion into sediment. Patterns of GHG emission supported our hypotheses. Fertilized plots were substantially larger sources of N2O and had higher community respiration rates relative to control plots, due to large emissions of these GHGs at higher elevations. While CH4 emissions displayed a negative relationship with elevation, they were generally small across elevation gradients and nutrient enrichment treatments. Our results demonstrate that at decadal scales, vegetation community shifts and associated elevation changes driven by chronic eutrophication affect GHG emission from salt marshes. Results demonstrate the necessity of long-term fertilization experiments to understand impacts of eutrophication on ecosystem function and have implications for how chronic eutrophication may impact the role that salt marshes play in sequestering C and N.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the contribution of different salt marsh halophytes (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus, Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia fruticosa, and Sarcocornia perennis) to nutrient cycling and sequestration in warm-temperate salt marshes. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in plant organs and rhizosediment, as well as plant biomass were monitored every two months during one year. Results show that the C retained in the rhizosediment does not seem to be species or site specific. However, some halophytes seem to have a higher contribution to retain C from external sources, namely S. perennis and S. maritima. Regarding N, halophytes colonizing the upper and middle marsh areas had the highest NBPP (net belowground primary production) as well as the retention of N in the rhizosediment. Yet, excluding S. maritimus, all halophytes seem to contribute to the retention of N from external sources. The P retained in the rhizosediment does not seem to be species or site specific. Still, only S. maritima colonizing the lower marsh areas, which also had comparatively lower NBPP, seem to have a higher contribution to retain P from external sources. Additionally, it seems that there is no relation between plants sequestration capacity for nutrients and plant photosynthetic pathway. This work shows that nutrient cycling and accumulation processes by salt marsh halophytes contribute to reduce eutrophication (N and P retention) and also to reduce atmospheric CO2 (C retention), highlighting salt marsh ecosystems services and the crucial role of halophytes in maintaining ecosystem functions and health.

AB  - Food sources for the deposit-feeding gastropods Assiminea japonica and Angustassiminea castanea (Gastropoda: Assimineidae) were estimated using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. We collected animals and potential food materials in reed marshes of the Nanakita River estuary, the eastern part of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Feeding experiments were also conducted to confirm whether snails assimilate 4 types of diets. The stable carbon isotope ratios of both assimineid species (mean +/- 1 SD: A. japonica, -20.7 +/- 0.3parts per thousand; A. castanea, -19.8 +/- 0.5parts per thousand) were closer to that of deposited organic matter from lagoon water (-20.7 +/- 0.3parts per thousand) than to those of reed litter (-25.4 +/- 0.1parts per thousand) and the surface soil of the reed marsh (-26.3 +/- 0.1parts per thousand). The snails that were fed deposited organic matter showed delta(13)C values similar to the control animals before feeding experiments for both species. The delta(13)C values of the snails fed litter or soil diet, however, revealed that these snails were able to assimilate organic matter from reed detritus under laboratory conditions. These findings suggest that the salt marsh snails utilized mainly deposited organic matter from lagoon water in the field. Microalgae such as phytoplankton and benthic diatoms in deposited matter are considered to be important food sources for 2 species of assimineids inhabiting salt marshes of the Nanakita River estuary.

AB  - Coastal marshes are known as organic matter producers. The goal of this work is to study tiller demography, standing biomass, and net aerial primary productivity (NAPP) in a Spartina densiflora coastal wetland, using a method applied to permanent sample plots located at two sites differing in topographic location, a regularly flooded zone [relative low marsh (LM)] and an irregularly flooded one [relative high marsh (HM)]. Measurements were made every 2 months during the 2005-2007 period. The annual NAPP was estimated to be 2,599 +/- 705 gDW m(-2) year(-1) for the HM and 2,181 +/- 605 gDW m(-2) year(-1) and 602 +/- 154 gDW m(-2) year(-1) for the first and second period of the LM populations, respectively, showing a seasonal pattern reaching maximum values in summer. The reduced NAPP values of the LM sites in the second year was associated with an extremely high precipitation period related to the 2007-2008 El Nio event.

AB  - Despite the fact that Anguilla rostrata (American eel) are frequently captured in salt marshes, their role in salt marsh food webs and the influence of human impacts, such as tidal restrictions, on this role remains unclear. To better understand salt marsh trophic support of A. rostrata, eels were collected from tidally restricted and unrestricted salt marsh creeks within three New England estuaries. Gut contents were examined, and eel muscle tissue was analyzed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and entered into MixSir mixing models to understand if salt marsh food sources are important contributors to eel diet. Data suggest that eel prey rely heavily on salt marsh organic matter and eels utilize salt marsh secondary production as an energetic resource over time, and thus can be considered salt marsh residents. Gut contents indicate that A. rostrata function as top predators, feeding primarily on secondary consumers including other fish species, crustaceans, and polychaetes. Higher A. rostrata trophic position measured upstream of reference creeks suggests that severe tidal restrictions may result in altered food webs, but it is not clear how this impacts the overall fitness of A. rostrata populations in New England salt marshes.

AB  - The cycling and sequestration of carbon are important ecosystem functions of estuarine wetlands that may be affected by climate change. We conducted experiments across a latitudinal and climate gradient of tidal marshes in the northeast Pacific to evaluate the effects of climate- and vegetation-related factors on litter decomposition. We manipulated tidal exposure and litter type in experimental mesocosms at two sites and used variation across marsh landscapes at seven sites to test for relationships between decomposition and marsh elevation, soil temperature, vegetation composition, litter quality, and sediment organic content. A greater than tenfold increase in manipulated tidal inundation resulted in small increases in decomposition of roots and rhizomes of two species, but no significant change in decay rates of shoots of three other species. In contrast, across the latitudinal gradient, decomposition rates of Salicornia pacifica litter were greater in high marsh than in low marsh. Rates were not correlated with sediment temperature or organic content, but were associated with plant assemblage structure including above-ground cover, species composition, and species richness. Decomposition rates also varied by litter type; at two sites in the Pacific Northwest, the grasses Deschampsia cespitosa and Distichlis spicata decomposed more slowly than the forb S. pacifica. Our data suggest that elevation gradients and vegetation structure in tidal marshes both affect rates of litter decay, potentially leading to complex spatial patterns in sediment carbon dynamics. Climate change may thus have direct effects on rates of decomposition through increased inundation from sea-level rise and indirect effects through changing plant community composition.

AB  - Soil profiles were collected in three salt marshes with different plant species (i.e. Phragmites australis, Tamarix chinensis and Suaeda salsa) in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China during three seasons (summer and fall of 2007 and the following spring of 2008) after the flow-sediment regulation regime. Total elemental contents of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic absorption spectrometry to investigate temporal variations in trace elements in soil profiles of the three salt marshes, assess the enrichment levels and ecological risks of these trace elements in three sampling seasons and identify their influencing factors. Trace elements did not change significantly along soil profiles at each site in each sampling season. The highest value for each sampling site was observed in summer and the lowest one in fall. Soils in both P. australis and S. salsa wetlands tended to have higher trace element levels than those in T. chinensis wetland. Compared to other elements, both Cd and As had higher enrichment factors exceeding moderate enrichment levels. However, the toxic unit (TU) values of these trace elements did not exceed probable effect levels. Correlation analysis showed that these trace elements were closely linked to soil properties such as moisture, sulfur, salinity, soil organic matter, soil texture and pH values. Principal component analysis showed that the sampling season affected by the flow-sediment regulation regime was the dominant factor influencing the distribution patterns of these trace elements in soils, and plant community type was another important factor. The findings of this study could contribute to wetland conservation and management in coastal regions affected by the hydrological engineering.

AB  - Different characteristics of Spartina maritima found in two distinct salt marshes located in different estuaries were analysed through interpretation of their local hydrodynamic patterns, as well as the impact of sea level rise on physical processes and consequently on plant dynamics and salt marshes stability. These salt marshes are situated in two of the most important Portuguese coastal systems, Tagus estuary (Rosario salt marsh) and Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Barra salt marsh), which are dominated by physical processes that induce strong tidal currents. They were monitored during one year and plant and sediment samples of S. maritima were collected quarterly in order to determine the vegetation coverage, above and belowground biomass, organic matter and sediment moisture. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry and tidal dissipation were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario.
   Results suggest that the different characteristics found for Spartina maritima in the Rosario and the Barra salt marshes may be related with the diverse hydrodynamic conditions identified for each salt marsh. Consequently, the exploration of SLR scenario predictions indicates how these salt marshes could evolve in the future, showing that the important changes in these hydrodynamic parameters under climate change context might induce significant modifications in the salt marshes dynamics and stability. SLR scenario could lead to changes in nutrients and sediments patterns around the salt marshes and thus vegetation coverage percentage would be affected. Additionally, as a consequence of flood duration increase, sediment moisture will increase causing a stress condition to plants. Hence, the ratio below/aboveground biomass might increase, becoming critical to plants survival under conditions of accelerated sea level rise. Accordingly, both SLR and expected changes in vegetation coverage percentage in controlling salt marshes evolution have important implications in their stability and consequently in coastal management. These conditions are unlikely to be unique to these salt marshes and it is suggested that similar analyses are replicated for other tidally dominated systems to improve understanding and characterization of their dynamics and stability under climate change context.

AB  - Environmental factors accountable for bacterioplankton or phytoplankton biomass dominance were analysed in a confined Mediterranean salt marsh (Emporda Wetlands, NE Spain). Two basins located in the same salt marsh, and with differences in size and catchment's area were compared, during four characteristic situations of the hydroperiod. Since bacterio- or phytoplankton relationships may be affected by other factors such as diel variations or vertical differences in nutrient composition and distribution, high frequency fluctuations due to these factors were also taken into account. Differences in catchment area appeared to be the more plausible explanation of differences in nutrient and organic carbon accumulation among basins, since during confinement basins essentially accumulate the allochthonous nutrient and organic matter supplies that previously entered by runoff. DOC (Dissolved Organic Carbon) favoured the bacterioplankton biomass increase, but also was the main variable significantly affecting phytoplankton biomass. Basins showed marked differences in bacterio- and phytoplankton dominances. Relationships between phytoplankton and bacterioplankton were positive, negative or not significant, depending on the basin and on the period of the year. The phytoplankton mixotrophic capabilities, both phagotrophy and osmotrophy, and their production of UV-screening compounds, as sunscreen, may explain the significant correlation between DOC and phytoplankton biomass, and the significant effect of phytoplankton on bacterioplankton found in these ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes are important coastal environments that provide key ecological services. As sea level rise has accelerated globally, concerns about the ability of salt marshes to survive submergence are increasing. Previous estimates of likely survival of salt marshes were based on ratios of sea level rise to marsh platform accretion. Here we took advantage of an unusual, long-term(1979-2015), spatially detailed comparison of changes in a representative New England salt marsh to provide an empirical estimate of habitat losses based on actual measurements. We show prominent changes in habitat mosaic within the marsh, consistent and coincident with increased submergence and coastal erosion. Model results suggest that at current rates of sea level rise, marsh platform accretion, habitat loss, and with the limitation of the widespread "coastal squeeze", the entire ecosystem might disappear by the beginning of the next century, a fate that might be likely for many salt marshes elsewhere. Meta-analysis of available data suggests that 40 to 95% of the world's salt marshes will be submerged, depending on whether sea level rise remains at current or reaches anticipated rates for the end of this century.

AB  - The effects of 380 and 720 mumol mol-1 atmospheric CO2 on growth, dry matter allocation, net leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of the C3 salt marsh species Aster tripolium L. and Puccinellia maritima (Hudson) Parl. were studied.  Plants were grown in pots under combinations of low (50-250 mM NaCl) or high (450-550 mM NaCl) salinity and non-flooded or flooded salt marsh soil.  High salinity reduced growth of both species, while flooding increased biomass production of A. tripolium.  Root weight of A. tripolium and total plant weight of P. maritima was increased by atmospheric CO2 enrichment when the soil was flooded.  Under non-flooded conditions, the effect of elevated CO2 on growth was small (P. maritima) or absent (A. tripolium).  The relative increase in total plant weight of both species by elevated CO2 was higher under saline conditions.  Dry matter allocation between root, stem and leaf, as reflected in leaf weight ratio and shoot to root ratio, was not changed by elevated CO2, while specific leaf area was slightly decreased by CO2 enrichment.  Elevated CO2 stimulated net leaf photosynthesis of both species, while stomatal conductance decreased.  These effects were not changed by salinity or flooding treatment.

AB  - The environmental significance of atmospheric emissions resulting from in-situ burning used as remediation technique for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons entering Louisiana coastal salt marshes was quantified. Research conducted documented atmospheric pollutants produced and emitted to the atmosphere as the result of burning of oil contaminated wetlands. Samples collected from the smoke plume contained a variety of gaseous sulfur and carbon compounds. Carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the main volatile sulfur compounds. In contrast, concentrations of sulfur dioxide were almost negligible. Concentrations of methane and carbon dioxide in the smoke plume increased compared to ambient levels. Air samples collected for aromatic hydrocarbons in the smoke plume were dominated by pyrogenic or combustion derived aromatic hydrocarbons. The particulate fi action was nominated by phenanthrene and the C-I and C-2 alkylated phenanthrene homologues. The vapor fr action was dominated bq, naphthalene and the C-l to C-3 naphthalene homologues. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal marsh restoration using dredged material is being undertaken in many coastal areas to replace lost habitat and ecosystem services due to tidal marsh loss. The fate of high levels of nitrogen (N) in fine-grained dredged material used as a substrate for marsh restoration is uncertain, but if exported tidally may cause subtidal habitat degradation. In this study, a mass balance was developed to characterize N fluxes in a two-year-old restored tidal marsh constructed with fine-grained dredged material at Poplar Island, MD, in Chesapeake Bay, and to evaluate the potential impact on the adjacent submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat. Denitrification and N accumulation in Spartina organic matter were identified as the major sinks (21.31 and 28.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1), respectively), while tidal export of TN was more modest (9.4 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and inorganic N export was low (1.59 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). Internal cycling helped retain N within the marsh. Mineralization of N associated with labile organic matter in the dredged material was likely a large, but unquantified, source of N supporting robust plant growth and N exports. Exceedances of SAV water quality habitat requirements in the subtidal region adjacent to the marsh were driven by elevated Chesapeake Bay concentrations rather than enrichment by the marsh.

AB  - While former salt marsh sites filled with human transported material (HTM) have altered the surface marsh ecosystem, if artificial drainage is absent, subsurface conditions may continue favorable for denitrification, a microbial process reducing nitrogen (N) export to estuaries. We used piezometer networks to evaluate the in situ groundwater denitrification capacity and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux (with N-15-enriched nitrate-N via the push-pull method) in four former fringing salt marshes topped by HTM along the Rhode Island coast, U.S.A. Groundwater at these sites commonly interacted with the buried marsh horizon and the HTM. In situ groundwater denitrification capacity site means ranged from 15.2 to 71.7 mu g N kg(-1)d(-1) with no significant differences between sites due to high intrasite variability. The site with the highest and most consistent denitrification capacity also had HTM of the finest texture and highest soluble organic carbon. Three of four sites had minimal N2O flux [mean N2O:(N2O + N-2) = 0.082] while the final site had N2O generation rates up to 52.5 mu g N kg(-1) d(-1). The site with the highest N2O contributions also had the lowest ambient groundwater nitrate-N indicating lack of priming for N2O reduction to N-2. Former salt marshes with HTM deposits may still have the capacity for substantial groundwater denitrification capacity, similar to that observed in undisturbed salt marshes, but may also contribute substantially to global N2O emissions. For both salt marsh restoration and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, attention should be given to ensuring that a tidally-driven, fluctuating water table regularly intercepts the buried organic horizons of the filled salt marsh.

AB  - Mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems are one of the most productive ecosystems in terrestrial systems, playing an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. The anaerobic condition in coastal wetland usually impedes the decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the intrinsic stabilization mechanisms of SOC other than environmental factors are poorly understood in coastal wetland. In this paper, we investigated the relative contribution of mineral association and chemical compounds in maintaining the stabilization of SOC in the mangrove; salt marsh ecotone, and how the microbial community is involved in the stabilization. From NMR spectroscopy, we found that the SOC molecular structure of Sparffna. altemillora soils is simpler than that in mangrove forest, indicating an increased SOC decomposition with invasion of S. altemillora. On the contrary, the molecular structure of SOC in mangrove forest was dominated by recalcitrant aromatic C. Meanwhile, the larger fractions of silt/clay content in S. alterniflora and the transitional community were corresponding to higher percentage of mineral organic carbon (MOC), which suggest that the SOC in S. alterniflora vegetated soil was mainly protected by the mineral association. The transitional community contained highest MOC content probably due to both physical protection of mineral association and recalcitrant C input from adjacent mangroves. We also found that the fraction of SOC and its chemical structure of functional groups were associated with microbial communities. This study revealed the occurrence of different SOC stabilization mechanisms between mangroves and salt marshes. The knowledge gained may help to make predictions about future SOC dynamics as the different stabilization processes may response to climate change or human activities differently.

AB  - The total methane emission to the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and its seasonal variation, were estimated using an enclosed static chamber technique from a tidal marshes dominated by Phragmites australis (common reed) in the Min River estuary, southeast China. Measurements were taken at three tidal stages ( before flood, during the flooding and ebbing process, and after ebb). Potential rates of methane production from the marsh sediment layers were also measured using an incubation technique. This P. australis tidal marsh was a net methane source, emitting 32.59 and 6.87 g CH4.m(-2).yr(-1) to the atmosphere and hydrosphere, respectively. There was considerable monthly variation with emissions greater before flood in some months, whereas at other months emission was greater after ebb. The average methane fluxes were 5.13, 5.06 and 4.74 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) before flood, during flooding and ebbing, and after ebb, respectively. Emissions to the tidewater and the atmosphere during the flooding and ebbing process were 2.98 and 2.08 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Sediment methane production potential (0-40 cm depth) ranged from 0.028-0.123 mu g CH4.g(-1).d(-1), with the greatest production was in the surface soil. Methane fluxes had a significant correlation with atmospheric, sediment temperature and above ground biomass. The implications of these data for global warming are discussed briefly.

AB  - Salt marshes are delicate landforms at the boundary between the sea and land. These ecosystems support a diverse biota that modifies the erosive characteristics of the substrate and mediates sediment transport processes. Here we present a broad overview of recent numerical models that quantify the formation and evolution of salt marshes under different physical and ecological drivers. In particular, we focus on the coupling between geomorphological and ecological processes and on how these feedbacks are included in predictive models of landform evolution. We describe in detail models that simulate fluxes of water, organic matter, and sediments in salt marshes. The interplay between biological and morphological processes often produces a distinct scarp between salt marshes and tidal flats. Numerical models can capture the dynamics of this boundary and the progradation or regression of the marsh in time. Tidal channels are also key features of the marsh landscape, flooding and draining the marsh platform and providing a source of sediments and nutrients to the marsh ecosystem. In recent years, several numerical models have been developed to describe the morphogenesis and long-term dynamics of salt marsh channels. Finally, salt marshes are highly sensitive to the effects of long-term climatic change. We therefore discuss in detail how numerical models have been used to determine salt marsh survival under different scenarios of sea level rise.

AB  - The effect of pedohydrological regime caused by pulsed rainfall events (PRE) on the dynamics of dissolved iron in wetland soil solutions was examined through in-situ sampling of three typical wetlands (perennial Carex lasiocarpa humus marsh, seasonal submerged Calamgrostis angustifolia meadow marsh, and seasonal dry paddy field) in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. The results showed that the dissolved iron of the upper soil layers (10 cm) of the three wetland soils corresponded to the pedohydrological regime to some extent, while the effect on the deeper layers (20-60 cm) was insignificant The Eh and pH response of the meadow marsh soil to PRE was much greater than the other two soils. Dissolved iron in the humus marsh soil showed more regularity than the other two soils. The negative significant correlations between Fe(II) and redox potential (Eh), Fe(III) and Eh, and Fe(III)/Fe(II) and pH were only observed in the humus marsh soil. As a redox indicator, Fe(III)/Fe(II) had a significantly positive correlation with Eh. Fe (II) was less correlated with Fe(III) than other chemical parameters during PRE. The total dissolved iron (Fe(II)+Fe(III)) had significantly positive correlation with total nitrogen (TN) in the humus marsh soil, while that of the meadow marsh soil had significantly positive correlation with TN, total phosphorus (TP), and total carbon (TC). These findings will be useful to better understand the environmental behavior of iron and their influencing factors, and provides an improved scientific basis for understanding the environmental fate of iron in wetland soils.

AB  - Salt marshes are anticipated to be exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 and high salinity due to sea-level rise in the future. This study aims to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and high salinity on microbial communities using intact cores collected from a salt marsh in North Wales, UK. The cores were exposed to two levels of CO2 (ambient vs. ambient + 200 ppm) and two levels of salinity (control vs. control + 10 ppt) over a growing season in the Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) facility. We focused on the abundances of bacteria, sulfate reducers (SRB), methanogens and denitrifiers as they play a central role in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the activities of extracellular enzymes were determined to assess the effects on microbial activity, followed by Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to elucidate possible mechanism for the changes we observed. Elevated CO2 significantly increased DOC in pore water for the control salinity treatment during a vigorous growing season (i.e., May - Aug) but not the high salinity treatment. Microbial diversity presented by Shannon's diversity derived from T-RFLP analysis showed no significant changes except for nirS genes, suggesting potential influence of elevated CO2 on denitrification. Microbial abundances changed substantially for certain functional groups; For example, the abundance of SRB increased both by elevated CO2 and high salinity. In contrast, total bacterial abundance declined under the treatment of high salinity. SEM suggests that elevated CO2 increases DOC in pore-water, which increased sulfate reducers. Salinity plays an additional role in this process to selectively increasing SRB without affecting methanogens. Overall, the results of this study suggest that SRB will play a key role in organic matter decomposition in salt marshes as atmospheric CO2 and salinity increase. This is most likely to be mediated by changes in the quantity and the quality of organic carbon derived from salt marsh vegetation.

AB  - The resilience of salt marshes to sea level rise depends on vertical accretion through belowground biomass production and sediment deposition to maintain elevation above sea level. Increased nitrogen (N) availability from anthropogenic sources may stimulate aboveground biomass production and sediment deposition and, thus, accretion; however, increased N may also negatively impact marsh accretion by decreasing belowground biomass and increasing net CO2 emissions. A study was conducted in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, to determine how responses to fertilization vary across locations with different physical and chemical characteristics. Pore water residence time, inundation time, and proximity to tidal creeks drove spatial differences in pore water sulfide, ammonium, and dissolved carbon concentrations. Although annual respiration and gross primary production were greater at the creek edge than interior marsh sites, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was nearly balanced at all the sites. Fertilization decreased belowground biomass in the interior sites but not on the creek edge. Aboveground biomass, respiration, gross primary production, and net CO2 emissions increased in response to fertilization, but responses were diminished in interior marsh locations with high pore water sulfide. Hourly NEE measured by chambers were similar to hourly NEE observed by a nearby eddy covariance tower, but correcting for inundation depth relative to plant height was critical for accurate extrapolation to annual fluxes. The impact of fertilization on biomass and NEE, and thus marsh resilience, varied across marsh locations depending upon location-specific pore water sulfide concentrations.

AB  - The seasonality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) export from a New England salt marsh was investigated using multiple estuary transects along with laboratory plant leaching experiments. From 2001 through 2013, 35 transects of the Neponset Estuary in Boston, Massachusetts, were conducted to measure high-resolution in situ chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, along with other standard oceanographic parameters, via sensors incorporated into an undulating depressor wing known as the mini-shuttle. Water samples were collected during each cruise for discrete dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM fluorescence analyses. Seasonal salt marsh DOC export rates ranged from 1.1 x 10(7) to 15 x 10(7) mol C season(-1) (10-140 mol C m(-2) season(-1)). The total export was found to be 23 +/- 17 x 10(7) mol C y(-1) (210 mol C m(-2) y(-1)) with river discharge, temperature, and day length significantly affecting this rate. Results from seasonal salt marsh vegetation (Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, and Phragmites australis) incubation experiments showed that the leaching of DOC and CDOM from plant biomass was a rapid process occurring over several days. Sunlight exposure, biomass type (above-versus belowground biomass), and microbial activity had significant effects on DOC leaching rates from plant matter. These incubations, in conjunction with the cruise data, support the fall dump hypothesis, in which a pulse of DOC leaches from plants during the fall as marsh plants begin to senesce for winter. The long-term trend in salt marsh DOM contributions to the estuary suggested a decrease in the in situ inputs from the marsh to the estuary during the length of this study.

AB  - Recovery following salt marsh restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico is investigated using meta-analysis for two salt marsh indicator invertebrates, the periwinkle snail (Littoraria irrorata) and amphipod crustaceans (Amphipoda). These invertebrates serve key marsh ecosystem functions including facilitating nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger ecologically and economically important species. Recovery of periwinkles in restored marshes compared to reference sites is quantified by progression in population density and, because the species is long-lived (~ 10 years), in terms of biomass added per unit area each year following restoration. Amphipods are shorter-lived with high annual turnover; thus, recovery through time is estimated by the density of individuals rather than by biomass. The results of the analyses indicate progressive periwinkle recovery to equivalence with reference systems by year 4 in terms of density and year 6 with respect to annual biomass addition, while amphipod densities do not fully recover in the first 20 years following restoration. Although periwinkle recovery in terms of annual biomass addition reaches equivalence by year 6, the development of an age class structure characteristic of reference marshes would likely take longer because of the relatively long lifespan for this species. In addition to providing insight into the benefits of salt marsh restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the approach described can be applied more generally to restoration scaling in a natural resource damage assessment context.

AB  - An accelerating global rate of sea level rise (SLR), coupled with direct human impacts to coastal watersheds and shorelines, threatens the continued survival of salt marshes. We developed a new landscape-scale numerical model of salt marsh evolution and applied it to marshes in the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, U.S.A.), a sediment-deficient system bounded by steep uplands. To capture complexities of vertical accretion across the marsh platform, we employed a novel approach that incorporates spatially variable suspended sediment concentrations and biomass of multiple plant species as functions of elevation and distance from sediment sources. The model predicts a stable areal extent of Plum Island marshes for a variety of SLR scenarios through 2100, where limited marsh drowning is compensated by limited marsh migration into adjacent uplands. Nevertheless, the model predicts widespread conversion of high marsh vegetation to low marsh vegetation, and accretion deficits that indicate eventual marsh drowning. Although sediment-deficient marshes bounded by steep uplands are considered extremely vulnerable to SLR, our results highlight that marshes with high elevation capital can maintain their areal extent for decades to centuries even under conditions in which they will inevitably drown.

AB  - Salt marshes can play a vital role in mitigating the effects of global environmental change by dissipating incident storm wave energy and, through accretion, tracking increasing water depths consequent upon sea level rise. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nutrient availability are two key variables that can affect the biological processes that contribute to marsh surface elevation gain. We measured the effects of CO2 concentrations and nutrient availability on surface elevation change in intact mixed-species blocks of UK salt marsh using six open-top chambers receiving CO2-enriched (800ppm) or ambient (400ppm) air. We found more rapid surface elevation gain in elevated CO2 conditions: an average increase of 3.4mm over the growing season relative to ambient CO2. Boosted regression analysis to determine the relative influence of different parameters on elevation change identified that a 10% reduction in microbial activity in elevated CO2-grown blocks had a positive influence on elevation. The biomass of Puccinellia maritima also had a positive influence on elevation, while other salt marsh species (e.g. Suaeda maritima) had no influence or a negative impact on elevation. Reduced rates of water use by the vegetation in the high CO2 treatment could be contributing to elevation gain, either directly through reduced soil shrinkage or indirectly by decreasing microbial respiration rates due to lower redox levels in the soil. Eutrophication did not influence elevation change in either CO2 treatment despite doubling aboveground biomass. The role of belowground processes (transpiration, root growth and decomposition) in the vertical adjustment of European salt marshes, which are primarily minerogenic in composition, could increase as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and should be considered in future wetland models for the region. Elevated CO2 conditions could enhance resilience in vulnerable systems such as those with low mineral sediment supply or where migration upwards within the tidal frame is constrained.

AB  - Introduction of exotic Spartina alterniflora (S. alternifiora) is important to re-establish the structure and function of salt marsh ecosystems along the coast of China. Characterization the spatial-temporal patterns of S. alternifiora soils is thus essential for the assessment of the pace of ecosystem development. However, the determination of soil properties by traditional analysis almost impossible achieve a timely detection of soil changes that is generally required by soil monitoring tasks for demonstrating impacts of S. alternifiora invasion. This work focused on the use of visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) for characterizing soils and predicting key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alterniflora areas. A set of soil profiles representing a chronosequence of S. alternifiora invasion was used, comprising 45 samples from 15 sites. The results showed that approximately 20-year of S. alterniflora invasion has altered soil characteristics especially in the topsoil. Changes of soil associated with sampling horizons and ages of S. alternifiora could be distinguishable using soil variables and VNIRS, and high correlations were found between soils and spectra information. The results of predictions showed that predictive accuracy for salinity, pH, clay, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, organic carbon and calcium carbonate were acceptable, but models for total nitrogen, bulk density, sand and silt were less satisfactory. These results suggested the possibility of VNIRS for the rapid assessment of key physical and chemical soil properties in S. alternifiora areas. This work highlights that VNIRS technique could be taken as a useful tool to investigate soil changes and explore understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.

AB  - The effects of tidal restrictions by diking on salt marsh biogeochemistry were interpreted by comparing the hydrology, porewater chemistry and solid phase composition of both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes with adjacent natural salt marshes on Cape God, Massachusetts. Flooding periods were greatest in natural and least in drained marshes.
   Differences between the chemistry of the natural and diked marshes depended upon the depth of the water table and the supply of sulfate for anaerobic metabolism. Drained marsh sediments were highly acidic (pH < 4) with porewaters rich in dissolved Fe; the natural and diked flooded marshes had pH 6-7.5 and Fe orders of magnitude lower. Porewater nutrients, sulfides and alkalinity were much lower in both flooded and drained diked marshes than in the natural marsh.
   Sediments of the drained marsh had subsided 90 cm relative to the natural site due to organic matter decomposition and compaction. However, despite the loss of organic matter, much of the P and N was retained, with NH4 likely protected from nitrification by low pH and PO4 adsorbed on Fe and Al oxides. Iron, and to a lesser degree sulfur, had also been well retained by the sediment. Despite eight decades of diking, substantial amounts of reduced S, representing potential acidity, persisted near the top of the water table.
   In contrast, the surface of the seasonally flooded marsh was only 15 cm below the natural marsh. Accretion since diking amounted to 25 cm and involved proportionally less mineral matter.
   The restoration of seawater flow to both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes will likely extend flooding depth and duration, lower redox, increase cation exchange, and thereby increase NH4, Fe(II), and PO4 mobilization. Increased porewater nutrients could benefit recolonizing halophytes but may also degrade surface water quality.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon refers to the carbon taken from atmospheric CO2; fixed by advanced plants (including salt marsh, mangrove, and seagrass), phytoplankton, macroalgae, and marine calcifiers via the interaction of plants and microbes; and stored in nearshore sediments and soils; as well as the carbon transported from the coast to the ocean and ocean floor. The carbon sequestration capacity per unit area of coastal blue carbon is far greater than that of the terrestrial carbon pool. The mechanisms and controls of the carbon sink from salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, the aquaculture of shellfish and macroalgae, and the microbial carbon pump need to be further studied. The methods to quantify coastal blue carbon include carbon flux measurements, carbon pool measurements, manipulative experiments, and modeling. Restoring, conserving, and enhancing blue carbon will increase carbon sinks and produce carbon credits, which could be traded on the carbon market. The need to tackle climate change and implement China's commitment to cut carbon emissions requires us to improve studies on coastal blue carbon science and policy. The knowledge learned from coastal blue carbon improves the conservation and restoration of salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses; enhances the function of the microbial carbon pump; and promotes sustainable aquaculture, such as ocean ranching.

AB  - Reclaimed salt marshes are fragile environments where water salinization and accumulation of heavy metals can easily occur. This type of environment constitutes a large part of the Po River Delta (Italy), where intensive agricultural activities take place. Given the higher Ni background of Po River Delta soils and its water-soluble nature, the main aim of this contribution is to understand if reclamation can influence the Ni behavior over time. In this study, we investigated the geo-chemical features of 40 soils sampled in two different localities from the Po River Delta with different reclamation ages. Samples of salt marsh soils reclaimed in 1964 were taken from Valle del Mezzano while soils reclaimed in 1872 were taken nearby Codigoro town. Batch solubility tests and consecutive determination of Ni in pore-water were compared to bulk physicochemical compositions of soils. Bulk Ni content of the studied soils is naturally high, since these soils originated from Po River sediments derived from the erosion of ultramafic rocks. Moreover, it seems that Ni concentration increases during soil evolution, being probably related to the degradation of serpentine. Instead, the water-soluble Ni measured in the leaching tests is greater in soils recently reclaimed compared to the oldest soils. Soil properties of two soil profiles from a reclaimed wetland area were examined to determine soil evolution over one century. Following reclamation, pedogenic processes of the superficial horizons resulted in organic matter mineralization, pH buffer, and a decrease of Ni water solubility from recently to evolved reclaimed soil.

AB  - Wetland soil microorganisms are probably influenced by fluctuating water levels and by longer-term climatic change. This study investigated production of CH4 and reduced S gases [H2S, CH3SH, (CH3)(2)S, COS, and CS2] by both freshly collected and air-dried, rewet soils from four wetlands in the Mississippi deltaic plain. Soils from three depth intervals (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) from a swamp forest (Typic Hydraquent), a freshwater marsh (Terric Medisaprist), an intermediate salinity marsh (Typic Medisaprist), and a salt marsh (Typic Medisaprist) were incubated under anaerobic conditions. At repeated time intervals, the headspace gas was analyzed and then purged with N-2. Peak production rates of both CH4 and H2S occurred earlier in the fresh soils than in the dried soils in almost all cases. Presumably, this time lag associated with drying was caused by an increase in potentially reducible Mn and Fe. Nevertheless, drying increased labile C levels, thus total CH4 production was similar during the entire 69-d incubation. Production of CH4 was positively correlated with organic matter content (fresh, R(2) = 0.52; dried, R(2) = 0.64) and labile C (fresh, R(2) = 0.83; dried, R(2) = 0.89). Due to their relatively low concentrations, inclusion of soil oxidants in a model did not significantly improve the fit of a model that already contained a term for labile C. Production of S gases was positively correlated with initial SO42- concentrations (fresh, R(2) = 0.,75; dried, R(2) = 0.42). Drying significantly decreased total H2S production only for the salt marsh soils. In contrast, the drying treatment increased CH3SH production; only these soils produced (CH3)(2)S, COS, and CS2.

AB  - Coastal marshes have among the highest rates of soil carbon accumulation of any ecosystem on Earth, yet they are increasingly being lost due to high rates of relative sea-level rise, changes to their hydrology, and other natural and anthropogenic factors. To mitigate some of this wetland loss, restoration strategies in Louisiana have been focused on creating marshes using dredge spoil and diverting river flow into deteriorating wetland basins. Here, we aimed to compare these two different restoration approaches in terms of the development of soil carbon and nitrogen within the root zone (top 30 cm) by examining two chronosequences of newly formed marshes that span 32- and 25-year timeframes-one of which was a series of brackish, created marshes in the Chenier Plain (Sabine; marsh creation), and the other, a series of deltaic, tidal, freshwater marshes in the currently prograding Wax Lake Delta (WLD; sediment diversion). We also assessed the vegetation coverage and the relative chemical stability of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen (refractory versus labile) that has accumulated across these restoration sites. We observed that vegetation coverage initially increased more rapidly in the Sabine marshes, but it was similar to that in the WLD marshes by similar to 30 years post-establishment. Whereas the soil carbon pool reached similar quantities between the two chronosequences, it increased nearly twice as fast on average in WLD versus Sabine. The density of soil nitrogen closely tracked soil carbon in WLD, but it remained uniform across the Sabine marshes. Refractory soil carbon accounted for 59 +/- 12% of the total soil carbon, and the refractory carbon pool increased at a rate that was similar between both chronosequences, despite the characteristic differences in salinity, nutrient input, plant species composition, and mineral sedimentation rates. Overall, our results suggest that marshes formed from sediment diversions in Louisiana have the potential to rival or outpace marshes created using dredge sediment in terms of vegetation and soil organic matter development.

AB  - Salt marshes are complex systems comprising ephemerally flooded, vegetated platforms hydraulically fed by tidal creeks. Where drainage is poor, formation of saline-water ponds can occur. Within East Anglian (UK) salt marshes, two types of sediment chemistries can be found beneath these ponds; iron-rich sediment, which is characterized by high ferrous iron concentration in subsurface porewaters (up to 2 mM in the upper 30 cm); and sulfide-rich sediment, which is characterized by high porewater sulfide concentrations (up to 8 mM). We present 5 years of push-core sampling to explore the geochemistry of the porewater in these two types of sediment. We suggest that when organic carbon is present in quantities sufficient to exhaust the oxygen and iron content within pond sediments, conditions favor the presence of sulfide-rich sediments. In contrast, in pond sediments where oxygen is present, primarily through bioirrigation, reduced iron can be reoxidised and thus recycled for further reduction, favoring the perpetuation of iron-rich sedimentary conditions. We find these pond sediments can alter significantly over an annual timescale. We carried out a drone survey, with ground-truthed measurements, to explore the spatial distribution of geochemistry in these ponds. Our results suggest that a pond's proximity to a creek partially determines the pond subsurface geochemistry, with iron-rich ponds tending to be closer to large creeks than sulfide-rich ponds. We suggest differences in surface delivery of organic carbon, due to differences in the energy of the ebb flow, or the surface/subsurface delivery of iron may control the distribution. This could be amplified if tidal inundations flush ponds closer to creeks more frequently, removing carbon and flushing with oxygen. These results suggest that anthropogenic creation of drainage ditches could shift the distribution of iron- and sulfide-rich ponds and thus have an impact on nutrient, trace metal and carbon cycling in salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - The salt marsh system on the tidal flat is one of the most productively ecological wetlands with high biological productivity and blue carbon sequestration levels. The evolution of salt marshes-bare flats boundaries and the shapes of salt marsh margins are of scientific and engineering prospects due to the capability on indicating the morphodynamic patterns of tidal flats. Previous studies are almost qualitative, so far, quantitative analysis on this issue is scarce. To improve our understandings on the spatio-temporal characteristics of salt marsh margins and the mechanism underpinning, we extracted datasets on Spartina alterniflora using orthoimages derived from the quarterly-surveyed UAV photographs and satellite imagery. Results show that the patch-size distribution corresponded to the power law, indicating the marsh patches are in the state of self-organized criticality and the system is scale-independent. It was observed that the external dynamic conditions (i.e., the sediment erosion and accretion on the tidal flat) imposed negative impacts on the self-organization process. In particular, when the short-term morphological changes were negligible, R2 of the power-law relationship notably increased to nearly 1, indicating the salt marsh patches tended to adhere to a high-order self-organization structure in this process.

AB  - Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon isotopic (delta(13)C) compositions and n-alkane (nC(16-38)) concentrations were measured for Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 marsh grass, Typha latifolia, a C-3 marsh grass, and three sediment cores collected from middle and upper estuarine sites from the Plum Island salt marshes. Our results indicated that the organic matter preserved in the sediments was highly affected by the marsh plants that dominated the sampling sites. delta(13)C values of organic matter preserved in the upper fresh water site sediment were more negative (-23.0+/-0.3) as affected by the C-3 plants than the values of organic matter preserved in the sediments of middle (-18.9+/-0.8) and mud flat sites (-19.4+/-0.1) as influenced mainly by the C4 marsh plants. The distribution of n-alkanes measured in all sediments showed similar patterns as those determined in the marsh grasses S. alterniflora and T. latifolia, and nC(21) to nC(33) long-chain n-alkanes were the major compounds determined in all sediment samples. The strong odd-to-even carbon numbered n-alkane predominance was found in all three sediments and nC(29) was the most abundant homologue in all samples measured. Both delta(13)C compositions of organic matter and n-alkane distributions in these sediments indicate that the marsh plants could contribute significant amount of organic matter preserved in Plum Island salt marsh sediments. This suggests that salt marshes play an important role in the cycling of nutrients and organic carbon in the estuary and adjacent coastal waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The distribution and accumulation of rare earth elements (REE) in the labile fraction of sediment cores collected from salt marshes in the Patos Lagoon estuary from southern Brazil were investigated. Sediment cores (ca. 40 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in REE content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominate). Salt marsh sediments from all three coring locations were enriched in the light REE (LREE) over the heavy REE (HREE) when normalized to the North American shale composite (NASC). Shale normalized values for the LREE of marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary commonly approximates unity indicating these sediments chiefly exhibit a terrigenous signature. In contrast, all 14 naturally occurring REE are depleted in the sediments from the M1 coring location in the lower estuary compared to shale. Sediments from the mid-estuary (M2 core location) where typical salinity values are ca. 10 practical salinity units, exhibit the greatest shale normalized LREE enrichments. The higher LREE contents of the M2 sediments likely reflect preferential removal of LREE from the water column owing to salt-induced coagulation of river-borne colloids that occurs during estuarine mixing processes. Sediments samples collected from the salt marsh in the lower estuary nearer the Atlantic Ocean (i.e., M1), have substantially lower REE contents than salt marsh sediments from sites M2 and M3 in the mid- and upper estuary, respectively. The more sand-rich lower estuary sediments are exposed to higher salinity water from the South Atlantic compared to the generally finer grained sediments from the mid- and upper estuary, which are dominated by brackish and freshwater conditions, respectively. Negative Ce-anomalies (i.e., Ce/Ce* < 1) in marsh sediments from depths generally greater than 27 cm support the occurrence of early diagenetic reactions consistent with suboxic to anoxic conditions whereby reductive dissolution of ferromanganese oxide/oxyhydroxide carrier phases, and/or Ce(IV) phases, release Ce(III) to the marsh pore waters. The negative Ce anomalies suggests that a suboxic or anoxic environment predominates to a depth of 9 cm, and then again below 27 cm depth in sediments from the M2 salt marsh core, and below a depth of 13 cm in the upper estuary marsh sediments (i.e., M3). In contrast, positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* > 1) for much of the sediment from the M1 core, the mid depths of core M2 (i.e., 9 cm to 27 cm), and shallower than 13 cm in sediments from core M3 support oxic conditions where Ce is enriched in sediments from these depths by preferential scavenging from pore waters onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides. These trends in Ce/Ce* with depth in each sediment core are also consistent with known bioturbation that occurs within these marsh sediments. The relatively high REE contents of the sediments from location M3 are also related to the fact that these sediments are dominantly composed of clay-silt deposits that are enriched in organic matter. Finally, we find no conclusive evidence that the studied salt marsh sediments have been impacted by addition of REE from the local fertilizer manufacturing industry.

AB  - The salt marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) is a common and often abundant mollusk in marshes of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States. Several studies have focused on the effects of periwinkles on Spartina alterniflora production and the effects of oil on periwinkle survivability, yet the general ecology of the snail has been underreported. In this study, we measured spatial distributions, biomass, shell repair frequency, and a suite of morphological characteristics of L. irrorata at three sites in each of five regions spanning the southeastern Louisiana Coast between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi rivers. Sampling was conducted along 50 m edge-to-interior transects in S. alterniflora-dominated marshes. We found that L. irrorata density, individual biomass, and total areal biomass significantly varied by region. Each also significantly varied with distance from the marsh edge, with the exception of total periwinkle areal biomass. We saw a general trend across most regions where periwinkle density tended to be greatest 10 m from the marsh edge and biomass tended to be greatest 20-30 m from the marsh edge; however, neither periwinkle density nor biomass was related to S. alterniflora density or stem height. The allometric relationship between shell length and biomass varied significantly between all regions, indicating that this species has differing regional growth patterns. A possible driver of these regional patterns in allometry is differences in predation pressures, with increased predation scaring at Port Fourchon sites corresponding to snails with larger shells yet less internal biomass per length compared to other regions. This study provides the first large-scale description of the spatial ecology and regional morphometry of the salt marsh periwinkle, an important organism in structuring salt marsh ecosystems, and suggests that the pressures exerted by L. irrorata on plant production found in other studies likely varies by geography and spatial location within a marsh.

AB  - Climate change has created a need for solutions that can counteract greenhouse gas emissions. One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled "blue carbon ecosystems" including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from Pb-210 profiles ranged 0.011-0.022 g C cm(-3), 4228-8178 g C m(-2), and 17-45 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.

AB  - Marisma, one of the largest salt-marsh alluvial areas in SW Spain, has been reclaimed since 1970 by artificial drainage and amendment with phosphogypsum (PG) so as to reduce Na+ saturation. Within the reclaimed area, two 250- x 20-m plots were treated as follows: (1) amendment with 25 Mg/ha of PG every 2 to 3 years between 1979 and 2003 (plot PY); (2) like PY but PG treatment stopped after 1997 (plot DR). A contiguous virgin Marisma salt-marsh plot (MV), neither drained nor amended, was the control. In MV, soil microbial biomass C, most enzyme activities and total organic C content were much greater than in PY and DR soils, despite the salinity stress. The decrease in soil organic matter content in PY and DR soils was likely due to cotton-cropping practices, which favoured the organic C mineralisation and nutrients removal by crops. Microbial activity of MV soil, probably stimulated by the rhizodepositions of the natural vegetation, did not suffer from the osmotic effect due to the raising of soil solution ionic strength. Microbial quotient could be ranked as MV > PY > DR, whereas the metabolic quotient had an opposite trend. Thus, both quotients suggested that the interruption of PG amendment was not favouring microbial activity. Principal component analysis clearly identified the chemical and biochemical soil properties mostly affected by the reclamation and also indicated the longer PG amendment in PY plot. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified two physiologically different types of soil microflora, one less active present in the MV virgin soil and another more active present in the reclaimed PY and DR soils.

AB  - Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds was determined by the volumetric method in soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes of the Barents Sea (Khaypudyrskaya Bay). Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of C-org varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the C-org/N-tot ratio varied from 10 to 18. Humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments were described in the middle part of the marsh soil profile. In the second group, the contents of C-org was 430-470 g/kg and N-tot 4-7 g/kg. The C-org/N-tot ratio in the surface peat horizons equaled to 64-95 g/kg and decreased by three-seven times in the deeper layers. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded each tide and especially their surface horizons contained more inorganic carbon than any other soils. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varied from 4 to 20% of the total carbon content. Seawater and carbonate-containing rocks could be the source of the inorganic carbon. A correlation was found between the contents of C-org and N-tot in soils and in plant communities growing on these soils. Additional input of C-org and N-tot into marsh soils was due to the living activity of birds and to organic substances in seawater.

AB  - The effects of various water-table depths during continuous and simulated tidal drainage on CO2 emissions and soil Eh were examined in intact fresh, brackish, and saline marsh soil cores. CO2 emissions did not differ between continuous and tidal drainage. CO2 emissions were greatest in fresh cores and least in brackish cores at all water-table depths tested. Eh was higher in brackish cores and lower in fresh and saline cores at all water-table depths tested. Eh increased with decreasing water-table depth and increased more during continuous drainage than during tidal drainage. These results exclude the possibility that reported differences in field measurements of CO2 emission among fresh, brackish, and saline marsh soils relate to different hydrological conditions in the marsh types; they also indicate that fundamental differences in decomposition processes and soil Eh exist among these marsh types. Although not tested, differences were attributed to the different species of emergent vegetation occupying the different marsh types and which are the sources of soil organic matter.

AB  - Pools of Zn, Cu, Cd and Co in leaf, stem and root tissues of Sarcocornia fruticosa, Sarcocornia perennis, Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima were analyzed on a bimonthly basis, in a Tagus estuary salt marsh. All the major concentrations were found in the root tissues, being the concentrations in the aboveground organs neglectable for sediment budget proposes, as seen by the low root-aboveground translocation. Metal annual accumulation, root turnovers and cycling coefficients were also assessed. S. maritima showed the higher root turnovers and cycling coefficients for most of the analyzed metals, making this a phytostabilizer specie. By contrast the low root turnover, cycling coefficient and low root necromass generation makes S. perennis the most suitable specie for phytoremediation processes. Although the high amounts of metal return to the sediments, due to root senescence, salt marshes can still be considered sinks of heavy metals, cycling heavy metals mostly between sediment and root.

AB  - Salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of North America are characterized by having a high biomass of smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora. Because of the refractory nature of the lignocellulosic structure of this angiosperm, invertebrates utilize C from these plants with very low efficiency, if at all. This is true for both living cordgrass and post-senescent plant detritus. To balance their C demands, invertebrate consumers living in salt marshes must utilize a wide variety of other resources, including microheterotrophs (bacteria and bacterivorous flagellates) either associated with detritus or free in the water column, fungi colonizing decaying vascular plants, surface-associated algae (e.g., microphytobenthic diatoms and cyanobacteria, epiphytes, surface film algae) and phytoplankton. This high degree of trophic complexity is likely to be an important source of community stability. As an example, we estimate that ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, in a Delaware marsh must rely on a variety of different food resources since no single food type can meet their nutritional demands for either C or N. To balance their C demands, mussels appear to rely mainly on microheterotrophs, followed by phytoplankton > microphytobenthos > cellulosic detritus. Non-detrital foods are even more important for maintaining positive N balance in G. demissa. Previous and emerging evidence from other studies suggests that other important marsh consumers have a similar general diet. Although cordgrass may dominate overall rates of primary production and detritus from cordgrass contributes significantly to secondary production, we challenge the paradigm that salt marshes have a "detritus-based food web." Further research is needed to deduce the importance of microphytobenthos and microheterotrophs as sources of C and N for dominant animal consumers in these marsh systems.

AB  - Coastal forested wetlands provide important ecosystem services along the southeastern region of the United States, but are threatened by anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Here, we examined the species composition, mortality, aboveground biomass, and carbon content of vegetation and soils in natural pine forests of the lower coastal plain in eastern North Carolina, USA. We compared a forest clearly in decline (termed "ghost forest") adjacent to a roadside canal that had been installed as drainage for a road next to an adjacent forest subject to "natural" hydrology, unaltered by human modification (termed "healthy forest"). We also assessed how soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation changed over time using C-14 radiocarbon dating of wood sampled at different depths within the peat profile. Our results showed that the ghost forest had a higher tree density at 687 trees ha(-1), and was dominated by swamp bays (Persea palustric), compared to the healthy forest, which had 265 trees ha(-1) dominated by pond pine (Pinus serotina Michx). Overstory tree mortality of the ghost forest was nearly ten times greater than the healthy forest (p < 0.05), which actually contributed to higher total aboveground biomass (55.9 +/- 12.6 Mg C ha(-1) vs. 27.9 +/- 8.7 Mg ha(-1) in healthy forest), as the dead standing tree biomass (snags) added to that of an encroaching woody shrub layer during ecosystem transition. Therefore, the total aboveground C content of the ghost forest, 33.98 +/- 14.8 Mg C ha(-1), was higher than the healthy forest, 24.7 +/- 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) (p < 0.05). The total SOC stock down to a 2.3 m depth in the ghost forest was 824.1 +/- 46.2 Mg C ha(-1), while that of the healthy forest was 749.0 +/- 170.5 Mg C ha(-1) (p > 0.05). Carbon dating of organic sediments indicated that, as the sample age approaches modern times (surface layer year 2015), the organic soil accumulation rate (1.11 to 1.13 mm year(-1)) is unable to keep pace with the estimated rate of recent sea level rise (2.1 to 2.4 mm year(-1)), suggesting a causative relationship with the ecosystem transition occurring at the site. Increasing hydrologic stress over recent decades appears to have been a major driver of ecosystem transition, that is, ghost forest formation and woody shrub encroachment, as indicated by the far higher overstory tree mortality adjacent to the drainage ditch, which allows the inland propagation of hydrologic/salinity forcing due to SLR and extreme storms. Our study documents C accumulation in a coastal wetland over the past two millennia, which is now threatened due to the recent increase in the rate of SLR exceeding the natural peat accumulation rate, causing an ecosystem transition with unknown consequences for the stored C; however, much of it will eventually be returned to the atmosphere. More studies are needed to determine the causes and consequences of coastal ecosystem transition to inform the modeling of future coastal wetland responses to environmental change and the estimation of regional terrestrial C stocks and flux.

AB  - We develop a biomorphodynamic model to investigate sediment and vegetation dynamics on a schematic intertidal flat characterized by an initially well-mixed sand-mud mixture. Major interactions between tides, wind waves, salt marshes, sediment transport and sea level rise (SLR) are taken into account. For a bare flat under only tidal action, the model predicts a convex cross-shore profile with the surficial distribution of mud and sand on the upper and lower part of the intertidal flat, respectively. When wind waves are strong, the intertidal flat is highly eroded resulting in a concave profile near the high water mark. This behavior is pronouncedly altered when the intertidal flat is vegetated with the presence of salt marshes. Numerical results suggest that a considerable amount of mud can still remain in the vegetated region even when wave action is strong. A steeper transition zone forms at the boundary between salt marshes and bare flats because of the differential sediment deposition in the two neighboring regions. The inclusion of wind waves is found to considerably enhance the size of the marsh-edge transition zone. For the numerical experiments designed in this study, the profile shape and sediment sorting behavior of tidal flats are not significantly modified by a gradual rising sea level. However, the impacts of SLR on vegetated tidal flats are still manifold: (a) driving the landward migration of intertidal zone and salt marshes; (b) enhancing sediment erosion on intertidal flats; and (c) drowning salt marshes under limited sediment supply with the constrain of seawalls. Finally, model results suggest that organic carbon accumulation on marshlands may be enhanced with an increasing SLR rate provided that salt marshes are not drowned. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Development of coastal New England has led to the replacement of up to 37% of salt marshes with degraded freshwater wetlands, primarily through tidal restrictions. Removing these restrictions to restore salt marsh ecology would improve water quality, increase flood and storm protection, nutrient filtration, erosion control, and carbon sequestration. However, such restorations replace functional freshwater wetlands and could potentially impact freshwater species. Freshwater-dependent wildlife species such as the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), may be especially vulnerable to rapid changes in habitat resulting from tidal reintroduction due to their high site fidelity and limited ability to disperse quickly. Conservation of genetically and physically isolated spotted turtle populations as well as the restoration of salt marshes to mitigate climate change impacts are both high priorities on Nantucket Island. These two priorities conflicted in a project to restore tidal hydrology to an impounded freshwater marsh known to host a robust spotted turtle population. We evaluated changes to spotted turtle home range size and location and habitat use in response to salt marsh restoration over eight years. Home range size did not change but the location of home ranges shifted into bordering wetlands landward of the tidal salt water influence. Spotted turtles selected remaining freshwater marshes and shrub swamps while avoiding developed land and areas of establishing salt marsh within areas that had previously been high quality habitat. This study suggests prioritizing conservation of wetlands adjacent to planned salt marsh restoration to provide habitat for freshwater species to migrate.

AB  - The response of deposit-feeding animals to plant invasions is still unclear, because their food sources are often difficult to identify. We examined the effect of the exotic plant species, Spartina alterniflora, on the food source composition of two dominant snail species, Assiminea latericea and Cerithidea largillierti, in the Yangtze River estuary salt marsh using a combination of stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. We collected the snails and their potential food materials (sediment organic matter, particulate organic matter, and plant material) in S. alterniflora and native plant Phragmites australis marshes and then determined the composition of food sources of snails based on fatty acid markers and stable isotope composition. Our results indicated that A. latericea and C. largillierti are deposit feeders grazing on sedimentary particles originating from diatoms, bacteria, and vascular plants. Invasive S. alterniflora did not result in a change in the relative contribution of microalgae, bacteria, and vascular plants to the food source of the snails. Spartina alterniflora was confirmed to be assimilated by both snail species. The higher assimilation of S. alterniflora by A. latericea compared with C. largillierti is probably related to the greater ability of A. latericea to assimilate plant materials from detritus, as evidenced by fatty acid composition. Overall, S. alterniflora can be incorporated into the food web of the estuarine salt marsh by the dominant snail species with generalist-feeding habits.

AB  - Now that we are beginning to understand that the balance of nature is a pulsing one and not a steady-state as is the case at the organism level (i.e., homeorhesis rather than homeostasis) estuaries become important sites for research because they pulse so strongly. The external tidal pulses interface in a complex manner with internal biological and life history pulses. I review the concept that productivity of near shore ocean waters can be enhanced not only by upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters but also by outwelling of nutrients and organic matter from fertile estuaries. I conclude 1) that the extent of the latter depends on the level of production within the estuary, the tidal amplitude and the geomorphology of the estuarine landscape and 2) the outwelling from tidal marshes where it occurs is often intermittent and largest during rain storms and storm tides.

AB  - The spread of the invasive native clonal grass Elymus athericus is one of the most significant changes that have affected the plant communities of European salt marshes in the last decade. The goal of this study was to investigate the rate of this invasion and its impact on C cycling in a non-grazed salt marsh of the Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France). Aboveground net primary production (ANPP), litter quantity and quality, and decomposition rates were quantified in Elymus athericus and in the original plant communities ("control"). Since 1991, Elymus athericus has been replacing the characteristic plant communities at a rate of 4 ha yr(-1). ANPP was significantly higher in Elymus athericus (3011 +/- 347 gDW m(-2) yr(-1) and 1181 +/- 1123 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) than in the control (2028 +/- 239 gDW m(-2) yr(-1) and 771 +/- 76 gC m(-2) yr(-1)) stands. Lignin content of Elymus athericus' litter was 3.5 times greater than in the litter of the control communities, explaining its accumulation under the vegetation (i.e., litter quantity was from 2 to 10 times greater under Elymus athericus than under the control vegetation). C mineralization in the sediment (expressed as rate of CO2 per mass of sediment) was significantly lower under Elymus athericus than under the control vegetation. Our results suggest that Elymus athericus increased C trapping within the salt marsh and thus limits the potential for C exportation toward coastal waters.

AB  - To characterise soil humic acids (HAs) extracted from Spanish marshes formed under different vegetation types (Spartina maritima (GSp), Juncus maritimus (GJc), Phragmites australis (GPh), and Scirpus maritimus (VSc)), soil depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm), physiographic position (low and high marshes), wetland types (salt marshes and lagoons) and environmental conditions (Atlantic and Mediterranean coast).
   Soil samples were collected in five Spanish marshes, three on the Galicia province and two on the Valencia province. Humic acids were extracted and their elemental composition, semiquinone-type free radical (SFR) content, FTIR and CPMAS C-13 NMR spectra determined. Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulphur (TS), CaCO3 content, and field pH and Eh (mV) in the marsh soils sampled were also measured.
   The field pH and Eh values were typical of coastal areas submitted to periodic inundations and the highest TC, TN and TS contents were found in the soil of lagoon marshes as an effect of physiographic position and wetland type. The HAs, in general, were highly aliphatic and exhibited a low SFR content, which suggests a low humification degree of the SOM formed in the studied areas. This is a result of the anaerobic decomposition to which SOM is submitted and the high input of plant-derived organic matter (OM) by vegetation. However, among the studied sites low salt marsh and subsurface layer of the high salt marsh showed higher SFR content, simpler FTIR spectra, higher lignin degradation and lower O-alkyl C/alkyl C ratio than the lagoon marshes, thus suggesting the presence of a more humificated SOM in these sites.
   From the different factors analysed, only physiographic position (low versus high salt marshes) and wetland type (marshes versus lagoons) caused variations in the HAs characteristics, because as the studied soils are under anaerobic conditions, they control the exportation of plant-derived OM and the allochthonous OM contribution in the studied areas.

AB  - The construction of sea embankments is an increasingly common approach for controlling the spread of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in coastal wetlands of eastern China. However, the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in salt marshes is not fully understood. In this study, we examined the stocks of the total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, the recalcitrant indices of C and N, and the concentrations of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) in sea embankment-reclaimed S. alterniflora and Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. salt marshes through comparisons with adjacent unreclaimed S. alterniflora and S. salsa salt marshes in a coastal wetland of eastern China. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased plant biomass by 55.34%, soil salinity by 81.71%, soil moisture by 43.16%, soil total organic C by 50.60% and total organic N by 49.99%, and also lowered labile and recalcitrant organic C and N, WSOC, MBC and MINC in the invasive S. alterniflora salt marsh. However, sea embankment reclamation did not significantly affect the stocks of the soil organic total C and N, recalcitrant organic C and N, and soil organic C dynamics in the native S. salsa salt marsh, possibly because the total quantity of S. salsa materials entering the soil, soil salinity, moisture and bulk density were not affected by sea embankment reclamation. Our results suggest that the impact of sea embankment reclamation on soil organic C and N pools is much more profound in S. alterniflora salt marsh than in S. salsa salt marsh. Sea embankment reclamation could greatly weaken the C and N sinks of S. alterniflora salt marsh and potentially affect C and N sinks in the coastal wetlands of eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flooding periods can be one of the most important factors influencing nitrogen (N) biogeochemical processes in wetlands ecosystem. We conducted a field study using in situ incubation method to investigate the seasonal dynamics of soil net N mineralization in three coastal salt marshes (Suaeda salsa) with different flooding periods (i.e., short-term (STF), seasonal (SF), and tidal (TF) flooding wetland) in the Yellow River Delta. Selected soil inorganic N pools (ammonium, nitrate and inorganic N) and N transformation (mineralization, nitrification and ammonification) rates in the top 0-10 cm soils were repeatedly quantified from April to October. Clear seasonal patterns in inorganic N pools and transformation rates were observed in accord with the seasonal variations of temperature and moisture. Generally, higher levels of soil inorganic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) occurred in the early-growing season (April), and NH4+-N contents got a small accumulative peak in midsummer (September). The lower rates (negative) of net mineralization (R-min), nitrification (R-nit) and ammonification (R-amm) were observed in the early-growing season (April-June) and fall (September-October), whereas higher values (positive) in midsummer (August-September). Flooding had a significant influence on inorganic N pools (except for NH4+-N) and transformation rates (p < 0.05). R-min values in SF wetland were significantly higher in the August-September period than those in other incubation periods R-nit values in TF wetland exhibited a small variation and the highest value occured in the June-August period. The results of principal component analysis showed that soil samples were clearly divided into two groups before and after flow-sediment regulation. After flooding events, the R-mm and R-amm values generally increased in the three wetlands, whereas a significant decrease in R-nit values was observed in SF wetland (p < 0.05), thus the differences in NO3--N among these wetlands were eliminated. These results suggested that seasonal variations in temperature and moisture are important factors influencing inorganic N pools and transformation rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mangrove forest stores large organic carbon stocks in a setting that is highly vulnerable to climate change and direct anthropogenic influences. As such there is a need to elucidate the causes and consequences of land use change on these ecosystems that have high value in terms of ecosystem services. We examine the areal pattern of land types in a coastal region located in southern Iran over a period of 14 years to predict future loss and gain in land types to the year 2025. We applied a CA-Markov model to simulate and predict mangrove forest change. Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2014 were used to analyze the land cover changes between soil, open water and mangroves. Major changes during this period were observed in soil and water which could be attributed to rising sea level. Furthermore, the mangrove area in the more seaward position was converted to open water due to sea-level rise. A cellular automata model was then used to predict the land cover changes that would occur by the year 2025. Results demonstrated that approximately 21 ha of mangrove area will be converted to open water, while mangroves are projected to expand by approximately 28 ha in landward direction. These changes need to be delineated to better inform precise mitigation and adaptation measures.

AB  - To assess attributes of algal assemblages as indicators of salt marsh restoration, we chose eight pairs of salt marshes in North Carolina, USA, each pair with one restored marsh (from I to 28 years old) and a nearby existing salt marsh. Algae on both Spartina alterniflora and sediments (sediment algae) were collected in each marsh during spring and summer 1998 for assaying algal biomass (dry mass (DM), ash free dry mass (AFDM), chl a content, algal biovolume), algal species composition and diversity, and gross primary production. An attribute restoration ratio was calculated by dividing attribute values from each restored marsh by values from a paired reference marsh. Controlling for regional variation in reference marshes substantially increased precision in relations between attributes and the increase in age of restored marshes. The organic matter restoration ratio of sediments increased with age of restored marshes in both spring and summer. The algal biomass restoration ratios of epiphytes, calculated with algal biovolume and chl a, increased with restored marsh age in summer but not during spring. Biomass of sediment algae was not related to marsh age. The species diversity of sediment algae in summer showed an asymptotic relationship with sediment nutrient concentration. The similarity of diatom species composition between paired restored and reference sites increased with age of restored marshes during spring and summer. Primary production by epiphytic and sediment algae in summer showed site-specific changes and did not change consistently with marsh age. Algal biomass, algal diversity, and diatom species composition during summer were positively correlated with sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentration. We concluded that other structural and functional development of restored wetlands, especially nutrient storage in sediments, regulates algal species composition and algal biomass accumulation, which can be used to evaluate salt marsh restoration.

AB  - We evaluated the biogeomorphic processes of a large (309 ha) tidal salt marsh and examined factors that influence its ability to keep pace with relative sea-level rise (SLR). Detailed elevation data from 1995 and 2008 were compared with digital elevation models (DEMs) to assess marsh surface elevation change during this time. Overall, 37 % (113 ha) of the marsh increased in elevation at a rate that exceeded SLR, whereas 63 % (196 ha) of the area did not keep pace with SLR. Of the total area, 55 % (169 ha) subsided during the study period, but subsidence varied spatially across the marsh surface. To determine which biogeomorphic and spatial factors contributed to measured elevation change, we collected soil cores and determined percent and origin of organic matter (OM), particle size, bulk density (BD), and distance to nearest bay edge, levee, and channel. We then used Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) model selection to assess those variables most important to determine measured elevation change. Soil stable isotope compositions were evaluated to assess the source of the OM. The samples had limited percent OM by weight (< 5.5 %), with mean bulk densities of 0.58 g cm(-3), indicating that the soils had high mineral content with a relatively low proportion of pore space. The most parsimonious model with the highest AICc weight (0.53) included distance from bay's edge (i.e., lower intertidal) and distance from levee (i.e., upper intertidal). Close proximity to sediment source was the greatest factor in determining whether an area increased in elevation, whereas areas near landward levees experienced subsidence. Our study indicated that the ability of a marsh to keep pace with SLR varied across the surface, and assessing changes in elevation over time provides an alternative method to long-term accretion monitoring. SLR models that do not consider spatial variability of biogeomorphic and accretion processes may not correctly forecast marsh drowning rates, which may be especially true in modified and urbanized estuaries. In light of SLR, improving our understanding of elevation change in these dynamic marsh systems will play a crucial role in forecasting potential impacts to their sustainability and the survival of these ecosystems.

AB  - Sediment microbial communities are responsible for several ecosystem key-processes such as decomposition. However, these communities depend on aerobic respiration making them a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Since sediments are a known important carbon sink, it becomes important to address the factors that modulate sediment respiration and therefore CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. Therefore, the present work aimed to assess the main factors controlling sediment respiratory activity in salt marshes. Sediment respiration and several sediment abiotic characteristics were assessed in two salt marshes from Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon with contrasting environmental conditions. Sediment respiration had significant differences across seasons and salt marshes, and different patterns of activity were found for each salt marsh. Statistical analysis and modelling by Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that sediment respiration is mostly influenced by organic matter quality (C:N ratio), sediment temperature and sediment pH. Nevertheless, as temperature appeared to be one of the most important factors influencing CO2 effluxes from the sediments, its influence during possible global warming scenarios was focused. The simulations produced by the GLM using the IPCC scenarios projections, indicated that salt marshes will tend do decrease their CO2 emissions with the increasing temperatures, reinforcing their role as important carbon sinks. This can be interpreted as an ecosystemic counteract measure toward a reduction of the increasing temperature by reducing the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, namely CO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding wetland food webs is critical for effective habitat management, restoration and conservation. Microalgae are recognized as key food sources for marsh invertebrates but the importance of different groups under various conditions is rarely examined. We tested the hypothesis that faunal utilization of microalgae, and cyanobacteria in particular, is significant in Southern California created and natural salt marshes but varies with habitat type (creek bank versus marsh interior) and season (spring versus autumn). We used stable isotope analysis and mixing models (IsoSource) to compare food webs in adjacent young (created) and mature (natural) salt marshes. Isotopic values of some primary producers, macrofauna, epifauna, and fish demonstrated significant differences between the adjacent salt marshes. delta C-13 and delta S-34 values of the benthic microalgal community varied with taxonomic composition (diatoms versus cyanobacteria) and to a lesser extent with season. Depleted delta N-15 values of benthic diatoms and macroalgae indicated that N-2 fixed within algal mats was recycled within the benthic algal community. Marsh fauna, including most major macrofauna taxal, Cerithidea, and Fundulus, also exhibited seasonal differences in isotopic composition, and Cerithidea and selected macrofauna (oligochaetes, polychaetes) from the marsh interior were more enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15 than those from the creek bank. In the young marsh, the cyanobacteria contributed a minimum of 17-100% of the primary production in food webs supporting macrofauna, and cyanobacteria contributed at least 40% of the primary production included in Cerithidea and Fundulus food webs. A wider range of primary producers contributed to food webs in the mature marsh. Cyanobacteria were a greater source of trophic support for macrofauna from the marsh interior than the creek bank, whereas Spartina was a more important food source for creek bank macrofauna in both marshes. Insect larvae largely consumed cyanobacteria, whereas polychaetes exhibited greater utilization of Spartina. Phytoplankton was the primary food resource for mussels in both marshes. Although the spatial and temporal complexity of food webs has traditionally been collapsed into the study of relatively simplified food webs, isotope signatures reveal fine-scale patterns in food web structure that may be used to make more accurate assessments of ecosystem state. Accurate interpretation of marsh trophic structure using natural abundance stable isotopes requires fine-scale resolution in space and time, a large number of samples, and a high level of taxonomic resolution.

AB  - Surface sediments and three sediment vibrocores were collected from the salt marsh of the Yangtze Estuary in order to examine the C, N, P and S distributions. Marsh plants and Suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the river were also sampled and analyzed in order to determine their elemental compositions. The levels of total organic carbon (0.1-0.7%) and ON ratios (6-11) in the surface sediments of the Yangtze Estuary salt marsh were relatively low compared with those reported for other salt marshes in European and North American coastal areas. The total organic carbon (TOC) level and C/N ratio of the surface sediments were similar to those of the SPM in the Yangtze Estuary, but were much lower than those of the marsh plant samples. These findings support the view that organic matter in the surface sediments is largely derived from SPM in the river, with minor contributions from the marsh vegetation. Total phosphorus (TP) showed irregular variation in its spatial distribution, whereas the TOC, total nitrogen JN) and total sulfur (TS) concentrations were highest in the high marsh zones and lowest in the bare flat areas. This pattern was related to the spatial variability of the sediment grain size (i.e. clay-rich sediments in the high marsh zones resulted in elevated TOC, TN and TS contents). Some vibrocore sediments in the mid-depths of the high and low marsh zones, however, showed greater TOC contents than might have been predicted from the TOC-gram size relationship. This Suggested the existence of additional organic inputs (i.e. marsh vegetation) for these vibrocore sediment sections, despite their original riverine source. After eliminating the effect of grain size, it was calculated that 22-55% of the TOC and 0.6-35% of the TN in the sediment samples were derived from the marsh vegetation. Considering both the vertical accretion rate and the ecosystem evolution of the salt marsh, it was estimated that the annual contributions Of TOC and TN made by the marsh vegetation to the sediments in the Yangtze Estuary were 5.8 x 101 1 g C yr(-1) and 2.3 x 10(10)) g N yr(-1), respectively, with corresponding accumulation rate; of 1.1-1.5 x 10(10) g C yr(-1) and 4.4-5.8 x 10(10) g N yr(-1) at the present time.

AB  - Coastal marshes are an important component of the global carbon cycle, yet our understanding of how these ecosystems will respond to sea level rise (SLR) is limited. Coastal marsh hydrology varies based on elevation, distance from channel, and hydraulic properties, resulting in zones of unique water level oscillation patterns. These zones impact ecology and geochemistry and correspond to differences in carbon accumulation rates. These physical-biogeochemical linkages enable use of a hydrological model to predict changes in marsh zonation, and in turn carbon accumulation, as well as groundwater-surface water exchange under SLR. Here, we developed a calibrated hydrological model of a Delaware coastal marsh using HydroGeoSphere. We simulated three scenarios each of SLR, sediment accretion, and upland hydrologic response, and we quantified changes in the spatial coverage of different hydrologic zonations and groundwater-surface water exchange. Results show that relative SLR reduces marsh area, carbon burial, and lateral water fluxes. However, the magnitudes of change are linked to the terrestrial groundwater table response as well as relative SLR. In scenarios where the upland water table does not change with SLR, the magnitude of decline in marsh area and carbon accumulation is reduced compared to scenarios where the upland water table keeps pace with SLR. In contrast, the reduction in lateral water flux is minimized in scenarios with an upland water table rise equal to SLR compared to scenarios where the upland water table is held at present-day levels. This study highlights the importance of regional hydrologic setting in the fate of coastal marsh dynamics.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal marshes are efficient carbon sinks, but their location at the land-sea interface makes them vulnerable to sea level rise. Through a web of complex interactions, coastal marsh hydrology, which is spatially variable, impacts carbon burial. This link between ecosystem processes enables the use of a physical, hydrological model to forecast changes in hydrology under variable relative sea level rise scenarios that can be related to alterations in carbon accumulation across the marsh. Our results show that both sea level and the water table on land impact coastal marsh hydrology. Results show a decrease in marsh area and carbon sequestration capacity with sea level rise, and variations in relative sea level rise and groundwater table response to climate change impact the magnitude of these effects.

AB  - A 3.1 m sediment core was analyzed for stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter and higher plant leaf wax (HPLW) lipid biomarkers to determine Holocene shifts in C-3 (higher high marsh) and C-4 (low and/or high marsh) plant deposition at the Sprague River Salt Marsh, Phippsburg, Maine. The carbon isotope composition of the bulk sediment and the HPLW parallel each other throughout most of the core, suggesting that terrestrial plants are an important source of organic matter to the sediments, and diagenetic alteration of the bulk sediments is minimal. The current salt marsh began to form 2500 cal yr BP. Low and/or high C-4 marsh plants dominated deposition at 2000 cal yr BP, 700 cal yr BP, and for the last 200 cal yr BP. Expansion of higher high marsh C-3 plants occurred at 1300 and 600 cal yr BP. These major vegetation shifts result from a combination of changes in relative sea-level rise and sediment accumulation rates.
   Average annual carbon sequestration rates for the last 2500 years approximate 40 g C yr(-1) m(-2), and are in strong agreement with other values published for the Gulf of Maine. Given that Maine salt marshes cover an area of similar to 79 km, they represent an important component of the terrestrial carbon sink. More detailed isotopic and age records from a network of sediment cores at Sprague Marsh are needed to truly evaluate the long term changes in salt marsh plant communities and the impact of more recent human activity, including global warming, on salt marsh vegetation.

AB  - Bacterial decomposition of vascular plant detritus in coastal wetlands results in the conversion of particulate organic matter to dissolved form and causes the release of humic substances into the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. We found that 34% of the DOC accumulating during degradation of salt marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) from coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S. fits the definition of humic substances and that lignin is the primary source of the dissolved humic substances (66% of the total). Although marine bacterioplankton used the lignin-rich humic substances more slowly and less efficiently than other components of the DOC pool. a significant fraction (24%) of these substances was mineralized within 7 weeks. Concentrations of vascular plant biomarkers (lignin phenols) indicate that 11-75% of the dissolved humic substances on the southeastern U.S. continental shelf is from vascular plant-dominated environments, Calculations indicate that about half this material is contributed by the coastal salt marshes and half by river export. Vascular plant influence was lower in the bulk DOC pool (2-38%). indicating that terrestrially derived material is harbored preferentially in the humic substances subcomponent of marine DOC.

AB  - Freshwater input for salt marsh restoration in the Yellow River Delta induced Phragmites australis expansion and thus may cause shifts of soil fungi from halophilic to desalination-adapted species for increased litter decomposition. In this study, soil fungal communities of restored and natural salt marshes were determined to reveal further details of shift in soil fungal community and its probable prediction for salt marsh restoration. Our results showed a stronger network within Ascomycota (e.g. Sordariales, Aspergillus, llypocreales and Cladosporium herbarum) in restored marshes, but with a lower diversity of halophilic taxa (e.g. Chyttidiomycota and Nematoda) in comparison with natural salt marshes. Contrarily, the occurrence of Chytridiomycota, lchthyosporea and Discicristoidea in the soil fungal networks of the natural salt marsh emphasized the importance of salt tolerant species at the land-sea transition zone. The Sordariales was dominant and had a strong correlation with other fungal species and aggregate associated soil organic carbon (SOC), which probably contributed to SOC accumulation in restored marshes. But the reduced halophilic species specific to salt marsh elucidated that the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis along with the freshwater input induced desalination to the saline habitats changed the native patterns of vegetation and soil organisms. As the buffer between terrestrial and marine systems, a single habitat type such as dense monocultures of P. australis must be avoided and diverse saltmarsh habitats across a salinity gradient should be reserved. In this way, the diversity and specificity of coastal halophytes and related microorganisms could be maintained and thus might confer benefits in balancing various functions of the salt marsh ecosystem and preserving the system's elasticity and resistance to stress.

AB  - We explore the dynamics of the subsurface sulfur, iron and carbon cycles in salt marsh sediments from East Anglia, United Kingdom. We report measurements of pore fluid and sediment geochemistry, coupled with results from laboratory sediment incubation experiments, and develop a conceptual model to describe the influence of bioturbation on subsurface redox cycling. In the studied sediments the subsurface environment falls into two broadly defined geochemical patterns - iron-rich sediments or sulfide-rich sediments. Within each sediment type nearly identical pore fluid and solid phase geochemistry (in terms of concentrations of iron, sulfate, sulfide, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate) are observed in sediments that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Strictly iron-rich and strictly sulfide-rich sediments, despite their substantive geochemical differences, are observed within spatial distances of less than five meters. We suggest that this bistable system results from a series of feedback reactions that determine ultimately whether sediments will be sulfide-rich or iron-rich. We suggest that an oxidative cycle in the iron-rich sediment, driven by bioirrigation, allows rapid oxidation of organic matter, and that this irrigation impacts the sediment below the immediate physical depth of bioturbation. This oxidative cycle yields iron-rich sediments with low total organic carbon, dominated by microbial iron reduction and no methane production. In the absence of bioirrigation, sediments in the salt marsh become sulfide-rich with high methane concentrations. Our results suggest that the impact of bioirrigation not only drives recycling of sedimentary material but plays a key role in sedimentary interactions among iron, sulfur and carbon.

AB  - Degradation of lignin-related aromatic compounds is an important ecological process in the highly productive salt marshes of the southeastern United States, yet little is known about the mediating organisms or their catabolic pathways. Here we report the diversity of a gene encoding a key ring-cleaving enzyme of the beta -ketoadipate pathway, pcaH, amplified from bacterial communities associated with decaying Spartina alterniflora, the salt marsh grass that dominates these coastal systems, as well as from enrichment cultures with aromatic substrates (p-hydroxybenzoate, anthranilate, vanillate, and dehydroabietate). Sequence analysis of 149 pcaH clones revealed 85 unique sequences. Thirteen of the 53 amino acid residues compared were invariant in the PcaH proteins, suggesting that these residues have a required catalytic or structural function. Fifty-eight percent of the clones matched sequences amplified from a collection of 36 bacterial isolates obtained from seawater, marine sediments, or senescent Spartina. Fifty-two percent of the pcaH clones could be assigned to the roseobacter group, a marine lineage of the class alpha -Proteobacteria abundant in coastal ecosystems. Another 6% of the clones matched genes retrieved from isolates belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Stappia, and 42% of the clones could not be assigned to a cultured bacterium based on sequence identity. These results suggest that the diversity of the genes encoding a single step in aromatic compound degradation in the coastal marsh examined is high.

AB  - New England high salt marsh primary productivity is limited by N, but variation in plant N availability across salt marsh vegetation zones has not been quantified. To investigate this, we measured in situ net N mineralization rates throughout the growing season in three zones of a Maine high salt marsh, Juncus gerardii, Spartina patens, and mixed perennial forb. We also measured microclimate factors ( soil temperatures and moistures) and substrate quality parameters ( soil organic matter, soil total nitrogen, soil C: N ratio) to see if either related to differences in net N mineralization. To determine the relative importance of substrate quality and microclimate, we measured N mineralization of the different soil types in the laboratory, holding microclimate parameters constant. We also investigated the relative importance of microclimate and substrate statistically, with principal components analysis and multiple regression. In situ net N mineralization rates were significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but graminoid zone N mineralization rates did not vary significantly from each other. Soil temperatures, moistures, carbon, and nitrogen were all significantly higher in the forb zone than in graminoid zones, but C: N ratio did not vary significantly across zones. Principal components analysis and multiple regression revealed that microclimate was a more significant predictor of total N mineralized over the course of the growing season than was substrate quality. In contrast, when microclimate conditions were held constant, forb zone N mineralization was still significantly higher than that of graminoid zones, suggesting that substrate quality does exert some control on this process. Thus, both microclimate and substrate quality appear to influence N mineralization rates across vegetation zones of this Maine salt marsh.

AB  - The Mississippi River deltaic plain (MRDP) coastal wetlands are one of the largest in the United States. Adequate characterization of labile organic C (LOC) is essential for understanding the C transformation and overall biogeochemistry in these wetland soils. Among different MRDP wetlands, freshwater and brackish marsh soils contain higher LOC than saline marsh and forest swamp soils. Labile organic C estimated by aerobic incubation and salt and cold water extractions is generally less than 0.5% of soil organic C (SOC), whereas hot water extraction and especially acid hydrolysis yield 1.2 to 3.49% and 12.8 to 43% of SOC, respectively. Carboxyl C was the primary component of LOC by cold water and salt extractions, whereas both carboxyl C and O/N-alkyl C were released by aerobic mineralization. On the other hand, LOC by hot water extraction contains mainly carbonyl C, whereas acid hydrolysis includes the contribution of alkyl C besides O/N-alkyl C. In addition, higher LOC in freshwater marsh soils than in saline and forest swamp soils facilitates higher denitrification potential of the former, which is negatively correlated with the presence of phenolic aldehydes and ketones in these wetland soils. The addition of clay sediments reduce LOC degradation as is evident by lowered CO2 emissions. Monovalent K+ holds more DOC in forest swamp soils, whereas divalent Ca2+ retains more DOC in marsh soils. Selective degradation of syringyl lignin structure over guaiacyl occurs in both dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bulk soil organic matter (SOM) in the MRDP wetlands, which could enhance overall SOC lability and potentially contribute to the northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxia if exported offshore.

AB  - Photosynthetic carbon is an integral part of carbon cycle in plant-soil system, also is an important source of soil organic carbon. In this study, C-13 labeling was used for exploring allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in Phragmites australis -soil system undergoing the salt marsh restoration project by freshwater pumping in Yellow River Estuary (YRE), China. Samples were collected from T-0 (before labeling) to 90 days after labeling (T-4), in natural salt marsh, 5-, 10- and 15-year freshwater pumping areas, respectively. The photosynthate-C-13 contents of soil were gradually decreased to 0 mg/g at T-4 in most areas, while it was 2.21 mg/g in 15-year pumping area, higher than other areas at the last sampling time (T-4). And the allocation of photosynthate-C-13 in soil was increased from 3.58% at T-2 to 44.46% at T-3 in natural salt marsh, while no significant change was found in other areas from T-2 to T-3, followed by the significantly higher photosynthate-C-13 proportion in soils of 15-year pumping area at T-4. EC (R-2 = 0.5972) and small macro-aggregates proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.4829) had positive correlations with A photosynthate-C-13 (the value of photosynthate-C-13 in underground part minus that in soil); silt and clay fractions proportion of soil (R-2 = 0.7044) had negative correlation with Delta photosynthate-C-13. Distribution and transportation of photosynthetic carbon in the underground were affected by soil physical and chemical properties.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes sequester carbon at high rates relative to other ecosystems and emit relatively little methane particularly compared to freshwater wetlands. However, fluxes of all major greenhouse gases (N2O, CH4,and CO2) need to be quantified for accurate assessment of the climatic roles of these ecosystems. Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (via run-off, atmospheric deposition, and wastewater) impact coastal marshes. To test the hypothesis that a pulse of nitrogen loading may increase greenhouse gas emissions from salt marsh sediments, we compared N2O, CH4 and respiratory CO2 fluxes from nitrate-enriched plots in a Spartina patens marsh (receiving single additions of NaNO3 equivalent to 1.4 g N m(-2)) to those from control plots (receiving only artificial seawater solutions) in three short-term experiments (July 2009, April 2010, and June 2010). In July 2009, we also compared N2O and CH4 fluxes in both opaque and transparent chambers to test the influence of light on gas flux measurements. Background fluxes of N2O in July 2009 averaged -33 mu mol N2O m(-2) day(-1). However, within 1 h of nutrient additions, N2O fluxes were significantly greater in plots receiving nitrate additions relative to controls in July 2009. Respiratory rates and CH4 fluxes were not significantly affected. N2O fluxes were significantly higher in dark than in transparent chambers, averaging 108 and 42 mu mol N2O m(-2) day(-1) respectively. After 2 days, when nutrient concentrations returned to background levels, none of the greenhouse gas fluxes differed from controls. In April 2010, N2O and CH4 fluxes were not significantly affected by nitrate, possibly due to higher nitrogen demands by growing S. patens plants, but in June 2010 trends of higher N2O fluxes were again found among nitrate-enriched plots, indicating that responses to nutrient pulses may be strongest during the summer. In terms of carbon equivalents, the highest average N2O and CH4 fluxes observed, exceeded half the magnitude of typical daily net carbon sequestration rates by salt marshes. Thus, anthropogenic additions of nitrate to coasts can substantially alter N2O fluxes from marshes, although substantial temporal variation in these fluxes was observed. To better assess the climatic roles of salt marshes, greenhouse gas emissions need to be studied in the context of chronic nitrogen loads that impact many coastal ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mangroves are species of halophytic intertidal trees and shrubs derived from tropical genera and are likely delimited in latitudinal range by varying sensitivity to cold. There is now sufficient evidence that mangrove species have proliferated at or near their poleward limits on at least five continents over the past half century, at the expense of salt marsh. Avicennia is the most cold-tolerant genus worldwide, and is the subject of most of the observed changes. Avicennia germinans has extended in range along the USA Atlantic coast and expanded into salt marsh as a consequence of lower frost frequency and intensity in the southern USA. The genus has also expanded into salt marsh at its southern limit in Peru, and on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Mangroves of several species have expanded in extent and replaced salt marsh where protected within mangrove reserves in Guangdong Province, China. In south-eastern Australia, the expansion of Avicennia marina into salt marshes is now well documented, and Rhizophora stylosa has extended its range southward, while showing strong population growth within estuaries along its southern limits in northern New South Wales. Avicennia marina has extended its range southwards in South Africa. The changes are consistent with the poleward extension of temperature thresholds coincident with sea-level rise, although the specific mechanism of range extension might be complicated by limitations on dispersal or other factors. The shift from salt marsh to mangrove dominance on subtropical and temperate shorelines has important implications for ecological structure, function, and global change adaptation.

AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats can be important sinks of organic carbon (C-org) and mitigate global warming by sequestering significant quantities of atmospheric CO2 and storing sedimentary Corg for long periods, although their Corg burial and storage capacity may be affected by on-going sea level rise and human intervention. Geochemical data from published Pb-210-dated sediment cores, collected from low-energy microtidal coastal wetlands in El Salvador (Jiquilisco Bay) and in Mexico (Salada Lagoon; Estero de Urias Lagoon; Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve) were revisited to assess temporal changes (within the last 100 years) of Corg concentrations, storage and burial rates in tropical salt marshes under the influence of sea level rise and contrasting anthropization degree. Grain size distribution was used to identify hydrodynamic changes, and delta C-13 to distinguish terrigenous sediments from those accumulated under the influence of marine transgression. Although the accretion rate ranges in all sediment records were comparable, Corg concentrations (0.2-30%), stocks (30465 Mg ha(-1), by extrapolation to 1 m depth), and burial rates (3-378 g m(-2) year(-1)) varied widely within and among the study areas. However, in most sites sea level rise decreased C-org concentrations and stocks in sediments, but increased C-org burial rates. Lower C-org concentrations were attributed to the input of reworked marine particles, which contribute with a lower amount of C-org than terrigenous sediments; whereas higher C-org burial rates were driven by higher mass accumulation rates, influenced by increased flooding and human interventions in the surroundings. C-org accumulation and long-term preservation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangrove or temperate salt marsh areas and, besides the reduction of C-org stocks by ongoing sea level rise, the disturbance of the long-term buried C-org inventories might cause high CO2 releases, for which they must be protected as a part of climate change mitigation efforts.

AB  - Tidal marshes (including saltmarshes) provide remarkable value for many social (cultural, recreational) and environmental (fish production, water quality, shoreline protection, carbon sequestration) services. However, their extent, condition, and capacity to support these services are threatened by human development expansion, invasive species, erosion, altered hydrology and connectivity, and climate change. The past two decades have seen a shift toward working with managers to restore tidal marshes to conserve existing patches or create new marshes. The present perspective examines key features of recent tidal marsh restoration projects. Although optimism about restoration is building, not all marshes are the same; site-specific nuances require careful consideration, and thus, standard restoration designs are not possible. Restoration projects are effectively experiments, requiring clear goals, monitoring and evaluation, and adaptive management practices. Restoration is expensive; however, payment schemes for ecosystem services derived from restoration offer new ways to fund projects and appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs. All information generated by restoration needs to be published and easily accessible, especially failed attempts, to equip practitioners and scientists with actionable knowledge for future efforts. We advocate the need for a network of tidal marsh scientists, managers, and practitioners to share and disseminate new observations and knowledge. Such a network will help augment our capacity to restore tidal marsh, but also valuable coastal ecosystems more broadly.

AB  - Question: To what extent is restoration of vegetation in coastal grasslands delayed by accumulation of nutrients after abandonment of traditional management and subsequent reed encroachment? How does nutrient flow in the plant-soil system react to reintroduction of grazing?
   Location: Coast of Baltic Sea, western Estonia.
   Methods: Abandoned, continuously managed and restored coastal meadows were selected in four different study regions and their vegetation composition sampled. Nitrogen, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg concentrations and C/N ratios were determined in both vegetation and soil. Differences between management groups were evaluated.
   Results: Comparison among different management groups revealed several differences in both relative and total amount of nutrients in soil and vegetation. Most soil properties of restored sites were similar to those in abandoned sites. Carbon stock in the soil profile doubled after abandonment, total N concentration in the top soil layer increased while plant available P concentration decreased. The phytomass and chemical composition of phytomass rapidly changed back to a 'normal' level after restoration. Species composition remained different, but species typical of coastal grasslands were present in restored sites. There was a strong site specificity in the results.
   Conclusions: Re-establishment of grazing had a rapid impact on plant biomass of coastal grasslands. Species composition responded more slowly, but target species returned relatively quickly. Slow recovery of soil properties, however, means that the results of restoration may be fragile and return of tall-growth vegetation is very probable if managent intensity declines. Long restoration periods should be planned to reach pre-abandonment environmental conditions when using non-destructive restoration methods.

AB  - We have shown earlier that fresh and dead tissues of Spartina alterniflora, a plant species dominating Atlantic and Gulf coast salt-marshes, contain humic substances that may be released into sea water and sediment and that resemble sedimentary humic acids. In this study we found that the salt-marsh sediment-related microflora is capable of employing these humic substances under aerobic or semi-anaerobic conditions both as a supplemental source of nutrients and as the sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. Depending on cultivation conditions and type of humic substances, between 27 and 100% of the added humic acids were used. Humic acids recovered from aerobic cultures exhibited elemental and structural changes that are characteristic of diagenetic transformations of sedimentary humic substances, i.e. increase in carbon content, C:H and C:N ratios, optical density and infra-red absorption typical for aromatics. A decrease was found in oxygen content and infra-red absorption associated with proteinaceous and carbohydrate-like components of these substances. Under semi-anaerobic conditions different changes in elemental and structural characteristics of humic acids were observed.

AB  - Plant invasions of coastal wetlands are rapidly changing the structure and function of these systems globally. Alteration of litter dynamics represents one of the fundamental impacts of an invasive plant on salt marsh ecosystems. Tamarisk species (Tamarix spp.), which extensively invade terrestrial and riparian habitats, have been demonstrated to enter food webs in these ecosystems. However, the trophic impacts of the relatively new invasion of tamarisk into marine ecosystem have not been assessed. We evaluated the trophic consequences of invasion by tamarisk for detrital food chains in the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve salt marsh using litter dynamics techniques and stable isotope enrichment experiments. The observations of a short residence time for tamarisk combined with relatively low C:N values indicate that tamarisk is a relatively available and labile food source. With an isotopic (N-15) enrichment of tamarisk, we demonstrated that numerous macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trophic groups, both within and on the sediment, utilized N-15 derived from labeled tamarisk detritus. Infaunal invertebrate species that took up no or limited N-15 from labeled tamarisk (A. californica, enchytraeid oligochaetes, coleoptera larvae) occurred in lower abundance in the tamarisk-invaded environment. In contrast, species that utilized significant N-15 from the labeled tamarisk, such as psychodid insects, an exotic amphipod, and an oniscid isopod, either did not change or occurred in higher abundance. Our research supports the hypothesis that invasive species can alter the trophic structure of an environment through addition of detritus and can also potentially impact higher trophic levels by shifting dominance within the invertebrate community to species not widely consumed.

AB  - Tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows are important global carbon (C) sinks, commonly referred to as coastal "blue carbon". However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30 cm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30 cm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30 cm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30 cm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46% of the variability in 30 cm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million Mg C stored in the top 30 cm of sediments in coastal blue C ecosystems in Victoria, 88% of which was contained within four major coastal areas due to the extent of blue C ecosystems (similar to 87% of total blue C ecosystem area). Regionally, these data can inform conservation management, paired with assessment of other ecosystem services, by enabling identification of hotspots for protection and key locations for restoration efforts. We recommend these methods be tested for applicability to other regions of the globe for identifying drivers of sediment C stock variability and producing predictive C stock models at scales relevant for resource management.

AB  - The trophic importance of microphytobenthos (MPB), phytoplankton, C-3 vascular plants and invasive Spartina alterniflora in benthic and pelagic food webs was studied in Jiuduansha, a newly formed salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, using natural stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses and IsoSource evaluation. MPB was found to be the major food source of meiofauna and important in the diets of macrofaunal consumers. Carbon derived from C-3 vascular plants significantly contributed to the nutrition of all planktonic copepods and supported planktivorous nekton, but played a minor role in the benthic food web. Although phytoplankton could be utilized by all the consumers, low production in this highly turbid estuary might restrict its relative importance. High trophic-level consumers could get carbon from C-13-enriched MPB and C-13-depleted C-3 plants via zoobenthos and zooplankton, respectively. Neither benthic nor pelagic animals fed exclusively on S. alterniflora except for a gastropod species in the present study, indicating a minor contribution of this invasive C-4 plant to the food web of the Jiuduansha salt marsh. In light of the degradation of salt marshes in the Yangtze River estuary, the rapid expansion of this invasive C-4 plant may alter the nutrient foundation of resident and migratory consumers and thus significantly impact the ecosystem there.

AB  - With the degradation or loss of coastal wetlands, more and more restoration projects have been widely conducted. Freshwater inputs have been proved to be an effective restoration way for degraded coastal wetlands. However, little information is available on the changes in soil quality caused by freshwater inputs. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 50 cm in freshwater restoration wetlands (FRW), tidal salt marshes with Suaeda salsa (SSM) and tidal salt marshes with Tamarix chinensis (TSM) in the Yellow River Delta, China, in August 2015, to investigate the changes in soil quality after freshwater inputs. Our results showed that soil salinity was significantly higher in natural wetlands than that in freshwater restoration wetlands (p < 0.05), while no significant differences in soil organic matter (SOM) were observed among three wetlands (p > 0.05). Cluster analysis and principal component analysis exhibited that soil samples in natural wetlands and freshwater restoration wetlands were clearly distinguished. Soil properties were screened and transformed to establish a soil quality index (SQI) for the assessment of soil quality. Soil salinity, SOM and silt were selected in the minimum data set in this study. Although there were no statistical differences in SQIs (p > 0.05), both linear SQI (SQI(L)) and non-linear SQI (SQI(NL)) for three wetlands followed the order: SSM > FRW > TSM. And the SQI(L) values were lower compared with SQI(NL). The contributions of soil salinity to SQI(L) for three wetlands and SQI(NL) for TSM and SSM were the highest in the minimum data for three wetlands, while SOM showed the highest contribution proportion of SQI(NL) for FRW.

AB  - The term 'Blue Carbon' was coined about a decade ago to highlight the important carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated ecosystems. The term has paved the way for the development of programs and policies that preserve and restore these threatened coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation. Blue carbon research has focused on quantifying carbon stocks and burial rates in sediments or accumulating as biomass. This focus on habitat-bound carbon led us to losing sight of the mobile blue carbon fraction. Oceans, the largest active reservoir of carbon, have become somewhat of a blind spot. Multiple recent investigations have revealed high outwelling (i.e., lateral fluxes or horizontal exports) of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon, as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) from blue carbon habitats. In this paper, we conceptualize outwelling in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass and macroalgae ecosystems, diagnose key challenges preventing robust quantification, and pave the way for future work integrating mobile carbon in the blue carbon framework. Outwelling in mangroves and saltmarshes is usually dominated by DIC (mostly as bicarbonate), while POC seems to be the major carbon species exported from seagrass meadows and macroalgae forests. Carbon outwelling science is still in its infancy, and estimates remain limited spatially and temporally. Nevertheless, the existing datasets imply that carbon outwelling followed by ocean storage is relevant and may exceed local sediment burial as a long-term (>centuries) blue carbon sequestration mechanism. If this proves correct as more data emerge, ignoring carbon outwelling may underestimate the perceived sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems whose trophic function can be monitored with stable isotopes of abundant fish biosentinel species such as the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus and the Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia. We compared movement patterns and feeding biology of these species in the summers of 1999 and 2000 in the Rowley River salt marsh estuary north of Boston, Massachusetts, USA. A N-15 tracer addition experiment showed that fish of both species were more resident than transient, with mummichogs resident at scales of 1 km or less. Natural abundance stable isotope C, N, and S distributions showed that mummichogs feed more strongly in the benthic food web while silversides feed more in the planktonic food web, with % benthic feeding respectively averaging 58 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 3 % (mean +/- 95 % confidence limit, CL). For both species, isotope results indicated considerable individual specialization in foraging behavior, likely related to use of channel habitat versus use of the marsh. Power analysis showed that measuring 3 composite samples each comprising 10 to 15 individual fish should provide relatively low errors of 0.5 parts per thousand (95 % CL) or less around stable isotope averages. Use of such composite samples in monitoring programs will allow detection of significant temporal and spatial changes in benthic-planktonic coupling for salt marsh ecosystems, as recorded in average fish diets. Analyzing some individual fish also is recommended to obtain more detailed information on fish food sources, feeding specializations, and end-member isotope values used in estimating importance of benthic and planktonic food sources.

AB  - Carbon cycling by microbes has been recognized as the main mechanism of organic matter decomposition and export in coastal wetlands, yet very little is known about the functional diversity of specific groups of decomposers (e.g., bacteria) in salt marsh benthic trophic structure. Indeed, salt marsh sediment bacteria remain largely in a black box in terms of their diversity and functional roles within salt marsh benthic food web pathways. We used DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) utilizing C-13-labeled lignocellulose as a proxy to evaluate the fate of macrophyte-derived carbon in benthic salt marsh bacterial communities. Overall, 146 bacterial species were detected using SIP of which only 12 lineages were shared between enriched and non-enriched communities. Abundant groups from the C-13-labeled community included Desulfosarcina, Spirochaeta, and Kangiella. This study is the first to use heavy-labeled lignocellulose to identify bacteria responsible for macrophyte carbon utilization in salt marsh sediments and will allow future studies to target specific lineages to elucidate their role in salt marsh carbon cycling and ultimately aid our understanding of the potential of salt marshes to store carbon.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are projected to experience increases in anthropogenic and climatic disturbances, which may alter plant-sediment feedbacks critical for maintaining marsh resilience to sea level. To study the effects of disturbance on ecogeomorphic processes, we examined aboveground plant responses and sediment accretion in three locations relative to the shoreline (low, mid, and high) within a tidal marsh at Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. This study site was affected by two hurricanes in the fall of 2008, and subsequently burned as part of a controlled experiment in January 2009, permitting examination of the effects of two disturbance types on aboveground plant responses and vertical accretion. Fire and hurricanes affected these response variables differently, with effects dependent on location within the marsh. Fire significantly reduced standing aboveground biomass, and subsequent recovery of vegetation relative to pre-burn levels was faster in low marsh plots nearest to the shore than in high marsh plots closest to the marsh-pine ecotone. Hurricanes introduced sediment to the marsh platform, resulting in greater accretion in low marsh plots that had more standing biomass and higher stem densities than high marsh plots. Collectively, these results demonstrate that disturbances can heterogeneously affect surface soil-building processes in marshes through effects on sediment and organic matter accumulation, which may have important consequences for surface elevation maintenance in coastal marshes.

AB  - This synthesis is framed within the scope of the Brazilian Benthic Coastal Habitat Monitoring Network (ReBentos WG 4: Mangroves and Salt Marshes), focusing on papers that examine biodiversity-climate interactions as well as human-induced factors including those that decrease systemic resilience. The goal is to assess difficulties related to the detection of climate and early warning signals from monitoring data. We also explored ways to circumvent some of the obstacles identified. Exposure and sensitivity of mangrove and salt marsh species and ecosystems make them extremely vulnerable to environmental impacts and potential indicators of sea level and climate-driven environmental change. However, the interpretation of shifts in mangroves and salt marsh species and systemic attributes must be scrutinized considering local and setting-level energy signature changes; including disturbance regime and local stressors, since these vary widely on a regional scale. The potential for adaptation and survival in response to climate change depends, in addition to the inherent properties of species, on contextual processes at the local, landscape, and regional levels that support resilience. Regardless of stressor type, because of the convergence of social and ecological processes, coastal zones should be targeted for anticipatory action to reduce risks and to integrate these ecosystems into adaptation strategies. Management must be grounded on proactive mitigation and collaborative action based on long-term ecosystem-based studies and well-designed monitoring programs that can 1) provide real-time early warning and 2) close the gap between simple correlations that provide weak inferences and process-based approaches that can yield increasingly reliable attribution and improved levels of anticipation.

AB  - In this study, lignin-derived phenols, stable carbon isotopes and bulk elemental compositions were determined along the length of two sediment cores (Cl and C2) from the Andong salt marsh, which is located southwest of Hangzhou Bay, China. The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term changes and their implications along sediment profiles. The 1997 high tide had caused an increase in the terrestrial organic matter (OM) signal from 1996/1997 to 2000 in both cores, which was indicated by a high A (total lignin in mg/100 mg OC), TOC, C/N and more negative delta C-13 values. The slight increases in terrestrial OM along the length of the cores between 2003 and 2006 were most likely attributable to the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Both events have likely caused an increase in erosion, and thus, these events have increased the input of terrestrial OM to nearby areas. The effects of the distinctively dry year of 2006 can be observed along C2 between 2006 and 2008 in the steadily declining terrestrial OM signal. The overall slight decrease in terrestrial OM and the distinct increase in TOC along the length of both cores toward the present were most likely because of the overall reduced sediment caused by the trapping of materials within reservoirs. These results show that the reduction in terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh for the past 30 years was due to reservoirs and the 2006 drought, but this was counterbalanced by the 1997 high tide event and construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which resulted in increased erosion and terrestrial OM input.

AB  - The ecological range of the halophilous plants were studied in the salt marsh of Txipio (Butroi river) in northern Spain, with respect to some of the most influential edaphic parameters (moisture, conductivity, pH, organic matter) of the environment. This area has been undergoing a natural regeneration since 1965, when tide broke the water retaining walls and agricultural activities were stopped at the site. Thirteen plant species occurred and the most abundant ones were analysed according to different edaphic parameters. Conductivity was the primary factor explaining the distribution of halophilous plants. Texture was also a conditioning factor in species distribution in the marsh, while pH was not determinant, Despite the low regeneration time of the site, the species distribution and edaphic conditions showed a significant recovery of the area.

AB  - Atriplex portulacoides is one of the most frequent species on natural salt marshes along the French coasts and appears to be an important source of organic matter potentially available for exportation towards coastal sea waters. We followed the evolution of the biomass of this species in a macrotidal salt marsh in the ''baie du Mont-Saint-Michel'' for 3 years and at different locations in the marsh, in order to determine spatial and inter-annual variations of its productivity. Generally, Atriplex portulacoides presented a higher production in the most frequently flooded area, where environmental conditions appeared to be optimal. However, during a specific year in which a micro-lepidoptera invaded the lower part of the marsh, the primary production of Atriplex portulacoides decreased in this area. Even though this vegetation type present an apparent homogeneity, it appears important to take into account the variation of its primary production in any studies about salt-marsh functioning and exchanges with sea waters.

AB  - To counteract extensive wetland loss a series of diversion projects have been implemented to introduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into Louisiana coastal wetlands. To keep pace with increases in water level due to subsidence Louisiana coastal marshes must vertically accrete through the accumulation of both organic matter and mineral sediment. The impact of Mississippi River freshwater diversion on enhancing vertical marsh accretion (mineral and organic matter accumulation) was examined in Breton Sound estuary, a coastal wetland experiencing marsh deterioration as result of subsidence and salt water intrusion. Using Cs-137 dating and artificial marker horizons, increases in the rate of vertical marsh accretion were measured at marsh sites along a spatial gradient which has been receiving diverted water from the Mississippi River (Caernarvon diversion) since 1991. Vertical accretion and accumulation of mineral sediment organic matter and nutrients in the marsh soil profile, increased at marsh sites receiving freshwater and sediment input. Iron and manganese content of the marsh surface sediment were shown to be an excellent signature of riverine sediment deposition. Soil extractable phosphorus was higher and extractable sodium was lower at sites nearest freshwater and sediment input. Results demonstrated that freshwater diversion through sediment input and lowering of salinity will enhance marsh accretion and stability, slowing or reversing the rate of wetland loss.

AB  - About half of annual marine carbon burial takes place in shallow water ecosystems where geomorphic and ecological stability is driven by interactions between the flow of water, vegetation growth and sediment transport(1). Although the sensitivity of terrestrial and deep marine carbon pools to climate change has been studied for decades, there is little understanding of how coastal carbon accumulation rates will change and potentially feed back on climate(2,3). Here we develop a numerical model of salt marsh evolution, informed by recent measurements of productivity and decomposition, and demonstrate that competition between mineral sediment deposition and organic-matter accumulation determines the net impact of climate change on carbon accumulation in intertidal wetlands. We find that the direct impact of warming on soil carbon accumulation rates is more subtle than the impact of warming-driven sea level rise, although the impact of warming increases with increasing rates of sea level rise. Our simulations suggest that the net impact of climate change will be to increase carbon burial rates in the first half of the twenty-first century, but that carbon-climate feedbacks are likely to diminish over time.

AB  - Since an important fraction of the organic matter produced by salt marshes is decomposed in situ, macro-benthic communities are particularly exposed to the trace metals retained by these systems. Yet, few studies have investigated the macro-benthic communities using the between-root sediment habitat of the salt marsh halophytes (salt-tolerant plants), or the effect of trace metal pollution on its population dynamics. In the present study, samples were collected in vegetated and unvegetated sediment, in three salt marshes in the Tagus estuary, for trace metal concentration determination in the sediment and in the halophytes roots, grain size determination and macro-benthic organism identification. Data analysis revealed that the distribution of macro-benthic organisms is mainly determined by metal contamination, metal type and by the presence/absence of halophytes, not by the halophyte species. Five different associations were identified: resistant organisms were associated with the highest concentrations of lead (sediment); tolerant organisms with zinc, copper (sediment and roots) and lead (roots); cadmium in the sediment with a lack of macro-benthic life; sensitive organisms with low levels of metals except for cadmium in the roots; and macro-benthos typical of intertidal mudflats with unvegetated areas with low metal contamination.

AB  - Salt-marsh estuarine sediments are not homogeneous. It is obvious that a steady state cannot be assumed if the depositional environments under which salt marshes accumulate change from subtidal through non-vegetated intertidal to vegetated intertidal state during their formation. In addition to these, the supply of sedimentary material depends on the tidal prism which changes as salt marshes are formed. Based on the study of cores collected in the estuarine region of Georgia, USA, it was found that the Mn/Al ratios in sediments of marsh cores change from subtidal through non-vegetated intertidal to vegetated intertidal. The relative variation of biogenic silica preserved in sediments of marsh core reflects the relative supply rate of organic carbon (phytoplankton) produced in the water column to the sediment surface at the time of deposition. In this paper it is proposed that sediment manganese and biogenic silica may be applied as geochemical indicators of changing depositional environments and organic carbon originating from phytoplankton in the estuarine salt marsh sediments.

AB  - Salt marshes are coastal areas storing high amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) while simultaneously being prone to tidal changes. Here, SOM-decomposition and accompanied priming effects (PE), which describe interactions between labile and old SOM, were studied under controlled flooding conditions. Soil samples from two Wadden Sea salt marsh zones, pioneer (Pio), flooded two times/day, and lower salt marsh (Low), flooded similar to eight times/month, were measured for 56 days concerning CO2-efflux and prokaryotic community shifts during three different inundation-treatments: total-drained (Drained), all-time-flooded (Waterlogged) or temporal-flooding (Tidal). Priming was induced by C-14-glucose addition. CO2-efflux from soil followed Low>Pio and Tidal>Drained>Waterlogged, likely due to O-2-depletion and moisture maintenance, two key factors governed by tidal inundation with regard to SOM mineralisation. PEs in both zones were positive (Drained) or absent (Waterlogged, Tidal), presumably as a result of prokaryotes switching from production of extracellular enzymes to direct incorporation of labile C. A doubled amount of prokaryotic biomass in Low compared to Pio probably induced higher chances of cometabolic effects and higher PE. 16S-rRNA-gene-amplicon-based analysis revealed differences in bacterial and archaeal community composition between both zones, revealing temporal niche adaptation with flooding treatment. Strongest alterations were found in Drained, likely due to inundation-mediated changes in C-binding capacities.

AB  - To better understand how seasonal change and the presence of plants affect biogeochemical iron (Fe) cycling in tidal marsh sediments, we examined the seasonal dynamics of microbial Fe reduction (FeR) and related Fe speciation from 2012 to 2014 using in situ vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms created with macrobenthos-proof enclosures. The pools of Fe(III) oxides, Fe sulfides, porewater Fe2+, and rates of microbial sulfate reduction (SR) peaked in summer (hot and wet), whereas rates of FeR and non-sulfidic Fe(II) levels peaked in winter (mild and dry). Sedge presence greatly increased the FeR rate, organic matter pools, and Fe(III) oxide levels, but decreased carbon: nitrogen ratios and sulfide abundances. FeR rates were mainly affected by the SR level, and temperature and plant primary productivity had comparable effects on SR rates. The dominant organic carbon mineralization pathway changed from SR in summer to FeR in winter in both vegetated and unvegetated mesocosms. FeR was more important in the vegetated mesocosms than in the unvegetated mesocosms, and seasonal change contributed more to the total variability of each anaerobic pathway than the presence of sedge. Our study reveals that temperature and plants both mediate variations in the organic carbon mineralization pathways of a subtropical estuarine tidal marsh.

AB  - Salt marshes near urban, industrial and mining areas are often affected both by heavy metals and by eutrophic water. The aim of this study was to assess and evaluate the main processes involved in the decrease of nitrate concentration in pore water of mine wastes flooded with eutrophic water, considering the presence or absence of plant rhizhosphere. Basic (pH similar to 7.8) carbonated loam mine wastes and free-carbonated acidic (pH similar to 6.2) sandy-loam mine wastes were collected from polluted coastal salt marshes of SE Spain which regularly receive nutrient-enriched water. The wastes were put in pots and flooded for 15 weeks with eutrophic water (dissolved organic carbon similar to 26 mg L-1, PO43- similar to 23 mg L-1, NO3- similar to 180 mg L-1). Three treatments were assayed for each type of waste: pots with Sarcocornia fruticosa, pots with Phragmites australis and unvegetated pots. Soluble organic carbon, nitrate, soluble Cd. Pb and Zn, pH and Eh were monitored. But the 2nd day of flooding, nitrate concentrations had decreased between 70% and 90% (equivalent to 1.01-1.12 g N-NO3- m(-2) day(-1)) with respect to the content in the water used for flooding, except in unvegetated pots with acidic wastes. Denitrification was the main mechanism associated with the removal of nitrate. The role of vegetation in improving the rhizospheric environment was relevant in the acidic wastes because higher sand content, lower pH and higher soluble metal concentrations might strongly hinder microbial activity Hence, revegetation of salt marshes polluted by acidic sandy mining wastes might improve the capacity of this type of environment to act as a green filter against excessive nitrate contents flowing through them.

AB  - This paper deals with the organic matter dynamics of a dwarf shrub species, Atriplex portulacoides, which characterizes the majority of ungrazed European salt marshes. These dynamics were investigated by the simultaneous estimation of primary production, litter production, decomposition processes and accumulation of organic matter in sediment. We used harvested biomass techniques and the litter-bag method, as well as more recent techniques such as determination of natural isotopic compositions. The results of this study have been compared with those of other studies of salt marshes of the Eastern Coast of America dominated by Spartina alterniflora.
   Studies of the fate of halophytic organic matter in salt marshes have shown that processes such as consumption, decomposition, or flooding rapidly could distribute organic material to different compartments of the marsh system. Aboveground productivity of A. portulacoides was 1700 g m(-2) yr(-1). Approximately 80% of this production was transformed rapidly in necromass. A large part of this dead material (86%) fell as litter directly onto the sediment at the sampling site. The remainder was washed away by tides, either out of the marsh, or into the upper marsh where it accumulated in drift lines. Decomposition of A. portulacoides on the sediment was followed using litter-bags. Decay constants, based on the first order decay function, ranged between 0.0404 d(-1) and 0.0113 d(-1) and appeared high when compare with data obtained in other American and European salt marshes. Nitrogen immobilisation was not detectable in this decomposition experiment. During decay, nitrogen concentrations increased, whereas absolute amount of nitrogen decreased. After microbial decomposition, plant detritus was rapidly incorporated into sediment. The carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in sediment showed that organic matter in the middle marsh came from both aboveground production of A. portulacoides and microalgae. The patterns for these two kinds of organic matter in different granulometric fractions depended on tidal submersion frequency. During the summer, when the salt marsh was not disturbed by tides, the clay fraction got richer in plant organic matter, whereas, during the other periods, this fraction was characterized by microalgal organic matter.
   This study provides new data about the dynamic of organic matter. It remains still difficult to establish comparisons between North American and European salt marsh functioning according to the variability of primary production, microbial decomposition and tidal range in these ecosystems.

AB  - The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production by plants. These accretion processes respond to changes in local and global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear. In particular, marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate change, has not yet been isolated and quantified. Using the available observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen levels. We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60% in the range of forcings explored. Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics. Our results imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent, are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than previously thought.

AB  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions from cattle grazed and un-grazed temperate upper salt marsh were measured using dark static chambers, monthly for one year. Below-ground gas sampling tubes were also used to measure soil methane (CH4) concentrations. CH4 efflux from grazed and un-grazed salt marsh did not differ significantly although grazing did lead to 'hotspots' of underground CH4 (up to 6% of total air volume) and CH4 efflux (peak of 9 mg m(-2) h(-1)) significantly linked to high soil moisture content, low soil temperatures and the presence of Juncus gerardii. Carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux was greater from the ungrazed marsh (mean of 420 mg m(-2) h(-1)) than the grazed marsh (mean of 333 mg m(-2) h(-1)) throughout most of the year and was positively correlated with the deeper water table and greater soil temperatures. Grazing was not a significant predictor of nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions. Global Warming Potential (GWP; over 100 years), calculated from mean yearly chamber fluxes for CH4 and CO2, did not differ significantly with grazing treatment Seasonal variation in the key drivers of soil greenhouse gas efflux; soil temperature, moisture and water table, plus the presence or absence of aerenchymatous plants such as J. gerardii were more important to the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions than grazing management per se.

AB  - The distribution of carbon (C) within a salt marsh may vary among vegetation zones depending on production and decomposition dynamics and organic and mineral depositional history. We examined spatial and temporal variation of plant and soil C pools within a salt marsh fringing a coastal lagoon along the mid-Atlantic coast of the U. S. The total plant C pool increased from high marsh shrub to low marsh grass dominated areas. Much of the spatial variation in plant C pool was due to fine roots and small organic matter (dlm) that could not be identified by species, which averaged 2398 gC m(-2) in Spartina patens-dominated, 2215 gC m(-2) in Spartina alterniflora-dominated, and 676 gC m-2 in Juncus roemerianus-dominated areas. Belowground C pool loss was 36% less for S. patens than S. alterniflora and was similar between S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus. Accretion and C accumulation rates were greater in the S. alterniflora-dominated stand than in the J. roemerianus-dominated stand. Our results suggest that landward migration onto terrestrial soils can lead to an estimated 80% increase in belowground plant C composed primarily of fine roots and dlm and 36-70% increase in soil carbon between 15 and 30 cm depths.

AB  - Disentangling the relative influences of soil properties and plant-host on root-associated microbiomes in natural systems is challenging, given that spatially segregated soil types display distinct historical legacies. In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.

AB  - The effects of mound building ants on soil and vegetation have been described worldwide; however, few studies have explored their effects in salt marsh communities. Here, we studied the effects of the black fire ant Solenopsis richteri on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh. We found that S. richteri nests are more abundant in the high marsh than in the low marsh and in the terrestrial environment. Sediment characteristics were examined in the above-ground and below-ground portions of nests, and in the surrounding soil apart from them. Nests' sediment had lower organic matter content, lower bulk density and higher pH values than the non-nest soil. These differences were in general more marked in the above-ground portion of nests. Grain size distribution was biased towards coarser grain particles in nests, with the smallest particles being more abundant in the non-nest soil. Ammonium content was higher in the nests than in the non-nest soil, despite nitrate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen were not different. Phosphate content was higher in the below-ground portion than in the above-ground portion of nests. Samplings and transplant experiments showed that plants growing in contact with mounds grew longer, had wider stems and higher root biomass than plants apart from mounds. These results indicate that by affecting sediment characteristics, ants indirectly and positively affect plants condition, with potential cascading up effects on community structure and dynamics. Because mounds are relocated every similar to 3.5 months, bioturbation impacts may extend over time through the whole high marsh, highlighting the role that black fire ants may have in the ecology of southwestern Atlantic marshes.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems have an important role as contaminant filters. Temporal variations in concentrations, enrichment factors (EF), and fluxes of trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) were evaluated in 210Pb-dated sediment cores from salt marsh and seagrass ecosystems at San Quint?n Bay (Mexican northern Pacific). Trace element contamination was negligible in seagrass sediments, but minor to severe, depending on the element, in salt marsh cores, owing to higher organic carbon and fine sediment contents. EF temporal variation in salt marsh cores was attributed to agriculture technology changes (e.g. installation of greenhouses, and improved irrigation and fertilization systems). Trace element flux ratios increased during the past 100 years, likely caused by steadily increasing sediment accumulation rates promoted by land-use changes in the catchment. The conservation of salt marsh areas is important to preserve their function as contaminants biofilters and the health of adjacent ecosystems.

AB  - Vegetation structure and soil properties were measured on a sandbar, a three year old sandbar emergent marsh (SEM). and five mature Spartina alterniflora Loisel marshes located near the mouth of the Altamaha River (Georgia, USA) to determine flow quickly tidal marsh vegetation and soils develop during primary succession. Those data were compared to published data collected from young (10-16 yr old) natural marshes in Virginia and young (1-28 yr old) constructed marshes in North Carolina to determine if the rate of ecosystem development is similar among, tidal marshes of the southeastern US Coast. Within three years of emergence, aboveground biomass of SEM was comparable to mature marshes in the area, although stem height mid density were distinctly different as the SEM contained more stems that were of shorter height than mature marshes. Following, colonization by vegetation, soil properties (0 30 cm) of SEM had begun to differentiate from sediments of the sandbar. Surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-30 cm) soil bulk density was less. mid organic carbon (C). nitrogen (N) mid percent sill (0-10 cm) were greater in sediments of SEM than ill the sandbar. Even so. soils of SEM contained less organic C, N. silt, and clay than mature marshes. However. accumulation rates of organic C (260 +/- 40 g m (2) yr(-1)) and N (11 +/- 3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) in soils of SEM was 5 to 7 times greater than in mature marshes (35 +/- 4 C m(-2) yr(-1), 2 +/- 0.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) Trajectories of development for Soil organic C and N Pools were similar for our SEM, young natural S. alterniflora marshes in Virginia, and young constructed S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina suggesting, that Soil development proceeds at similar rates for tidal marshes along, much of the southeast US Coast.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry has been studied in multiple wetland ecosystems, though few data exist on P sorption in U.S. Gulf Coast marshes. There also is a limited understanding of how oil spills in coastal zones can influence P dynamics in wetland soils. In this study, we measured P sorption potential, using the P sorption index (PSI), soil properties, and P saturation at increasing distances from the marsh edge in oiled and unoiled marshes in three regions along the southeastern Louisiana coast (Terrebonne Bay, western, and eastern Barataria Bay). Individual PSI values were highly variable, ranging from 19.5 to 175.6mg P 100g(-1) and varying by at least a factor of five within each of the three regions, and did not significantly differ between regions or between oiled and unoiled marshes. Soil pH, organic matter, total N, N:P ratio, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, and P saturation differed between regions, and all soil parameters showed great variability between and within individual marshes. Extractable iron was the strongest predictor of PSI across all regions, explaining between 51 and 95% of the variability in individual regions. PSI increased with distance from marsh edge in Terrebonne Bay where other soil properties exhibited similar trends. Results suggest mineral composition of marsh soils, influenced by elevation-inundation gradients, are critical in dictating P loading to estuaries and open waters, and overall marsh functioning. Further, within 2 years of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, oiled marshes are able to sorb phosphorus at comparable levels as unoiled marshes.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico shoreline received varied types and amounts of weathered oil residues after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At the time, predicting how marsh bacterial communities would respond and/or recover to oiling and other environmental stressors was difficult because baseline information on community composition and dynamics was generally unavailable. Here, we evaluated marsh vegetation, physicochemistry, flooding frequency, hydrocarbon chemistry, and subtidal sediment bacterial communities from 16S rRNA gene surveys at 11 sites in southern Louisiana before the oil spill and resampled the same marshes three to four times over 38 months after the spill. Calculated hydrocarbon biomarker indices indicated that oil replaced native natural organic matter (NOM) originating from Spartina alterniflora and marine phytoplankton in the marshes between May 2010 and September 2010. At all the studied marshes, the major class-and order-level shifts among the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria occurred within these first 4 months, but another community shift occurred at the time of peak oiling in 2011. Two years later, hydrocarbon levels decreased and bacterial communities became more diverse, being dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales), Chloroflexi (Dehalococcoidia), and Planctomycetes. Compositional changes through time could be explained by NOM source differences, perhaps due to vegetation changes, as well as marsh flooding and salinity excursions linked to freshwater diversions. These findings indicate that persistent hydrocarbon exposure alone did not explain long-term community shifts.
   IMPORTANCE Significant deterioration of coastal salt marshes in Louisiana has been linked to natural and anthropogenic stressors that can adversely affect how ecosystems function. Although microorganisms carry out and regulate most biogeochemical reactions, the diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marshes is poorly known, with limited investigation of potential changes in bacterial communities in response to various environmental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term effects of an oil spill on microbial systems in marshes. Compared to previous studies, the significance of our research stems from (i) a broader geographic range of studied marshes, (ii) an extended time frame of data collection that includes prespill conditions, (iii) a more accurate procedure using biomarker indices to understand oiling, and (iv) an examination of other potential stressors linked to in situ environmental changes, aside from oil exposure.

AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) of salt marshes has not been well studied but is central to production efficiency models (PEMs) used for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Salt marshes are typically dominated by a species monoculture, resulting in large areas with distinct morphology and physiology. We measured eddy covariance atmospheric CO2 fluxes for two marshes dominated by a different species: Juncus roemerianus in Mississippi and Spartina alterniflora in Georgia. LUE for the Juncus marsh (mean = 0.160 +/- 0.004 g C mol(-1) photon), reported here for the first time, was on average similar to the Spartina marsh (mean = 0.164 +/- 0.003 g C mol(-1) photon). However, Juncus LUE had a greater range (0.073-0.49 g C mol(-1) photon) and higher variability (15.2%) than the Spartina marsh (range: 0.035-0.36 g C mol(-1) photon; variability: 12.7%). We compared the responses of LUE across six environmental gradients. Juncus LUE was predominantly driven by cloudiness, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperature, water table, and vapor pressure deficit. Spartina LUE was driven by water table, air temperature, and cloudiness. We also tested how the definition of LUE (incident PAR vs. absorbed PAR) affected the magnitude of LUE and its response. We found LUE estimations using incident PAR underestimated LUE and masked day-to-day variability. Our findings suggest that salt marsh LUE parametrization should be species-specific due to plant morphology and physiology and their geographic context. These findings can be used to improve PEMs for modeling blue carbon productivity.

AB  - High nitrogen (N) loading rates received by coastal bays can have deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems. Salt marshes can intercept land-based N through seasonal plant uptake, denitrification, and burial. Salt marshes fringing Delaware's Inland Bays are characterized by different plant species occurring in close proximity. To evaluate N pool retention and loss for the dominant plant species, we measured seasonal N concentration and pool size, N resorption efficiency, loss during decomposition, and soil N. Seasonal variation in N pools and fluxes differed among species. Seasonal differences in the total N pools of the herbaceous species were largely influenced by belowground fine root and dead macro-organic matter fluxes. N production rate estimates ranged from 18 g N m(-2) year(-1) aboveground for the high marsh shrub to 40.8 g N m(-2) year(-1) above- and belowground for the high marsh rush illustrating the importance of incorporating species-specific dynamics into ecosystem N budgets.

AB  - The monthly variations of below- and aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora were documented for a south Louisiana salt marsh from March 2004 to March 2005, and in March 2006 and 2007. The annual production rate above- and belowground was 1821 and 11,676 g m(-2), respectively (Smalley method), and the annual production rate per biomass belowground was 10.7 g dry weight(-1), which are highs along the latitudinal distributions of the plant's range. The average root + rhizome/shoot ratio (R&R/S) was 2.6:1, which is lower than the R&R/S ratios of 4 to 5.1 reported for Spartina sp. marshes in the northeastern US. The belowground biomass increased from July to September and fluctuated between October and November, after which it declined until February when the growing season began. The belowground biomass was dominated by rhizomes, which declined precipitously in spring and then rose to a seasonal high in the month before declining again as the late summer rise in inflorescence began. Over half of the root biomass in a 30-cm soil profile was in the upper 10 cm, and in the 10- to 20-cm profile for rhizomes. The maximum March biomass above- and belowground was four to five times that of the minimum biomass over the four sampling years. The net standing stock (NSS) of N and P in live biomass aboveground compared to that in the belowground biomass was about 1.7 times higher and equal, respectively, but the NSS of N and P for the live + dead biomass was about six times higher belowground. The average nitrogen/phosphorous molar ratios of 16:1 aboveground is in agreement with the often tested N limitation of biomass accumulation aboveground, whereas the 37:1 belowground ratio suggests that there is an influence of P on R&R foraging for P belowground. Some implications for management and restoration are, in part, that salt marshes should be evaluated and examined using information on the plant's physiology and production both below- and aboveground.

AB  - Aims Soil fungal communities play a critical role in ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Although the effect of plant invasions on ecosystem C and N cycling is well established, its impact on soil fungal communities is not fully understood. The objective of this study was therefore to understand the variations in soil fungal communities as affected by plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods We examined the impacts of invasive Spartina alternifolia Loisel. (SA) on soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups in comparison with bare flat (BF) and native Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall. (SS), Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang (SM), and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA) communities in coastal salt marshes of eastern China, based on analyses of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq DNA sequences of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Results SA invasion increased the soil fungal abundance and diversity compared to BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. The increased soil fungal abundance and diversity were highly related to soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), litter C:N ratio, and root C:N ratio. Soil fungal community composition was shifted following SA invasion. Specifically, SA invasion significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, and reduced the relative abundance of Ascomycota compared with BF, SS, SM, and PA soils. Additionally, SA invasion changed soil fungal trophic modes and functional groups. The relative abundance of saprotrophic fungi significantly increased, while the relative abundances of symbiotic and pathotrophic fungi decreased following SA invasion. Conclusions Our data revealed that SA invasion altered soil fungal abundance, diversity, community composition, trophic modes and functional groups, which were primarily driven by the quality and quantity of plant residues, soil nutrition substrates, as well as soil physicochemical properties. The changes in soil fungal communities, especially their trophic modes and functional groups following SA invasion would greatly affect soil C and N decomposition and accumulation with potential feedback on climate change.

AB  - This study dealt with the decomposition and nutrient release from the halophytes Atriplex portulacoides, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Limoniastrum monopetalum, and Spartina densiflora, the dominant species in the Castro Marim salt marsh, Portugal. Environmental effects on decomposition were also assessed. The study was carried out for one year using the in situ litterbag technique. S. densiflora showed a lower decomposition rate (k = 0.003 day(-1)) than the other study species (k = 0.005-0.009). Study species showed similar decomposition patterns, that is, the weight loss mostly occurred during the autumn-winter period (study beginning in November). This indicates that temperature in this period did not hamper the decomposition process. The decomposition rate was positively affected by the initial N concentration (r(2) = 0.87, P < 0.05) and negatively by the C:N ratio (r(2) = 0.86, P < 0.05) in decomposing materials. At the end of the study, S. densiflora and L. monopetalum, the species with lower initial N concentrations, retained much higher proportion of initial N (89-109%) than the others (5-14%). Also, S. densiflora with the lowest P concentration retained higher proportion of initial P (48%) than the others (5-20%). Release of K and Mg were also slower from S. densiflora and was associated with their initial low concentration in this species. The lowest Mn release was observed from A. macrostachyum and also in relation to the lowest initial concentration. Our study supports the hypothesis that decomposition patterns of marsh species are mostly associated with differences regarding their morphology and chemical composition. Given the higher resistance of S. densiflora to decomposition, its progressive spreading may result in accumulation of organic detritus overtime in invaded salt marshes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Salt marsh plants and seven surface sediment samples along a transect in the intertidal Bat area of Mont-Saint-Michel Bay were analysed for fatty acids and sterols. The presence of lipid markers of halophytes (long-chain fatty acids, 18 :3 omega 3, and phytosterols) in the surface layers of the sediment confirms the export of organic matter from the salt marsh to the intertidal flat. The spatial distribution of this organic matter over the tidal-flat area was controlled by the tidal currents and the presence of mussel beds, Lipid markers of diatoms (20:5 omega 3 and brassicasterol) and bacteria (18:1 omega 7 and odd, linear and branched, fatty acids) were also found in the surface sediments. Diatoms and benthic bacteria as well as organic matter From the salt marsh were the significant food sources available to the macrozoobenthos on the intertidal Bat. The ingestion of these food types by the dominant species of the macrozoobenthos was confirmed by the presence of their respective lipid markers in the animals, The presence of these markers in animals subjected to a starvation experiment confirmed that these food types are really assimilated. The lipid composition of the starved animals indicated that the species studied were able to accumulate the fatty acid 20:5 omega 3 (considered to be a diatom marker), and that the annelid Nereis diversicolor supported an internal bacterial population.

AB  - Sediments have been sampled in seven Tagus estuary salt marshes at three depths: 0-5 cm, 15-25 cm (zone of higher root density), and 45-55 cm (below the roots). Collection was done in areas colonised by Spartina maritima, Halimione portulacoides and Arthrocnenum fruticosum. Concentrations of zinc, lead, copper, cadmium and loss on ignition were determined, as well as the fraction of metals extracted by DTPA. Metal concentrations were not correlated to LOI, and enrichment factors (defined as the ratio of metal concentration in the 0-5 cm and 45-55 cm layers) were higher in salt marshes closer to the anthropogenic sources. However, the fraction of metals extracted by DTPA in sediment between roots was inversely correlated to LOI. This suggests that metals are more easily uptaken by the plants as organic matter in the sediments degrades.

AB  - Global vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) represent a large sink for organic carbon (OC) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil OC stocks from Chinese VCHs have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global OC sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil OC stocks, burial rates and losses of VCHs in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low OC stocks, storing 6.3 +/- 0.6, 7.5 +/- 0.6, and 1.6 +/- 0.6 Tg C (+/- 95% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 +/- 17, 159 +/- 57, and 6 +/- 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil OC stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2-395.4 Tg CO(2)e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.

AB  - A novel non-phototrophic, marine, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, strain S-1(T), was isolated from a coastal salt marsh in Massachusetts, USA. Cells are Gram-stain-negative vibrios motile by means of a single polar unsheathed flagellum. S-1(T) is an obligate microaerophile with limited metabolic capacity. It grows chemolithoautotrophically utilizing sulfide and thiosulfate as electron donors, converting these compounds to sulfate, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for carbon fixation. Cells of S-1(T) did not grow on any of a large number of organic carbon sources and there was no evidence for chemoorganoheterotrophic growth. Cells produced internal sulfur globules during growth on sulfide and thiosulfate. S-1(T) is strongly diazotrophic, as demonstrated by N-15(2) fixation and acetylene reduction activity by cells when a fixed nitrogen source is absent from the growth medium. The marine nature of this organism is evident from its ability to grow in 10 to 100% artificial seawater but not at lower concentrations and NaCl alone cannot substitute for sea salts. The major cellular fatty acids are C-16 : (1)omega 7c, C-16 : 0, and C-18 : 1 omega 7c. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol are the major polar lipids. Q8 is the only respiratory quinone. S-1(T) genomic DNA has a G+C content of 67.6 mol%. Based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence, S-1(T) shows the closest phylogenetic relationship to non-phototrophic species within the family Thioalkalispiraceae of the class Gammaproteobacteria. The name Endothiovibrio diazotrophicus is proposed for this organism, with S-1(T) as the type strain (ATCC BAA-1439(T)=JCM 17961(T)).

AB  - Marine-to-terrestrial transition represents one of the most fundamental shifts in microbial life. Understanding the distribution and drivers of soil microbial communities across coastal ecosystems is critical given the roles of microbes in soil biogeochemistry and their multifaceted influence on landscape succession. Here, we studied the fungal community dynamics in a well-established salt marsh chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development. We focussed on providing high-resolution assessments of community composition, diversity and ecophysiological shifts that yielded patterns of ecological succession through soil formation. Notably, despite containing 10- to 100-fold lower fungal internal transcribed spacer abundances, early-successional sites revealed fungal richnesses comparable to those of more mature soils. These newly formed sites also exhibited significant temporal variations in beta-diversity that may be attributed to the highly dynamic nature of the system imposed by the tidal regime. The fungal community compositions and ecophysiological assignments changed substantially along the successional gradient, revealing a clear signature of ecological replacement and gradually transforming the environment from a marine into a terrestrial system. Moreover, distance-based linear modelling revealed soil physical structure and organic matter to be the best predictors of the shifts in fungal beta-diversity along the chronosequence. Taken together, our study lays the basis for a better understanding of the spatiotemporally determined fungal community dynamics in salt marshes and highlights their ecophysiological traits and adaptation in an evolving ecosystem.

AB  - Estuaries are dynamic interfaces between land, rivers and the ocean that play major roles in the global carbon cycle. These coastal wetlands store huge amounts of organic carbon (OC), commonly known as "blue carbon" and excellent places to study C cycling. The Guadiana river estuary is among the most important tidal salt marshes in the South - Iberian coastal margin. Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary OM composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content (TOC) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23% and stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) also showed a wide range between -22.4 and -27.0 parts per thousand. A(13)C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic C-13 enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments. Series of nalkanes were found in the range from C-10 to C-31. Carbon preference index ratio (CPI) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C-24-C-31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse OM inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant OM derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments. A well-resolved series of long-chain linear alkyl benzenes (LABs from C-4 to C-22) were recorded in all core sediment samples indicating direct discharge of untreated domestic and/or industrial effluents to the estuary. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with more than 3 rings reflects the pyrogenic origin of a portion of the sedimentary OM. This study highlights the importance of different OM sources to the lower Guadiana estuarine sediments and contributes to a better knowledge about its origin, dynamics and fate.

AB  - A primary focus among microbial ecologists in recent years has been to understand controls on the distribution of microorganisms in various habitats. Much less attention has been paid to the way that environmental disturbance interacts with processes that regulate bacterial community composition. We determined how human disturbance affected the distribution and community structure of salt marsh sediment bacteria by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA in five different habitats in each of four salt marshes located in northeastern Massachusetts, USA. Two of the four marsh creeks were experimentally enriched 15 x above background by the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers for two or more growing seasons. Our results indicate that extrinsic factors acting at broad scales do not influence the distribution of salt marsh sediment bacteria. Intrinsic factors, controlled by local-scale environmental heterogeneity, do play a role in structuring these sediment microbial communities, although nutrient enrichment did not have a consequential effect on the microbial community in most marsh habitats. Only in one habitat, a region of the marsh creek wall that is heavily colonized by filamentous algae, did we see any effect of fertilization on the microbial community structure. When similar habitats were compared among marshes, there was considerable convergence in the microbial community composition during the growing season. Environmental factors that correlated best with microbial community composition varied with habitat, suggesting that habitat-specific intrinsic forces are primarily responsible for maintaining microbial diversity in salt marsh sediments.

AB  - Expansion of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes in the East China Sea coast is changing the ecosystem and thus, uncertainty has hampered methane (CH4) flux accounts in these areas. To analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of the CH4 fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, four plots were established in a salt marsh of the Nanhui coast in the southern fringe of the Yangtze River estuary, differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history and including one bare mudflat. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that CH4 fluxes from the plots ranged from 1.7 to 72.2 mg m(-2) h(-1). The mature Spartina sites showed higher CH4 emission, peaking in the summer. In the mudflat CH4 consumption was observed in January and the summer. The seasonal CH4 fluxes showed positive correlation (p < 0.05) with temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation), and negative correlation (p < 0.05) with water salinity. Various diurnal cycles in the CH4 fluxes were observed at different seasons. Average CH4 emissions were higher during the daytime than at night, however, without significant difference. Thus, the CH4 fluxes started to rise at noon, and the maximum CH4 flux was observed after the ebb tide (at 18:00) during nighttime. The diurnal variation in CH4 fluxes showed a significant correlation with season but not with temperature.

AB  - Introduction: Tidal marsh systems along the Pacific coast of the United States have experienced substantial stress and loss of area and ecosystem function, which we examined by using the endangered California Ridgway's Rail, Rallus obsoletus obsoletus ('rail') as an indicator of its tidal marsh habitat in the San Francisco Estuary. We organized a collection of historical (1885-1940) and modern (2005-2014) rail feathers and analyzed the feather isotope means for delta carbon (delta C-13), sulfur (delta S-34), and nitrogen (delta N-15) by region and time period.
   Outcomes: Feather isotopes represented the primary foraging habitat during historical then modern time periods. Neither individual nor regional rail feather isotopes suggested freshwater or terrestrial foraging by the rail. Three regions with both historic and modern feather isotopes revealed non-uniform spatial shifts in isotope levels consistent with a marine based food web and significant delta N-15 enrichment.
   Discussion: Our results supported the rail's status as a generalist forager and obligate tidal marsh species throughout the historic record. The variable isoscape trends generated from feather isotope means illustrated a modern loss of the isotopic homogeneity between regions of historical tidal marsh, which correlated with spatially-explicit habitat alterations such as increasing biological invasions and sewage effluent over time.
   Conclusion: These findings have reinforced the importance of tidal marsh conservation in the face of ongoing underlying changes to these important ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes are significant contributors to global "blue carbon" resources, and these habitats are sensitive to precipitation events due to periodically dry-wet alternation induced by tides. However, whether annual marsh-atmospheric CO2 flux responds more to annual or seasonal precipitation remains unclear. Here, eight years (2012-2019) of eddy covariance data were evaluated to determine typical CO2 budgets, and we assessed the effect of annual and seasonal precipitation on interannual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta, China. The salt marsh was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in each of the eight study years, with an 8-year average NEE of -51.7 +/- 9.7 g C m(-2) a(-1) varying from -8 to -85 g C m(-2) a(-1). Annual NEE was mainly regulated by precipitation levels during the early growth stage of plants, which modulated maximal plant biomass accumulation via water-salt transport. Besides, a spring precipitation distribution experiment showed that wetter early growth stage of plants enhanced carbon assimilation capacity in the salt marsh by decreasing soil salinity and promoting plant biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that soil water-salt conditions induced by precipitation during the onset of the growing season are crucial for interannual variations of NEE in salt marshes.

AB  - Much of the low-lying farmland around the coastline of south-cast England was once inter-tidal salt marsh, which was subsequently reclaimed from the sea and converted to farmland. It is becoming increasingly uneconomic to maintain the embankments which protect this land from the sea.
   'Managed retreat' involves relocating the embankments further inland and recreating inter-tidal habitat in front of them. Salt marsh not only provides a protective buffer for these sea walls by dissipating wave energy, but is also important as a habitat for birds and as a source of organic matter for fish and inter-tidal fauna.
   When 'managed retreat' takes place, the creation of inter-tidal habitat occurs on soils that have undergone physical and chemical changes, some of which are irreversible. However, the indications are that rapid sedimentation creates conditions in which salt marsh plants germinate and become established; soil salinity rises quickly to a level which restricts competition from terrestrial plants, and deposited sediment is relatively rich in available phosphorus. The physical properties of the old agricultural soil influence the subsequent development of creeks.

AB  - The oil released during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill may have both short-and long-time impacts on the northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. An understanding of how the composition and concentration of the oil are altered by weathering, including chemical, physical and biological processes, is needed to evaluate the oil toxicity and impact on the ecosystem in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This study examined petroleum hydrocarbons in oil mousse collected from the sea surface and salt marshes, and in oil deposited in sediments adjacent to the wellhead after the DWH oil spill. Oil mousses were collected at two stations (OSS and CT, located 130 and 85 km away from the wellhead, respectively) in May 2010, and two sediment samples from stations SG and SC, within 6 km of the wellhead, in May 2011. We also collected oil mousse from salt marshes at Marsh Point (MP), Mississippi, 186 km away from the wellhead in July 2010. In these samples, n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylated PAHs, BTEX (collective name of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-, m-, and o-xylenes), C3-benzenes and trace metals were measured to examine how the oil was altered chemically. The chemical analysis indicates that the oil mousses underwent different degrees of weathering with the pattern of OSS < CT < MP. This pattern is consistent with the projected oil mousse movement from the accident site to salt marshes. Also, the contents of trace metals Al, V, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, As and Pb in the oil mousse generally increased along the way to the salt marshes, indicating that these trace metals were perhaps aggregated into the oil mousse during the transport. Petroleum hydrocarbon data reveal that the oil deposited in sediments underwent only light to moderate degradation one year after the DWH oil spill, as supported by the presence of short-chained n-alkanes (C10-C15), BTEX and C3-benzenes. The weathering of oil in sediment may result from biological degradation and dissolution, evidenced by the preferential loss of mid-chained n- alkanes C16-C27, lower ratios of n-C-17/Pr and n-C-18/Ph, and preferential loss of PAHs relative to alkylated PAHs.

AB  - In the Northeastern U.S., salt marsh area is in decline. Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and marsh drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Measures of marsh vegetation loss for eight sites in Rhode Island and New York between ca.1970 and 2011 indicate that substantial loss has occurred over past decades, with higher loss rates found for lower elevation salt marshes. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and LiDAR datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast, and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We estimate that 87 % of Northeastern salt marshes are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation regime was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.

AB  - This study was carried out in a Mediterranean salt marsh in semiarid Southeast Spain to assess whether a spatial salinity gradient can affect the microbiological and biochemical properties (labile C fractions, biomass C, oxidoreductases, and hydrolases) of the rhizosphere soil of Inula crithmoides and the extent of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization in its roots. There were no significant differences in the soluble C fractions (water-soluble C and water-soluble carbohydrates) or the microbial biomass C values of the rhizosphere soil of L crithmoides among the different zones of the salt marsh. Dehydrogenase activity, hydrolases (urease, protease, phosphatase, and beta-glucosidase) and the extent of AM colonization in I. crithmoides roots were greater in the higher salt marsh zones, corresponding to those of lower rhizosphere soil salinity. This study shows that soil salinity is inversely associated with some parameters related to soil microbial activity, such as dehydrogenase activity and some hydrolases, as well as the extent of colonization by AM fungi, which can improve plant performance. However, bioactive organic matter fractions that determine soil productivity are not related to soil salinity.

AB  - Tidal marshes maintain elevation relative to sea level through accumulation of mineral and organic matter, yet this dynamic accumulation feedback mechanism has not been modeled widely in the context of accelerated sea-level rise. Uncertainties exist about tidal marsh resiliency to accelerated sea-level rise, reduced sediment supply, reduced plant productivity under increased inundation, and limited upland habitat for marsh migration. We examined marsh resiliency under these uncertainties using the Marsh Equilibrium Model, a mechanistic, elevation-based soil cohort model, using a rich data set of plant productivity and physical properties from sites across the estuarine salinity gradient. Four tidal marshes were chosen along this gradient: two islands and two with adjacent uplands. Varying century sea-level rise (52, 100, 165, 180 cm) and suspended sediment concentrations (100%, 50%, and 25% of current concentrations), we simulated marsh accretion across vegetated elevations for 100 years, applying the results to high spatial resolution digital elevation models to quantify potential changes in marsh distributions. At low rates of sea-level rise and mid-high sediment concentrations, all marshes maintained vegetated elevations indicative of mid/high marsh habitat. With century sea-level rise at 100 and 165 cm, marshes shifted to low marsh elevations; mid/high marsh elevations were found only in former uplands. At the highest century sea-level rise and lowest sediment concentrations, the island marshes became dominated by mudflat elevations. Under the same sediment concentrations, low salinity brackish marshes containing highly productive vegetation had slower elevation loss compared to more saline sites with lower productivity. A similar trend was documented when comparing against a marsh accretion model that did not model vegetation feedbacks. Elevation predictions using the Marsh Equilibrium Model highlight the importance of including vegetation responses to sea-level rise. These results also emphasize the importance of adjacent uplands for long-term marsh survival and incorporating such areas in conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Southern New England salt marsh vegetation and habitats are changing rapidly in response to sea-level rise. At the same time, fiddler crab (Uca spp.) distributions have expanded and purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing on creekbank vegetation has increased. Sea-level rise and reduced predation pressure drive these changing crab populations but most studies focus on one species; there is a need for community-level assessments of impacts from multiple crab species. There is also a need to identify additional factors that can affect crab populations. We sampled crabs and environmental parameters in four Rhode Island salt marshes in 2014 and compiled existing data to quantify trends in crab abundance and multiple factors that potentially affect crabs. Crab communities were dominated by fiddler and green crabs (Carcinus maenas); S. reticulatum was much less abundant. Burrow sizes suggest that Uca is responsible for most burrows. On the marsh platform, burrows and Carcinus abundance were negatively correlated with elevation, soil moisture, and soil percent organic matter and positively correlated with soil bulk density. Uca abundance was negatively correlated with Spartina patens cover and height and positively correlated with Spartina alterniflora cover and soil shear strength. Creekbank burrow density increased dramatically between 1998 and 2016. During the same time, fishing effort and the abundance of birds that prey on crabs decreased, and water levels increased. Unlike in other southern New England marshes where recreational overfishing is hypothesized to drive increasing marsh crab abundance, we propose that changes in crab abundance were likely unrelated to recreational finfish over-harvest; instead, they better track sea-level rise and changing abundances of alternate predators, such as birds. We predict that marsh crab abundance will continue to expand with ongoing sea-level rise, at least until inundation thresholds for crab survival are exceeded.

AB  - 1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation.
   2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing.
   3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation.
   4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential.
   5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.

AB  - Chemical associations of Zn, Pb, Cu, Co and Cd were determined using a sequential extraction procedure in sediments colonised by S. maritima in three salt marshes within the Tagus estuary: Rosario, Corroios and Pancas. Concentrations of these metals were also analysed in above- and belowground parts of Spartina maritima, as well as in sediments colonised by the plant. The highest metal concentrations in sediments were found in the marshes near the industrial and urban areas, whereas metal concentrations in plants were not significantly different among sites. This was thought to be a consequence of differences observed in metal bioavailability: Metals in Pancas, the least polluted location, were largely associated to easily accessible fractions for plant uptake, probably as a result of low organic matter content and high sandy fraction in sediments. S. maritima was able to induce the concentration of metals between its roots in the three salt marshes. The results obtained in this study indicate that S. maritima could be useful to induce phytostabilisation of metals in sediments, although the effectiveness to modify chemical associations is highly dependent on existing sediment parameters, and thus different results could be obtained depending on site characteristics.

AB  - The soil organic matter (SOM) extracted under different vegetation types from a Brazilian mangrove (Pai Matos Island, Sao Paulo State) and from three Spanish salt marshes (Betanzos Ria and Corrubedo Natural Parks, Galicia, and the Albufera Natural Park, Valencia) was investigated by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The chemical variation was larger in SOM from the Spanish marshes than in the SOM of the Brazilian mangroves, possibly because the marshes included sites with both tidal and nontidal variation, whereas the mangrove forest underwent just tidal variation. Thus, plant-derived organic matter was better preserved under permanently anoxic environments. Moreover, given the low number of studied profiles and sedimentary-vegetation sequences in both areas, depth trends remain unclear. The chemical data also allow distinction between the contributions of woody and nonwoody vegetation inputs. Soil organic matter decomposition was found to cause: (i) a decrease in lignin contents and a relative increase in aliphatics; (ii) an increase in short-chain aliphatics at the expense of longer ones; (iii) a loss of odd-over-even dominance in alkanes and alkenes; and (iv) an increase in microbial products, including proteins, sterols, short-chain fatty acids, and alkanes. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is a useful tool to study the behavior and composition of SOM in wetland environments such as mangroves and salt marshes. Additional profiles need to be studied for each vegetation type, however, to improve the interpretability of the chemical data.

AB  - Plant morphology plays important role in studying biogeography in many ecosystems. Suadea salsa, as a native plant community of northern China and an important habitat for diversity of waterbirds and macrobenthos, has often been overlooked. Nowadays, S. salsa community is facing great loss due to coastal reclamation activities and natural disturbances. To maintain and restore S. salsa community, it's important to address the plant morphology across marsh zones, as well as its relationships with local soil abiotic conditions. In our studied intertidal salt marsh, we found that less flood disturbance frequency, softer soil conditions, rich soil organic matter, total carbon and total nitrogen, lower water depth and water content, less species competition will benefit S. salsa plant in the morphology of high coverage, above-ground biomass, shoot height and leaf length. Lower soil porewater salinity will benefit the below-ground biomass of S. salsa. Thus, we recommend managers help alleviate soil abiotic stresses in the intertidal salt marshes, making the soil conditions more suitable for S. salsa growth and succession. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat patch composition and configuration mediate the fitness and distribution of many species. However, we know little about how this landscape complementation may influence the distribution of an invasive species' ecological impacts and, in turn, how this affects ecosystem resilience to disturbance. We surveyed > 820 km of coastline to evaluate how landscape complementation mediates patterns in invasive feral hog (Sus scrofa) rooting, trampling and wallowing disturbances in southeastern US salt marshes and assessed marsh resilience to these behaviors in an 8-site survey and 13-month field experiment. We discovered that hog rooting and trampling most often occur where hardwood forest comprises > 30% and salt marsh < 22% of habitat surrounding each surveyed site, respectively, while wallowing correlated most strongly with salt marsh invertebrate densities. At the 8 survey sites, vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, and surface elevation were consistently lower, and soil anoxia and porewater ammonium-nitrogen higher, in hog-disturbed relative to undisturbed areas. The experiment revealed that vegetation can recover when rooted or trampled, but remains depressed when wallowed or repeatedly disturbed. Together, these findings provide novel evidence that habitat patch composition at landscape scales can act together with local habitat attributes to dictate invasive species' disturbance patterns and highlight areas most vulnerable to invaders. In salt marshes, insights gleaned from such consideration of landscape complementation can inform conservation and management strategies for curbing the impact of this prolific, global invader.

AB  - The "Outwelling Theory" states that salt marshes play a major role in exporting production to adjacent estuarine and coastal ecosystems. However, it has been found that some marshes act as net importers instead of net exporters of organic matter and nutrients. Once we include mangroves and refine the analysis to comprehend bacterioplankton, organic and stable isotope tracers, the picture became, more complex, making room for a revival of the outwelling idea. The exchanges between the Castro Marim salt marsh and the main estuary were tentatively established determining periodically, in a selected cross-section, the concentrations of TSS, FSS, VSS, NH4, NO2, NO3, N-Kjeldhal, SiO4, PO4, TDP, Chlorophyll a and Pheopigments, measuring their fluxes along tidal cycles and computing the corresponding budgets. Apparently, the sedimentary behaviour of the marsh will be close to equilibrium during the period of study. However, it will import mainly inert matter and export mainly organic matter in the same period. Moreover, extrapolating these results to the entire Guadiana salt marshes, the exchanges of sediment do not seem to be significant. Particularly, the marshes will not trap a significantly amount sediment transported by the main river (0.5%). It also seems to follow, that in a general way, the Guadiana salt marshes might have a more significant role than was anticipated in the system economy of OM and nutrients and their outwelling to coastal waters, assuring outputs that could amount to something like 6% of the river load of N, 1.2% of the river load of P, and 20-57% of the river load of TOC, for an average year, and 42% of the river load of N and 35% of the river load of P in a dry year. These findings suggest that a more detailed investigation, over an extended period of time, is certainly worthwhile.

AB  - Denitrifying microbial communities and denitrification in salt marsh sediments may be affected by many factors, including environmental conditions, nutrient availability, and levels of pollutants. The objective of this study was to examine how microbial community composition and denitrification enzyme activities (DEA) at a California salt marsh with high nutrient loading vary with such factors. Sediments were sampled from three elevations, each with different inundation and vegetation patterns, across 12 stations representing various salinity and nutrient conditions. Analyses included determination of cell abundance, total and denitrifier community compositions (by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism), DEA, nutrients, and eluted metals. Total bacterial (16S rRNA) and denitrifier (nirS) community compositions and DEA were analyzed for their relationships to environmental variables and metal concentrations via multivariate direct gradient and regression analyses, respectively. Community composition and DEA were highly variable within the dynamic salt marsh system, but each was strongly affected by elevation (i.e., degree of inundation) and carbon content as well as by selected metals. Carbon content was highly related to elevation, and the relationships between DEA and carbon content were found to be elevation specific when evaluated across the entire marsh. There were also lateral gradients in the marsh, as evidenced by an even stronger association between community composition and elevation for a marsh subsystem. Lastly, though correlated with similar environmental factors and selected metals, denitrifier community composition and function appeared uncoupled in the marsh.

AB  - The persistence of coastal marsh is dependent on its ability to maintain elevation relative to sea level, particularly for marshes experiencing high rates of shoreline erosion due to wave-attack, storms, and sea level rise. Sediments eroded at the marsh edge are either delivered onto the marsh platform or into the estuary, the latter resulting in a net loss of marsh sediments and soil carbon. Knowledge on the timing, pattern, and quantity of sediment deposition versus shoreline erosion along the marsh-estuary interface is critical for evaluating the overall health and vulnerability of coastal marshes to future scenarios of sea level rise and for estimating sediment budgets. Here we examined marsh shoreline erosion and sediment deposition for marsh sites experiencing a range of shoreline erosion rates and different levels of wind-wave exposure within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and Wildlife Refuge in Mississippi. We developed a method for calculating an erosion-deposition sediment budget using marsh elevation profiles, shoreline erosion rate, and sediment deposition measurements. Sediment budgets were calculated at four sites with varying shoreline erosion rates. Much of the sediment eroded at the marsh edge can be accounted for as marsh platform deposition, except at the most erosive site, suggesting a possible erosion threshold where eroded sediment mass is greater than platform deposition. Consistent with other studies of marsh creeks, sediment delivery to the marsh platform appears to be largely driven by wave climate. These data suggest that for erosive bay-estuarine shorelines, sediment delivered into the marsh is largely concentrated near the marsh shoreline, although shoreline erosion does not always result in a net loss of sediments from the marsh system in either decadal or annual assessments.

AB  - Soils from two typical tidal salt marshes with varied salinity in the Yellow River Delta wetland were analysed to determine possible effects of salinity on soil carbon sequestration through changes in soil microbiology. The mean soil respiration (SR) of the salt water-fresh water mixing zone (MZ) was 2.89 times higher than that of the coastal zone (CZ) (4.73 and 1.63molm(-2)s(-1), respectively, p<.05), and soil dehydrogenase activity was the main microbial factor influencing SR. In addition to the higher soil microbial biomass, the MZ had more -Proteobacteria than the CZ, as well as some specific bacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity such as Pseudomonas sp. and Limnobacter sp. that might have led to its higher dehydrogenase activity and respiratory rates. Additionally, the CZ possessed more Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota with the ability to fix CO2 than the MZ. Significantly lower soil salinity in MZ (4.25gkg(-1)) was suitable for -Proteobacteria, but detrimental for Halobacteria compared with CZ (7.09gkg(-1), p<.01), which might lead to the lower microbial decomposition capacity of soils in CZ. As a result, the CZ has a higher soil organic carbon content than the MZ.

AB  - Mercury contamination in Canada's Bay of Fundy is a priority concern because of elevated levels observed in fish, birds and wildlife. Salt marshes constitute an important part of the Bay's coastline and are potential stores of mercury for the region. We measured the amount of mercury accumulated over a 5-yr period from 1997 to 2002 in surface sediments of seven salt marshes along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay. The seven study sites extended from outer to inner Bay, spanning a gradient in tidal range (6-12 m) and sediment characteristics such as %LOI (4-29%) and sediment deposition rate (0.27-1.76 cm yr(-1)). In each study site, mercury was measured in low and high marsh areas. Sediment mercury concentrations ranged from 7 to 79 ng g(-1) and loading rates ranged from 0.1 to 1 mg m(-2). Total estimated 5-yr storage of mercury in salt marsh sediments of the Bay is 854 +/- 465 kg. We also compared sediment mercury loading to atmospheric inputs measured at a deposition monitoring station operating in New Brunswick from 1997 to 2002 and found that direct atmospheric deposition appears to be a minor input of mercury to these sediments. We are unaware of documentation of mercury loading in salt marshes on a bay-wide scale and over a constrained (5-yr) time period elsewhere. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Impounded tidal conditions often compromise coastal marsh restoration goals, through vegetation loss and other biogeochemical feedbacks. To determine if episodic marsh impoundments could be partially responsible for the observed cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) dieback at Crissy Field, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, we examined sulfur chemistry and plant stress along transects between and during tidal inlet closure events from 2007 to 2008. During closures, porewater sulfide (PW S2-) concentrations did not respond consistently among sites, nor did they increase to levels likely to cause stress damage to cordgrass (>1 mM). However, sediment solid-phase total reduced sulfur (TRS) concentrations did respond strongly to closures both at surface and subsurface depth intervals, and they were greatest in sites with high organic matter content (>5%). The temporal patterns of both PW S2- and TRS suggest that while sulfate reduction may be enhanced during closure events, the free sulfide produced is largely precipitated into solid-phase minerals. Even without millimolar levels of PW S2-, plant stress was observed during closures, as indicated by a buildup of ethanol in root tissues, a by-product of fermentative respiration brought on by limited oxygen availability. Further, enhanced sulfate reduction may be related to the higher relative concentrations of methylmercury in low intertidal surface sediments observed during closure events. These data suggest that, in support of vegetated tidal marsh restoration goals, tidal flows should be maintained actively to reduce the impact of impoundment events on marsh biogeochemistry and productivity.

AB  - Along the mid- and north Atlantic coasts of the USA, over 90 % of salt marshes have been ditched. Ditching was largely abandoned by the mid-twentieth century; however, techniques that create permanent shallow water pools for mosquito control and bird habitat are increasingly being applied to marshes of the USA and elsewhere. Salt marshes in Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, and Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were used to examine differences between areas that have been ditched and those altered to increase the density of shallow pools in water table dynamics, salinity, soil and porewater chemistry, as well as short-term sedimentation, accretion, and elevation change rates. We found that the area with plugged ditches, berms, and pools in Plum Island had less drainage, higher salinity and porewater sulfide and ammonium concentrations, and higher soil organic matter than the adjacent ditched area. Despite averaging 8 cm lower in elevation, the Plum Island ditched area had less sediment deposition and was composed of higher elevation plant species than the area with plugged ditches, berms, and shallow pools. Elevation increased in the ditched area at a rate of 3.2 +/- A 0.5 mm/year, but elevation change was variable in the area with pools. In Barnegat Bay, the marsh area with pools and ditches had less sediment deposition and surface accretion than the ditch-only area, associated, in part, with the higher elevation. An average elevation difference of 4.5 cm was associated with a sixfold difference in mineral sediment deposition. Temporal sediment deposition and surface accretion was important in the ditch-only area but was absent or muted in the area with numerous pools. Elevation increased in both marsh areas at an average rate of 1.8 +/- A 0.8 mm/year, less than half the long-term average local rate of sea-level rise. Our results illustrate how physical manipulations including changes to tidal hydrology and surface topography interact with elevation to influence short-term biophysical feedbacks.

AB  - In places where tidal marshes were formerly embanked for agricultural land use, these marshes are nowadays increasingly restored with the aim to regain important ecosystem services. However, there is growing evidence that restored tidal marshes and their services develop slowly and differ from natural tidal marshes in many aspects. Here we focus on groundwater dynamics, because these affect several key ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and vegetation development. We hypothesize that groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are reduced as compared to natural marshes because of the difference in soil structure. In the macro-tidal Schelde estuary (Belgium), in both a natural and a restored (since 2006) freshwater tidal marsh, we measured depth profiles of soil properties (grain size distribution, LOI (loss on ignition), moisture content and bulk density) and temporal dynamics of groundwater levels along a transect with increasing distance from a tidal creek. X-ray micro CT-scanning was used to quantify soil macroporosity. The restored marsh has a two layered soil stratigraphy with a topsoil of freshly accreted sediment (ranging in depth between 10 and 60 cm, deposited since 2006) and a subsoil of compact relict agricultural soil. We found that both the soil in the natural marsh and the topsoil of the restored marsh consist of loosely packed sediment rich in macropores and organic matter, whereas the relict agricultural soil in the restored marsh is densely packed and has few macropores. Our results show that groundwater level fluctuations in the restored marsh are restricted to the top layer of newly deposited sediment (i.e. on average 0.08 m depth). Groundwater level fluctuations in the natural marsh occur over a larger depth of the soil profile (i.e. on average 0.28 m depth). As a consequence, the reduced groundwater dynamics in restored tidal marshes are expected to alter the subsurface fluxes of water and nutrients, the source sink function and the development of marsh vegetation.

AB  - Salt marshes created on dredge spoil were compared to natural marshes to evaluate the capacity of created marshes to perform carbon cycle functions. Several carbon cycle attributes were measured in eight created Spartina alterniflora Loisel salt marshes that ranged from one to 28 years, each paired with a nearby mature natural reference marsh. The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years. There was some evidence that ecosystem gas exchange in created marshes developed slightly faster than aboveground biomass production. Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes. However, carbon mineralization rates per gram soil were relatively low in the created marshes due to lower soil organic matter content. With proper construction, we suggest most major carbon fluxes can be established in created salt marshes in less than five years.

AB  - Lignin oxidation products, delta C-13 values, C/N ratios and particle size were used to investigate the sources, distribution and chemical stability of sedimentary organic matter (OM) along the Andong salt marsh located in the southwestern end of Hangzhou Bay, China. Terrestrial OM was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial OM with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary OM in the Spartina altemiflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial OM in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial OM input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial OM from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Louisiana, plant production rates and associated decomposition rates may be important in offsetting high rates of land loss and subsidence in organic marsh soils. Decomposition of Spartina patens shoot and leaf material was studied by using litter bags in mesohaline marshes in the Barataria and Terrebonne basins of coastal Louisiana. Spartina patens decomposed very slowly with an average decay constant of 0.0007, and approximately 50% of the material remained after 2 years in the held. Material at the Barataria site decomposed faster than did Terrebonne material with trend differences apparent during the first 150 days. This difference might be explained by the higher content of phosphorus in the Barataria material or a flooding period experienced by the Barataria bags during their first 10 days of deployment. Nitrogen and carbon content of the plant material studied did not differ between the two basins. We detected no consistent significant differences in decomposition above, at, or below sediment/water level. Because S. patens is the dominant plant in these marshes, and because it is so slow to decompose, we believe that S. patens shoots are an important addition to vertical accretion and, therefore, marsh elevation.

AB  - Wetlands export chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to estuaries, where CDOM is removed and transformed through biotic and abiotic process, subsequently impacting nutrient cycling, light availability, ecosystem metabolism, and phytoplankton activity. We examined the bioavailability and photoreactivity of CDOM exported from four Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes across three seasons and along an estuarine salinity gradient using three incubation treatments: 14-day microbial (MD), 7-day combined photochemical/microbial (PB + MD), and 7-day microbial incubation after photobleaching (MD after PB). CDOM absorption at 300 nm (a(CDOM)300) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations showed strong seasonality, with minima in winter, but CDOM quality (absorption spectral slopes, fluorescence component ratios) was less variable seasonally. PB + MD over 7 days decreased a(CDOM)300 (-56.0%), humic-like fluorescence (-67.6%), and DOC (-17.8%), but increased the spectral slope ratio S-R (=S275-295/S300-350) (+94.8%), suggesting a decrease in CDOM molecular weight. Photochemistry dominated the PB + MD treatment. Photoreactivity was greater during the winter and in marsh/watershed versus down-estuary sites, likely due to less previous light exposure. Prior photobleaching increased the bioavailability of marsh-exported CDOM, resulting in a greater loss of a(CDOM)300 and DOC, and a greater increase in humic-like fluorescence (-6.0%, -5.9%, and +18.4% change, respectively, over 7-day MD after PB incubations, vs. -2.8%, -5.5%, and +2.6% change, respectively, over 14-day MD incubations). CDOM exported from a marsh downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant showed the greatest photoreactivity and bioavailability. This highlights the significance of human activity on estuarine CDOM quality and biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Fluorescence was used to examine the quality of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) exchanging between a tidal creek in a created salt marsh and its adjacent estuary in eastern North Carolina, USA. Samples from the creek were collected hourly over four tidal cycles in May, July, August, and October 2011. Absorbance and fluorescence of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and of base-extracted POM (BEPOM) served as the tracers for organic matter quality while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and base-extracted particulate organic carbon (BEPOC) were used to compute fluxes. Fluorescence was modeled using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and principle components analysis (PCA) of the PARAFAC results. Of nine PARAFAC components (C) modeled, C3 represented recalcitrant DOM and C4 represented fresher soil-derived source DOM. Component 1 represented detrital POM, and C6 represented planktonic POM. Based on mass balance, recalcitrant DOC export was 86gCm(-2)yr(-1) and labile DOC export was 49gCm(-2)yr(-1); no planktonic DOC was exported. The marsh also exported 41gCm(-2)yr(-1) of detrital terrestrial POC, which likely originated from lands adjacent to the North River estuary. Planktonic POC export from the marsh was 6gCm(-2)yr(-1). Assuming the exported organic matter was oxidized to CO2 and scaled up to global salt marsh area, respiration of salt marsh DOC and POC transported to estuaries could amount to a global CO2 flux of 11TgCyr(-1), roughly 4% of the recently estimated CO2 release for marshes and estuaries globally.

AB  - Sulfate reduction and its associated contaminant immobilization in marsh soils supporting a phosphogypsum stack was examined by pore-water and solid analysis, selective extractions, microscopy and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The negative impact of this stack on estuarine environments is a concerning problem. In the weathering profile, total concentrations of most pollutants increase with depth; instead, dissolved contents in pore-waters increase to middle of the saturated zone but then decrease drastically down to reach the marsh due to sulfide precipitation. Excess of acid-volatile sulfide plus pyritic sulfur over metals bound to the oxidizable fraction indicates that sulfide precipitation is the main mechanism responsible for metal removal in the marsh. Thus, abundant pyrite occurred as framboidal grains, in addition to other minor sulfides of As, Zn and Cu as isolated particles. Moreover, high contents of elemental sulfur were found, which suggest partial sulfide oxidation, but marsh may have capacity to buffer potential release of contaminants. The importance of sulfur species was quantitatively confirmed by XANES, which also supports the accuracy of selective extraction schemes. Accordingly, managing pore-water quality through organic carbon-rich amendments over phosphogypsum stacks could lead to a decrease in contaminant loading of leakages resulting from weathering.

AB  - Fate and effects of the macro nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and the heavy metals zinc, copper and cadmium, brought into experimental salt marsh ecosystems via sediment supply, were studied over a three-year period.
   The supply of sediment from the Marsdiep (at a low and high rate) and from the harbour of Delfzijl (at a high rate) led to an increase of the macro nutrients and heavy metals in the top soil. The growth of the salt marsh plants Aster tripolium, Puccinellia maritima and Spartina anglica and the uptake of the macro nutrients and heavy, metals by the plants was only slightly affected by the addition of sediment. A high load of sediment led to an increase in growth or in the concentrations of the macro nutrients or heavy metals iii the plants at a number of sampling dates, but only minor differences between treatments were found.
   From a mass balance constructed over a three-year study period it could be concluded that about 50% of the macro nutrients and heavy metals were retained in the salt marsh sediment. This was equal to the retained amount of organic matter, indicating that retention of the elements was closely related to retention of organic matter. The 50% loss of the macro nutrients and heavy metals probably occurred via ebb tides after resuspension of sediment and organic matter. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Halimione portulacoides, on the composition of the sedimentary humic acids was evaluated. For this purpose, cores of colonized and non-colonized sediments from a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) were collected, and the humic acids of different layers were extracted and characterized by Fourier transform infrared, synchronous molecular fluorescence (Deltalambda = 60 nm) and UV-visible spectroscopies and also by elemental analysis. The infrared spectra suggest the presence of more peptide residues and carbohydrates in the sedimentary humic acids from surface and around the plant roots at the site colonized by H. portulacoides, when compared with the humic acids from the depth-equivalent sediment layers at the non-colonized site. The higher content of protein-type materials is confirmed by the lowest values of C/N ratios and the highest relative intensities of a band at lambda(exc) = 280 nm in the fluorescence spectra. The lowest epsilon(280) values obtained in the UV-visible spectra, and the infrared spectra suggest a lower aromatic content of the humic acids from the colonized site.

AB  - To characterize chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marsh porewaters and its contribution as a carbon source, optical properties (absorbance, fluorescence indices, 3-dimensional excitation-emission matrices [EEMs]) of soil porewater and surface water were measured in a southern Californian salt marsh. Absorption coefficients and fluorescence intensities were higher in porewater than in overlying surface waters, consistent with higher CDOM concentration at depth. Humic-type peaks A and C were observed in EEMs in all samples, and peak M was observed in surface waters and shallow porewater to -5 cm depth. Fluorescence: absorbance (flu:abs) ratios and spectral slopes (S) decreased across the surface interface, and emission peak maxima were red-shifted-changes that are consistent with increasing molecular weight (MW) and aromaticity in soil porewater due to humification, and lower-MW, less aromatic material in oxic surface waters from oxidative photochemical and biological processing. At lower depths, bands were observed where intensity, flu: abs ratios and S increased; absorption coefficients decreased; emission maxima for humic-type peaks were blue-shifted; and tryptophan-type protein peaks were observed. These changes are consistent with lower-MW and less aromatic material from enhanced microbial activity. Variations in iron concentrations and sulfate depletion with depth were consistent with these bands having different dominant anaerobic microbial metabolic pathways. Overall, optical property trends suggest that soil porewater is a reservoir of CDOM in the salt marsh, with organic material from terrestrial watershed inputs and in situ production from marsh vegetation stored and processed in sediments.

AB  - Short sediment cores (up to 44 cm long) taken from salt marshes regenerated during the last 60 years in the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve have been interpreted on the basis of microfaunal and geochemical determinations and historical data. Agricultural soils in the middle and upper estuary reaches were abandoned during the 1950s and entrance of estuarine water provoked a rapid natural environmental transformation of these anthropogenic areas. Increasing amounts of sand and benthic foraminifera were deposited at a very high sedimentation rate (average 16 mm yr(-1)) during the 1950s and 1960s allowing well developed regenerated salt marshes to be rapidly established in these formerly occupied areas. During recent decades much lower sedimentation rates (average 2.5 mm yr(-1)), abundant agglutinated foraminiferal assemblages and enrichment of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cr) due to industrialization are characteristic of these already regenerated environments. This rapid regeneration process (less than 10 years) is of great interest for environmental management of modern coastal zones where extensive reclaimed land could be easily restored to tidal wetlands under the current scenario of accelerating sea-level rise.

AB  - Blue carbon habitats like salt marshes and mangroves bury large amounts of carbon with limited area; however, they also are increasingly susceptible to current climate change. Combined effects of rising temperatures, decreasing freeze frequencies, and increasing sea level rise rates are resulting in mangrove replacement of salt marshes along the southern United States. Surface soils analyzed here from wetlands along northern Florida Atlantic and Gulf Coasts showed higher apparent sedimentation rates in mangrove-dominated sites (1.5-3.2 mm yr(-1)) and where mangroves are migrating into the marsh (termed transition sites, 2.3-3.8 mm yr(-1)). Average carbon burial rates were higher in transition sites for both coasts (27-47 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) compared to the respective mangrove (10-22 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) and salt marsh (4-7 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) sites. Lignin biomarker data (?-6, ?-8, and C/V) indicated that mangrove and transition sites had higher lignin inputs from woody vascular plants compared to salt marsh sites, which may slow decadal- to centennial-scale decay. Higher amino acid concentrations in mangrove soils relative to mangrove biomass (1.8-2.3 mmol g C-1 vs. 0.2-0.9 mmol g C-1) and lower C/N indicated that these mangrove sites receive higher algal inputs than the transition and salt marsh sites, attributed to greater tidal inundation in the mangrove sites given their position near the shoreline. Overall, increased accretion, carbon burial, and lignin in mangrove transition sites indicate that this migration may increase carbon burial and increase the stability and residence time of buried soil carbon. Future studies on mangrove migration in northern Florida can verify this through replication and elevation analysis.

AB  - The amount of ecological restoration required to mitigate or compensate for environmental injury or habitat loss is often based on the goal of achieving ecological equivalence. However, few tools are available for estimating the extent of restoration required to achieve habitat services equivalent to those that were lost. This paper describes habitat equivalency analysis (HEA), a habitat-based "service-to-service" approach for determining the amount of restoration needed to compensate for natural resource losses, and examines issues in its application in the case of salt marsh restoration. The scientific literature indicates that although structural attributes such as vegetation may recover within a few years, there is often a significant lag in the development of ecological processes such as nutrient cycling that are necessary for a fully functioning salt marsh. Moreover, natural variation can make recovery trajectories difficult to define and predict for many habitat services. HEA is an excellent tool for scaling restoration actions because it reflects this ecologicol variability and complexity, At the same time, practitioners must recognize that conclusions about the amount of restoration needed to provide ecological services equivalent to those that are lost will depend critically on the ecological data and assumptions that are used in the HEA calculation.

AB  - The EUROpean SAlt marshes Modelling (EUROSAM) project is part of the Thematic Network European Land-Ocean Interaction Studies programme. The main aims of the EUROSAM project were to fill in some of the main gaps in the understanding of ecological processes, to integrate this knowledge into models to predict the likely response of salt marsh ecosystems to environmental changes, and to make the knowledge available to decision-makers. Research work and model development for the project were carried out by researchers in France, Portugal, the Netherlands, and England, and included studies on sediment dynamics and interactions with vegetation, plant population dynamics and genetics, models of organic matter production and cycling, studies of animal communities, food webs and organic matter fluxes, and development of hydrodynamic models at different scales: salt marsh, bay, and estuary.
   This paper describes the main aims and outputs of the EUROSAM project, and the incorporation of the findings and models into a prototype Decision Support System (DSS). The EUROSAM DSS is designed as a guide for the nonspecialist to understand the important role and functioning of salt marshes, and for use as a management tool. Example scenarios were selected from the work within the project to illustrate the interactions between components of the salt marsh-mudflat ecosystem, and the potential impact of human activities and environmental change on the salt marsh system.

AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple 'ecosystem services' in coastal waters, including carbon sequestration. However, this 'Blue Carbon' potential has been only evaluated for certain species from some areas of the world. In this study, we provide initial estimates on the magnitude and local variability of carbon sequestration, as organic carbon stocks, for seagrass meadows of Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Ascherson in the oceanic island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain, central-eastern Atlantic). Six seagrass meadows were selected; at each meadow, cores inserted up to 30 cm in the seabed were collected in the 'interior', 'edge' and 'unvegetated' bottoms immediately adjacent to seagrass patches. We estimated organic carbon (Cara) pools by means of the Loss of Ignition (LOI) procedure. Overall, larger C-org pools were observed in the 'interior' and 'edges' of meadow patches than in adjacent 'unvegetated' bottoms. At the meadow-level, C-org pools were not predicted neither by the meadow area, nor by the mean shoot density, or sediment grain fractions. Overall, the total estimated stock was 86.20 +/- 19.06 Mg C ha(-1). By considering the total potential extension of seagrass meadows across the entire island perimeter, we estimated a total stock of 60.34 Gg of C, for a mean estimated financial value of 919,432.249 (sic) (1313.47 (sic) ha(-1)), which ranges between 351,631.35 (sic) (502.33 (sic) ha(-1)) and 1,498,954.45 (sic) (2141.36 (sic) ha(-1)), according to varying market prices in the last 5 years. This work highlights, therefore, the importance of meadows underpinned by C. nodosa not only at an ecological, but also at an economic level, in particular from the perspective of regional climate change adaptation strategies.

AB  - The importance of intertidal estuarine habitats, like salt marsh and oyster reef, has been well established, as has their ubiquitous loss along our coasts with resultant forfeiture of the ecosystem services they provide. Furthering our understanding of how these habitats are evolving in the face of anthropogenic and climate driven changes will help improve management strategies. Previous work has shown that the growth and productivity of both oyster reefs and salt marshes are strongly linked to elevation in the intertidal zone (duration of aerial exposure). We build on that research by examining the growth of marsh-fringing oyster reefs at yearly to decadal time scales and examine movement of the boundary between oyster reef and salt marsh at decadal to centennial time scales. We show that the growth of marsh-fringing reefs is strongly associated to the duration of aerial exposure, with little growth occurring below mean low water and above mean sea level. Marsh-shoreline movement, in the presence or absence of fringing oyster reefs, was reconstructed using transects of sediment cores. Carbonaceous marsh sediments sampled below the modern fringing oyster reefs indicate that marsh shorelines within Back Sound, North Carolina are predominantly in a state of transgression (landward retreat), and modern oyster-reef locations were previously occupied by salt marsh within the past two centuries. Cores fronting transgressive marsh shorelines absent fringing reefs sampled thinner and less extensive carbonaceous marsh sediment than at sites with fringing reefs. This indicates that fringing reefs are preserving carbonaceous marsh sediment from total erosion as they transgress and colonize the exposed marsh shoreline making marsh sediments more resistant to erosion. The amount of marsh sediment preservation underneath the reef scales with the reef's relief, as reefs with the greatest relief were level with the marsh platform, preserving a maximum amount of carbonaceous sediments during transgression by buffering the marsh from erosional processes. Thus, fringing oyster reefs not only have the capacity to shelter shorelines but, if located at the ideal tidal elevation, they also keep up with accelerating sea-level rise and cap carbonaceous sediments, protecting them from erosion, as reefs develop along the marsh.

AB  - Low-lying barrier islands present ideal locations to investigate hydrogeochemical processes in sandy coastal aquifers, as they (i) host typical geographic features of the coast, including beaches, dunes, as well as salt marshes, (ii) are susceptible to the impacts of a global climate change, because of their low surface elevations, and (iii) are ubiquitous (>2,100) amongst the global coastlines. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogeochemical patterns in near-surface groundwater on developing barrier islands, using the Ostplate on Spiekeroog Island, Germany, as an example. The impact of inundation, season and vegetation on the hydrogeochemical processes were of particular interest. Six groundwater monitoring wells were installed for this purpose, covering main geographic features of the Ostplate, i.e., supratidal beaches, dunes and salt marshes. Groundwater samples were collected bimonthly from April 2016 to March 2017. Measured parameters included major ions, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon/matter (DOC/DOM), delta C-13 signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as delta S-34 signatures of dissolved sulfate and sulfide. We found major ion compositions to be a function of the annual flooding frequency, although cation concentrations were further impacted by calcite dissolution and cation exchange. The redox chemistry varied at the different sites and through seasons. Aerobic respiration was the dominant pathway for carbon oxidation at the dune locations, whereas organic matter mineralization in the salt marsh was also mediated by anaerobic processes. Regarding electron donors, the presence of labile DOM was linked to salinity, and terrestrial DOM signatures as well as gross inputs of organic carbon agreed with vegetation patterns. A physico-chemical interpretation of the pore water compositions revealed a potential for the authigenic formation of carbonate and phosphate minerals in the investigated sediments, triggered by the redox processes.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to understand the role different salt marsh plants on metal distribution and retention in the Lima River estuary (NW Portugal), which to our knowledge have not been ascertained in this area yet. The knowledge of these differences is an important requirement for the development of appropriate management strategies, and is poorly described for Eurosiberian estuaries, like the one selected. In addition it is important to understand the difference among introduced and native salt marsh plants. In this work, metal levels (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were surveyed (by atomic absorption spectrometry) in sediments from sites vegetated with Juncus maritimus, Spartina patens, Phragmites australis and Triglochin striata (rhizo-sediments), in non-vegetated sediments and in the different tissues of the plants (roots, rhizomes and aerial shoots). In general, rhizo-sediments had higher metal concentrations than non-vegetated sediments, a feature that seems common to sediments colonized by salt marsh plants of different estuarine areas. All plants concentrated metals, at least Cd, Cu and Zn (and Pb for T. striata) in their belowground structures ([M](belowground tissues)/[M](non-vegetated) (sediment) > 1). However, when considered per unit of salt marsh area, the different selected plants played a different role on sediment metal distribution and retention. Triglochin striata retained a significant metal burden in it belowground structures (root plus rhizomes) acting like a possible phyto-stabilizer, whereas P. australis had an higher metal burden in aboveground tissues acting as a possible phyto-extractor. As for J. maritimus and S. patens, metal burden distribution between above and belowground structures depended on the metal, with J. maritimus retaining, for instance, much more Cd and Cu in the aboveground than in the belowground structures. Therefore, the presence of invasive and exotic plants in some areas of the salt marsh may considerably affect metal distribution and retention in the estuarine region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coastal marshes have a significant capacity to sequester carbon; however, sea-level rise (SLR) is expected to result in prolonged flooding and saltwater intrusion in coastal regions. To explore the effects of SLR projections on net CO2 uptake in coastal marshes, we conducted a "double-check" investigation, including the eddy covariance (EC) measurements of the CO2 fluxes in subtropical coastal marshes along inundation and salinity gradients, in combination with a mesocosm experiment for analyzing CO2 flux components under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. During the same measurement periods, the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEEEC based on the EC dataset) in an oligohaline marsh was higher than that in a low-elevation mesohaline marsh, whereas the NEEEC was lower than that in a high-elevation freshwater marsh. The declines in NEEEC between the marshes could be attributed to a greater decrease in gross primary production relative to ecosystem respiration. Waterlogging slightly increased the NEEms (NEE based on the mesocosms) because of inhibited soil respiration and slight changes in plant photosynthesis and shoot respiration. However, the NEEms measured during the drainage period decreased significantly due to the stimulated soil respiration. The NEEms decreased with increasing salinity (except under mild salinity), and waterlogging exacerbated the adverse impacts of salinity. The amplificatory effect of decreases in both leaf photosynthesis and growth under hydrological stresses contributed more to reduce the NEEms than to respiratory effluxes. Both water logging and increased salinity reduced the root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and activities of assayed soil enzymes (except for cellulase under waterlogging conditions), leading to limited soil respiration. The declines in plant growth, photosynthesis, and soil respiration could also be attributed to the decrease in soil nutrients under waterlogging and increased salinity conditions. We propose that the coupling of SLR-driven hydrological effects lowers the capacity of CO2 uptake in subtropical coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many tidal marsh surfaces feature water-filled depressions, known as salt pans (shallow) or ponds (deeper). In the great Marshes at Barnstable, Cape God, pond formation is an active process. We hypothesize that degradation of organic matter by sulphate-reducing bacteria in these peat-rich marsh deposits is the primary cause of pan and pond formation. Sulphate reduction below an actively developing pond is probably enhanced by higher temperature and salinity of the pond water. Computer simulation suggests that ponds with similar characteristics to those in the Barnstable marshes may develop by sulphate reduction. Necessary conditions are sufficiently deep percolation and diffusion of sulphate into the underlying marsh deposits, and a high decomposition rate stimulated by high water temperatures in the ponds. In areas with a high density of ponds, drainage of the ponds by headward erosion of tidal creeks may cause rapid disintegration of the marsh surface. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The rapid expansion of Spartina alterniflora, exogenous nitrogen (N) input and climate change in the coastal wetlands in the east of China may interactively affect soil N mineralization in costal salt marshes. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted with two exogenous N forms (NO3--N and NH4+-N), six temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three plant marshes (the invasive S. alterniflora and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) to investigate these interactive effects on soil net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate in coastal wetlands. The averaged rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification over incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C were significantly higher in the S. alterniflora marsh than in the S. salsa and P. australis marshes. The differences in N mineralization and nitrification among the tested soils were closely related with soil properties. With the addition of NO3--N, net N mineralization and nitrification were increased in the studied soils by 16-29% and 34-54%, respectively, whereas with the addition of NH4+N, they were increased by 58-69% and 65-94%, respectively. Net mineralization and nitrification in the tested soils increased with incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C regardless of N addition. However, N addition (either NH4+N or NO3--N) not only dramatically raised the sensitivity of net N mineralization in the S. alterniflora marsh to temperature fluctuation, but also remarkably enhanced the percentage of net nitrification in net mineralization at incubation temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C, with peak values at 25 degrees C for all studied soils. These results suggest that under a changing climate, N supplying capacity of the S. alterniflora soil, as well as N pool, is notably great, which may shed light on the mechanism of rapid expansion of S. alterniflora in coastal China.

AB  - Plant invasion can strongly influence carbon (C) cycling processes, thus it may affect climate change by altering C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in the invaded ecosystem. Since 1979, the exotic Spartina alterniflora has rapidly expanded in China's coastal areas, where significant increase in methane (CH4) emissions has been documented from post-invaded sites. However, a mechanistic understanding of the structural and functional changes of associated methanogens accompanying this invasion remains elusive.
   Here we conducted integrated biogeochemical investigations on methanogenic substrates, activity, and diversity to identify implications of S. alterniflora invasion for methanogenesis in coastal wetlands. To do this, we collected and analysed 0-50cm soil profiles from an uncolonised tidal flat (TF) and salt marshes that S. alterniflora has invaded for 1year (SA-1) and 12years (SA-12) in Jiangsu, China. Methanogenic community composition was characterised by massive parallel sequencing. The rates and pathways of methanogenesis were determined by adding trace concentrations of C-13-labelled substrates to anaerobic incubated samples.
   Our results revealed that 12-year invasion of S.alterniflora drastically increased CH4 production potential by one order of magnitude over that of TF. This substantial increase was primarily attributed to methanogenesis from trimethylamine; its rates increased by two orders of magnitude over TF whereas those from acetate and H-2/CO2 increased far less. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway operating in the TF, but methanotrophic pathway contributed most to CH4 production in the surface layer of SA-1 and uppermost 40-cm layers of SA-12. Consistent with these observations, the dominant methanogens shifted from obligate hydrogenotrophic Methanococcales in TF to potential methylamine-utilising Methanosarcinaceaein SA-12. Our Mantel analysis indicated that non-competitive' trimethylamine, derived from cytoplasmic osmolytes of S. alterniflora, was the major driver of this change in methanogenic community composition.
   Synthesis. Our results suggest that invasive Spartina alternifloraplants gradually facilitated the local dominance of methylotrophic Methanosarcinaceae by changing the key type of methanogenic substrate in coastal marshes. Shifts in methanogen communities and enhanced availability of trimethylamine elevated the rates and importance of methylotrophic methanogenesis, thereby markedly increasing CH4 production potential and emission rates in this type of ecosystem.

AB  - We investigated use of delta C-13 in bulk organic sediment to define the botanical origin of samples preserved in coastal sediment as a means to reconstruct relative sea level in New Jersey, USA. Modern transects at three sites demonstrated that low and high salt-marsh floral zones dominated by C-4 species (Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens) were associated with sediment delta C-13 values between -18.9 parts per thousand and -15.8 parts per thousand and occurred from mean tide level (MTL) to mean higher high water (MHHW). Brackish transitional settings vegetated by Phragmites australis with Iva fructescens and Typha sp. (C-3 species) and freshwater upland samples (C-3 species) were characterized by bulk sediment delta C-13 values of -27.0 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand and existed above MHHW. Parallel transects at one site suggested that intra-site variability was not discernible. The utility of delta C-13 values for reconstructing relative sea level in New Jersey is limited by an inability to differentiate between brackish sediments related to sea level and freshwater upland samples. To facilitate this distinction in a 4.4 m core, we used a multi-proxy approach (delta C-13 values with presence or absence of agglutinated foraminifera) to recognize indicative meanings for four sample types. Sediment with delta C-13 values greater than -18.9 parts per thousand was derived from a vegetated salt-marsh and formed between MTL and MHHW. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and containing agglutinated foraminifera formed in a brackish transitional zone between MHHW and highest astronomical tide (HAT). This is the narrowest elevational range of the four sample types and most precise sea-level indicator. Sediment with delta C-13 values less than -22.0 parts per thousand and lacking foraminifera can only constrain the upper bound of former sea level. Samples with intermediate values (-22.0 parts per thousand to -18.9 parts per thousand) formed between MTL and HAT. Using these indicative meanings and radiocarbon dates, we suggest that a transition from brackish to salt-marsh delta C-13 values recorded in the core took approximately 350 years (from 1800 to 1450 cal. a BP).

AB  - Crabs live at high densities in intertidal zones with various halophytes in salt marshes. However, the ecological relationships between crabs and halophytes as well as the impacts of herbivorous crabs on the plant distribution are not fully understood. In this study, we identified halophytic plant species consumed by crabs and determined the relative contributions of halophytes and other food sources to the diet. A DNA analysis of stomach contents was used to determine plant food sources for crabs. We found that the dominant crab species Helice tientsinensis consumed Suaeda japonica, even though several halophytes inhabited the study site. These results indicated that H. tientsinensis is a selective feeder. Based on a stable isotope analysis, we observed a dietary shift during crab development. Immature individuals mainly ate soil organic matter, whereas mature individuals showed more diverse food sources. We observed greater plant (S. japonica) consumption by middle-sized crabs than by crabs of other sizes. Our results for the feeding relationship between crabs and plants extend our understanding of the benthic food web in salt marshes.

AB  - The variation in plant species abundances and in community composition appears to be a basic ecological trigger that determines changes in community functionality and resilience. Particularly, fluctuations in abundance of dominant species might indicate major changes in resource use and ecosystem functioning. Here we use quantitative surveys of Baltic brackish and salt marsh plant communities to infer how variability in species abundances and environmental conditions influence plant assimilation rates and whether compensatory effects in abundance mask variability in functionality. The variability in species richness and assimilation rates was negatively correlated with average soil organic matter content and moisture and positively correlated with soil pH. It was independent of the variability in soil conditions. The abundances of rare species and species of intermediate abundances increased with increasing community wide assimilation rates. Our findings indicate that the strength of compensatory mechanisms that stabilise assimilation rates in salt marsh environments heavily depend on soil conditions. In the present study sites benign soil conditions stabilized assimilation rates while more stressful conditions caused synchronous fluctuations in total abundance and assimilation.

AB  - The salt marsh grass Distichlis spicata was regenerated from tissue culture and propagated in a greenhouse. Selected regenerants, along with selections from six wild populations, were grown for two years in a common garden flood-irrigated thrice weekly with tidal creek water. Selected wild and regenerated plants were also planted in a created salt marsh. Significant differences among regenerant and wild population selections were found in several functionally important salt marsh plant characteristics, including potential detritus production, belowground organic matter production, canopy structure, and decomposition rate. A combination of characteristics not found in the wild populations was evident in a regenerated line that exhibited both a high detritus production potential and a high decomposition rate. The amount of variation that occurred among regenerants from one parental line via somaclonal variation was similar to that which occurred among the wild population selections. Results of this study suggest that tissue culture may provide a means of producing marsh grasses with specific characteristics for directing the functional development of newly created salt marshes.

AB  - Temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) is important to reveal carbon decomposition responding to climate change. It's remains limited to understand how Q(10) of anaerobic soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is regulated by soil property in various wetlands with distinct hydrological characteristics. In the present study, samples of soil at the depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm were collected in three typical Phragmites australis marshes, including a freshwater marsh (FPa), a no-tidal salt marsh (NTPa) and a tidal salt marsh (TPa), in the Yellow River estuary. The soil samples were incubated at 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively, to determine the rates of anaerobic CO2 production, Q(10) values, and their relations to soil properties. Over 70-d incubation, temperature rise significantly increased the mean rates by 70%-136% (from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C) and 64%-142% (from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) among the marshes, with the mean Q(10) values ranging from 1.61 to 2.66. The rates of CO2 production and Q(10) values were significantly affected by wetland type and soil depth. Among marshes, the Q(10) of the FPa and NTPa soils was higher than that of the TPa soil (for 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm but for 20-30 cm); along soil depths, the Q(10) of the top soil was higher than that of the subsoil (for FPa and NTPa but for TPa). Q(10) was affected by total organic carbon (TOC), salinity and pH, and the effects were different with marshes. TOC was a main factor regulating Q(10) for the freshwater and the no-tidal salt marshes, while salinity and pH were main factors for the tidal salt marsh. The findings highlight an interactive mechanism of soil property and tidal underlying the response of SOM decomposition to temperature change in estuarine wetlands.

AB  - Salt marshes, which provide a transition between the marine and terrestrial environments around much of the temperate world, will be the first ecosystem to feel the effects of an increased rate of sea level rise. This study examined the metabolic responses of a high salt marsh to increased inundation and wrack deposition associated with sea level rise. We measured changes in ecosystem and soil photosynthesis and respiration by analyzing carbon dioxide fluxes in the light and dark. Data from seasonal flux measurements were combined with continuously measured light and temperature data to develop a model that estimated annual production and respiration. Results suggested that increased inundation will reduce respiration rates to a greater extent than production, yielding a moderate net loss of organic carbon from the high marsh. The model also predicted a substantial loss of organic carbon from wrack-affected areas. This decreased organic carbon input may play an important role in the ability of the marsh to maintain elevation relative to sea level rise.

AB  - Salt marshes buffer coastlines and provide critical ecosystem services from storm protection to food provision. Worldwide, these ecosystems are in danger of disappearing if they cannot increase elevation at rates that match sea-level rise. However, the magnitude of loss to be expected is not known. A synthesis of existing records of salt marsh elevation change was conducted in order to consider the likelihood of their future persistence. This analysis indicates that many salt marshes did not keep pace with sea-level rise in the past century and kept pace even less well over the past two decades. Salt marshes experiencing higher local sea-level rise rates were less likely to be keeping pace. These results suggest that sea level rise will overwhelm most salt marshes' capacity to maintain elevation. Under the most optimistic IPCC emissions pathway, 60% of the salt marshes studied will be gaining elevation at a rate insufficient to keep pace with sea-level rise by 2100. Without mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions this potential loss could exceed 90%, which will have substantial ecological, economic, and human health consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Salt marshes are critically important for a range of ecosystem services including nutrient filtration and carbon sequestration. Despite this, salt marshes are subjected to a variety of anthropogenic impacts, many with negative consequences. One impact is the introduction and subsequent proliferation of invasive species. An exotic strain of Phragmites australis has invaded salt marshes on the U.S. East Coast, affecting biodiversity, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. We quantified the difference between P. australis and native S. alterniflora in greenhouse gas emissions, net primary productivity, and biogeochemical parameters in sediment and porewater. Although we observed differences between the species (P. australis had greater biomass, drier and cooler sediments, and lower porewater nutrient concentrations), we obserVed no differences in greenhouse gas emissions. Vegetated and unvegetated plots had similar fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but very different fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to photosynthesis. Fluxes of the three gases examined were related to sediment temperature and live biomass. In addition, CH4 fluxes were linked to salinity while N2O fluxes were linked to photosynthetically active radiation. CO2 fluxes varied as expected over the seasons. Rates of CH4 production were generally low and typical of salt marshes, but showed a wide variation demonstrating the high spatial heterogeneity of CH4 production. The marsh in this study was not a significant sink or source of N2O, although small fluxes of N2O were detected on occasion. This study confirms that salt marshes with relatively low nitrogen impacts are not important contributors of N2O to the atmosphere. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal coastal lagoon with one of the largest continuous salt marshes in Europe. The objective of this work was to assess C, N and P stocks of Spartina maritima (low marsh pioneer halophyte) and Juncus maritimus (representative of mid-high marsh halophytes) combined with the contribution of Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia perennis, and Bolbochenous maritimus to the lagoon approximate to 4400 ha marsh area. A multivariate analysis (PCO), taking into account environmental variables and the annual biomass and nutrient dynamics, showed that there are no clear seasonal or spatial differences within low or mid-high marshes, but clearly separates J. maritimus and S. maritima marshes. Calculations of C, N and P stocks in the biomass of the five most representative halophytes plus the respective rhizosediment (25 cm depth), and taking into account their relative coverage, represents 252053 Mg C, 38100 Mg N and 7563 Mg P. Over 90% of the stocks are found within mid-high marshes. This work shows the importance of this lagoon's salt marshes on climate and nutrients regulation, and defines the current condition concerning the 'blue carbon' and nutrient stocks, as a basis for prospective future scenarios of salt marsh degradation or loss, namely under SLR context.

AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems in the global coastal ocean. Mangroves store more carbon (739 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)) than salt marshes (334 Mg C-ORG ha(-1)), but the latter sequester proportionally more (24%) net primary production (NPP) than mangroves (12%). Mangroves exhibit greater rates of gross primary production (GPP), aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and plant respiration (R-C), with higher P-GPP/R-C ratios, but salt marshes exhibit greater rates of below-ground NPP (BGNPP). Mangroves have greater rates of subsurface DIC production and, unlike salt marshes, exhibit active microbial decomposition to a soil depth of 1 m. Salt marshes release more CH4 from soil and creek waters and export more dissolved CH4, but mangroves release more CO2 from tidal waters and export greater amounts of particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), to adjacent waters. Both ecosystems contribute only a small proportion of GPP, R-E (ecosystem respiration) and NEP (net ecosystem production) to the global coastal ocean due to their small global area, but contribute 72% of air-sea CO2 exchange of the world's wetlands and estuaries and contribute 34% of DIC export and 17% of DOC + POC export to the world's coastal ocean. Thus, both wetland ecosystems contribute disproportionately to carbon flow of the global coastal ocean.

AB  - Fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere at 52 sites within a salt marsh were measured by a dark static chamber technique from mid July to mid September. Mean CH4 fluxes ranged from 0.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) to 11.0 mg m(-2) d(-1), with an overall average of 1.6 mg m(-2) d(-1). Flux of CH4 was inversely correlated (r(2) = 0.23, p = 0.001) with salinity of the upper porewater at the site, suggesting the dominant role of SO42- in inhibiting methanogenesis in salt-marsh sediments. The combination of salinity and water table position was able to explain only 29% of the variance in CH4 emission. Mean soil flux of CO2 ranged from 0.3 g m(-2) d(-1) to 3.7 g m(-2) d(-1), with an overall average of 2.5 g m(-2) d(-1); it was correlated with aboveground biomass (positive, r(2) = 0.38, p = 0.001) and position of the water table (negative, r(2) = 0.55, p = 0.001). The combination of biomass and water table position accounted for 63% of the variance in CO2 flux. There were high variations in gas flux within the six plant communities. The sequences were CH4: upland edge > panne > pool > middle marsh > low marsh > high marsh, and CO2: middle marsh > low marsh > upland edge > high marsh > panne > pool. Compared to other salt-marsh systems, this Bay of Fundy marsh emits small amounts of CH4 and CO2.

AB  - The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences climate and hydrology on the planet and may drive the structure and functioning of estuarine communities. However, the effects of the ENSO on coastal areas are dependent on the spatial scale and the intrinsic characteristics of the estuary. Over six years (2013 to 2018), we investigated the variability in macrobenthic secondary production of Spartina alterniflora marshes and adjacent unvegetated areas in a subtropical coastal lagoon in Southern Brazil. We tested whether the ENSO events affect the benthic secondary production of these two habitats. Most environmental variables (air temperature, northward surface stress and northward wind component) did not differ significantly between ENSO phases, except for precipitation. Monthly precipitation totals during El Nino months were 70% higher than neutral and La Nina conditions. A total of 25,862 organisms (8,191 in salt marshes and 17,671 in unvegetated areas) belonging to 39 taxa (25 in marshes and 34 unvegetated areas) were collected throughout the study. The tanaid Monokalliapseudes schubarti, and Nereididae polychaeta Laeonereis acuta were largely the most abundant species in both vegetated and unvegetated areas, with higher biomass and productivity. The secondary production in unvegetated areas increased 216%, from a mean of 107.5 g C/m(2)/y to 336.4 g C/m(2)/y during El Nino. However, the salt marshes responded differently than the unvegetated areas, with secondary production more stable over the time, with highest value of 164.2 g C/m(2)/y-(1). There is also a distinction in the effects on different species, L. acuta showed an increase only in biomass (from 0.024 to 0.042 g DW/0.03m(2)), whereas M. schubarti increased both in biomass (more than 4000%) and density (more than 5000%). In contrast, no significant differences in density, biomass and secondary production for both species were detected over time in the salt marshes. Our findings indicate that large scale climatic variations, such as ENSO, can strongly affect estuarine density, biomass and secondary production, but salt marshes buffer El Nino effects on benthic associations.

In this study, a chronosequence was constructed for four reclamation zones in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, eastern China (reclaimed in 1951, 1974, 1982, and 2007) and a reference salt marsh to identify both the process of soil organic carbon (SOC) evolution, as well as the effect of cropping and soil properties on SOC with time after reclamation. The results show that whereas soil nutrient elements and SOC increased after reclamation, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), pH, and bulk density decreased within 62 years following reclamation and agricultural amendment. In general, the soil's chemical properties remarkably improved and SOC increased significantly for approximately 30 years after reclamation. Reclamation for agriculture (rice and cotton) significantly increased the soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in the top 60 cm, especially in the top 0-30 cm. However, whereas the highest concentration of SOCD in rice-growing areas was in the top 0-20 cm of the soil profile, it was greater at a 20-60 cm depth in cottongrowing areas. Reclamation also significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC) levels in the 0-30 cm layer, thereby enhancing the stability of the soil carbon pool. SOC can thus increase significantly over a long time period after coastal reclamation, especially in areas of cultivation, where coastal SOC pools in eastern China tend to be more stable.

AB  - The biological sources and distribution of the aliphatic amines, monomethylamine (MMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA), were studied in the anoxic marine sediments of Flax Pond salt marsh, Long Island, New York. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Spartina alterniflora releases amines, especially TMA, to salt marsh sediment during decomposition. Benthic animals and phytoplankton also contained high amine concentrations and could be sources of amines to salt marsh sediments either by direct release or during decomposition.
   MMA, DMA and TMA were present in FP sediment porewaters and solid phases throughout the year. Concentrations generally ranged from 10 nM to 1 mu M in porewaters and 1-100 nmol/g dry wt in the solid phase. DMA dominated the porewater profiles, TMA the exchangeable pool, and MMA the fixed pool of amines. Concentrations varied seasonally with highest concentrations found in the fall when S. alterniflora began to senesce. The C/N ratio of organic matter undergoing decomposition in the sediment was calculated to be 11-12 from the annual sulfate reduction and ammonium and Sigma CO2 production rates. This C/N ratio is higher than the Redfield ratio, again suggesting that S. alterniflora is a major organic matter source to the sediment.

AB  - Food web theory predicts that current global declines in marine predators could generate unwanted consequences for many marine ecosystems. In coastal plant communities (kelp, seagrass, mangroves, and salt marsh), several studies have documented the far-reaching effects of changing predator populations. Across coastal ecosystems, the loss of marine predators appears to negatively affect coastal plant communities and the ecosystem services they provide. Here, we discuss some of the documented and suspected effects of predators on coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and the stability and resilience of coastal plant communities. In addition, we present a meta-analysis to assess the strength and direction of trophic cascades in kelp forests, seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves. We demonstrate that the strength and direction of trophic cascades varied across ecosystem types, with predators having a large positive effect on plants in salt marshes, a moderate positive effect on plants in kelp and mangroves, and no effect on plants in seagrasses. Our analysis also identified that there is a paucity of literature on trophic cascades for all four coastal plant systems, but especially seagrass and mangroves. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of predators in maintaining coastal ecosystem services, but also highlights the need for further research before large-scale generalizations about the prevalence, direction, and strength of trophic cascade in coastal plant communities can be made.

AB  - Mangrove forests are among the world's most productive and carbon-rich ecosystems. Despite growing understanding of factors controlling mangrove forest soil carbon stocks, there is a need to advance understanding of the speed of peat development beneath maturing mangrove forests, especially in created and restored mangrove forests that are intended to compensate for ecosystem functions lost during mangrove forest conversion to other land uses. To better quantify the rate of soil organic matter development beneath created, maturing mangrove forests, we measured ecosystem changes across a 25-yr chronosequence. We compared ecosystem properties in created, maturing mangrove forests to adjacent natural mangrove forests. We also quantified site-specific changes that occurred between 2010 and 2016. Soil organic matter accumulated rapidly beneath maturing mangrove forests as sandy soils transitioned to organic-rich soils (peat). Within 25 yr, a 20-cm deep peat layer developed. The time required for created mangrove forests to reach equivalency with natural mangrove forests was estimated as (1) <15 yr for herbaceous and juvenile vegetation, (2) ~55 yr for adult trees, (3) ~25 yr for the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), and (4) ~45-80 yr for the lower soil layer (10-30 cm). For soil elevation change, the created mangrove forests were equivalent to or surpassed natural mangrove forests within the first 5 yr. A comparison to chronosequence studies from other ecosystems indicates that the rate of soil organic matter accumulation beneath maturing mangrove forests may be among the fastest globally. In most peatland ecosystems, soil organic matter formation occurs slowly (over centuries, millennia); however, these results show that mangrove peat formation can occur within decades. Peat development, primarily due to subsurface root accumulation, enables mangrove forests to sequester carbon, adjust their elevation relative to sea level, and adapt to changing conditions at the dynamic land-ocean interface. In the face of climate change and rising sea levels, coastal managers are increasingly concerned with the longevity and functionality of coastal restoration efforts. Our results advance understanding of the pace of ecosystem development in created, maturing mangrove forests, which can improve predictions of mangrove forest responses to global change and ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Sea level rise, one of the most evident effects of recent climate change, is already impacting coastal ecosystems. Because of its low relief, population increase and economic development during the last century, the Celestun lagoon is highly vulnerable to global change, including sea level rise. Here, we study a sediment core from a tropical saltmarsh to evaluate the impact of sea level rise on sediment accretion and carbon fluxes. Some geochemical indicators in a Pb-210 dated sediment core showed clear signals of marine influence. This was reflected on increased accretion rates, from 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm yr(-1) in 1941 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 mm yr(-1) in 2012. These accretion rates were similar to eustatic sea level rise, and mean acceleration ranged from 0.037-0.22 mm yr(-2) implying a SLR by 2100 ranging from 14 to 86 cm. The one-century (1917-2013) organic carbon stock in sediments was calculated to be 10.1 +/- 0.2 Mg C ha(-1). During the same period, the organic carbon flux, corrected for organic carbon degradation, increased from 7 +/- 3 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to 73 +/- 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1), attributed to the impact of sea level rise in this ecosystem. This work shows that tropical saltmarshes may provide useful information on sea level rise, and the presented methodology may be used where instrumental records do not exist or they are too short.

AB  - Population densities of anaerobic Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) and aerobic heterotrophs were inversely correlated in the surficial (0-2 cm) layers of Sapelo Island, Georgia, salt marsh sediments. In surficial sediments where densities of aerobic heterotrophs were low, the density of culturable FeRB correlated positively with the concentration of amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxides extractable by ascorbate. High FeRB densities and a decrease with depth of ascorbate-extractable Fe(III) were observed in the upper 6 cm of a tidal creek core. Culturable sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and SRB-targeted rRNA signals were also detected in the upper 6-cm depth. The disappearance of FeRB below 6 cm, however, coincided with a large increase in the abundance of SRB. Thus, when FeRB are not limited by the availability of readily reducible amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, FeRB may outcompete SRB for growth substrates. Shewanella putrefaciens- and Geobacteraceae-targeted rRNA signals were at or below detection limits in all sediment samples, indicating that these FeRB are not predominant members of the active FeRB populations. The ubiquitous presence of FeRB at the sites studied challenges the traditional view that dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction is not an important pathway of organic carbon oxidation in salt marsh sediments.

AB  - During tidal inundation, exchange of particulate organic matter POM between salt marshes and tidal water may occur. This may result in changes in the seston-POM characteristics of the water. We investigated wheter such changes were found after inundation of Saeftinge, a salt marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (SW Netherlands). Seston was collected from a tidal creek of the marsh during 22 flood-ebb tide cycles. The characteristics of the flood and ebb seston samples were assessed by microbial bioassays, pyrolysis-mass spectrometry, and the determination of chlorophyll (a+b). There was a very strong agreement between the seasonal pattern in biodegradability and the seasonal pattern in chemical signature of the seston-POM. During autumn and winter, the degradability of seston-POM in the Westerschelde was relatively low. Neither the degradability nor the chemical characteristics of the POM showed much variation in this period. The enrichment of the POM-pool with phytoplankton appeared to be the major factor increasing the biodegradability and causing the changes in chemical characteristics of seston-POM in the Westerschelde in spring and summer. Only during a 2 mo period in summer did salt marsh inundation result in consistent differences in POM characteristics between flood and ebb: compared to the POM in the flood water, the POM leaving the marsh during the ebb was more refractory. In other periods, salt marsh inundation hardly affected biodegradability and chemical composition of seston-POM. This is considered an indication that the large estuarine salt marsh of Saeftinge is an irrelevant factor in determining the nature of POM in the estuary. The lack of differences between flood and ebb tide seston-POM also suggests that export of vascular plant detritus from this marsh, at least during moderate weather conditions, is insignificant.

AB  - Cryptic sulfur cycling is an enigmatic process in which sulfate is reduced to some lower-valence state sulfur species and subsequently quantitatively reoxidized; the rate and microbial energetics of this process and how prevalent it may be in the environment remain controversial. Here we investigate sulfur cycling in salt marsh sediments from Norfolk, England where we observe high ferrous iron concentrations with no depletion of sulfate or change in the sulfur isotope ratio of that sulfate, but a 5%(0) increase in the oxygen isotope ratio in sulfate, indicating that sulfate has been through a reductive cycle replacing its oxygen atoms. This cryptic sulfur cycle was replicated in laboratory incubations using O-18-enriched water, demonstrating that the field results do not solely result from mixing processes in the natural environment. Numerical modeling of the laboratory incubations scaled to represent the salt marsh sediments suggests that the uptake rate of sulfate during this cryptic sulfur cycling is similar to the uptake rate of sulfate during the fastest microbial sulfate reduction that has been measured in the natural environment. The difference is that during cryptic sulfur cycling, all of the sulfur is subsequently reoxidized to sulfate. We discuss mechanisms for this pathway of sulfur cycling including the possible link to the subsurface iron cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few comparisons exist between vertical accretion (VA) and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in restored versus historic (i.e. reference) marshes. Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1). This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.

AB  - The Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island, SC, is surrounded by tidal salt marshes, which are breeding habitats for many pestiferous biting flies. Knowledge of biting fly behavior patterns is needed to develop effective pest management strategies in urban areas adjacent to salt marshes. We measured biting midge (Ceratopogonidae) and mosquito (Culicidae) seasonal abundance and diel activity patterns on Parris Island using CO2-baited suction traps from November 2001 - November 2004. Of the three biting midge species collected, Culicoides furens was most abundant (86.2% of total) and was present in high numbers from late March to November. Culicoides hollensis (12.0% of total) was present during spring and fall but absent in summer and winter; and Culicoides melleus (1.7% of total) was present in spring through fall but absent in winter. Abundance of C. furens had a positive linear correlation with air temperature and rainfall. There were nonlinear correlations between air temperature and C. hollensis and C. melleus numbers, which were most abundant at moderate temperatures. Of 18 mosquito species collected, the most abundant were Aedes taeniorhynchus (42.7% of total), Aedes sollicitans (26.3% of total), Culex salinarius (15.6% of total), Culex quinquefasciatus (7.3% of total), and Aedes vexans (5.7% of total); other species comprised <5% of collections. Aedes taeniorhynchus numbers were positively correlated with temperature and rainfall, and Cx. salinarius was correlated with soil moisture. Activity of most biting midges and mosquitoes were highest the first two hours following sunset. Species of biting flies were present in all months, suggesting that year-round control measures are necessary to reduce exposure to potential disease vectors and nuisance biting.

AB  - Tropical salt marshes in Louisiana are at risks of accidental oil spills and remediation of these ecosystems is mainly limited to natural biodegradation due to physical sensitivity of the ecosystems. This study investigated both intrinsic and nutrient enhanced rates of crude oil degradation in core studies. In addition, loading rates of nitrogen and optimal porewater nitrogen concentrations were determined. Nitrogen additions increased biodegradation rates of some alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Addition of NH4+-N increased zero-order mineralization constants of labeled hexadecane and phenanthrene up to 15.4-19.2% (Fourchon marsh) and 56.2% (Ugly Shack Bayou marsh) and rates of total carbon dioxide production up to 14.0-33.1% (Fourchon marsh) and 3.0% (Ugly Shack Bayou marsh), respectively. Efficient biodegradation of crude oil was achieved when NH4+ was applied at the loading rate of 28.3-56.6 g N m(-2) producing porewater concentration at the level of 80-450 mg NH4+-N L-1. No significant lag time was observed indicating that nitrogen application directly stimulates biodegradation of crude oil in tropical salt marshes in Louisiana.

AB  - Two New England salt marshes exposed to different N availability were assessed seasonally for 1 yr, creating the first complete salt marsh Si budgets. Triplicate seasonal measurements were collected for aboveground biomass of dominant Spartina species (S. alterniflora Loisel. and S. patens (Aiton) Muhl.), belowground vegetation (roots and rhizomes), sediment, and pore water. Measured Si values (reported as SiO2) diverged in several respects to that of other wetlands. Biogenic Si (BSi) concentrations in S. alterniflora were > 1% of dry weight (dry wt), values higher than previously reported in a temperate salt marsh. Rhizomes had significantly less BSi than roots (0.45% and 1.24% dry wt in the rhizomes and roots, respectively). Roots at the high-N marsh had higher BSi concentrations (average 1.44 +/- 0.11% dry wt) than reported in other wetland plant species. Likewise, sediment amorphous Si (ASi) concentrations (> 12% ASi) were elevated compared with most other temperate wetlands, although the average (4.4% +/- 0.5% ASi dry wt) was within the range of other reported values. A clear pattern toward more Si accumulation at the N-enriched salt marsh was found in the roots, sediment, and pore water, and occasionally in the aboveground vegetation. Unlike other aquatic systems, N enrichment does not result in salt marsh Si limitation, despite the presence of Si-accumulating organisms (marsh grasses). Increased soil respiration, sediment availability, and rates of organic matter decomposition are hypothesized to cause higher Si accumulation at the high-N marsh. This relationship was most pronounced in the summer for S. patens, leading us also to hypothesize that Si accumulation in marsh grasses may be related to temperature stress.

AB  - Loss of tidal wetlands is a world-wide phenomenon. Many factors may contribute to such loss, but among them are geochemical stressors such as exposure of the marsh plants to elevated levels on hydrogen sulfide in the pore water of the marsh peat. Here we report the results of a study of the geochemistry of iron and sulfide at different seasons in unrestored (JoCo) and partially restored (Big Egg) salt marshes in Jamaica Bay, a highly urbanized estuary in New York City where the loss of salt marsh area has accelerated in recent years. The spatial and temporal 2-dimensional distribution patterns of dissolved Fe2+ and H2S in salt marshes were in situ mapped with high resolution planar sensors for the first time. The vertical profiles of Fe2+ and hydrogen sulfide, as well as related solutes and redox potentials in marsh were also evaluated by sampling the pore water at discrete depths. Sediment cores were collected at various seasons and the solid phase Fe, S, N, C, and chromium reducible sulfide in marsh peat at discrete depths were further investigated in order to study Fe and S cycles, and their relationship to the organic matter cycling at different seasons. Our results revealed that the redox sensitive elements Fe2+ and S2- showed significantly heterogeneous and complex three dimensional distribution patterns in salt marsh, over mm to cm scales, directly associated with the plant roots due to the oxygen leakage from roots and redox diagenetic reactions. We hypothesize that the oxic layers with low/undetected H2S and Fe2+ formed around roots help marsh plants to survive in the high levels of H2S by reducing sulfide absorption. The overall concentrations of Fe2+ and H2S and distribution patterns also seasonally varied with temperature change. H2S level in JoCo sampling site could change from 5 mM in fall season, reflecting significantly seasonal variation in the rates of bacterial oxidation of organic matter at this marsh site. Solid phase Fe and S showed that very high fractions of the diagenetically reactive iron at JoCo and Big Egg were associated with pyrite that can persist for long periods in anoxic sediments. This implies that there is insufficient diagenetically reactive iron to buffer the pore water hydrogen sulfide through formation of iron sulfides at JoCo and Big Egg.

AB  - PAHs contamination in sediments is a subject of current concern since they constitute a secondary source of these pollutants for the water column. Remediation of contaminated sediments is a complex and costly process but salt marsh plants might be useful for hydrocarbons phytoremediation. With this aim, the levels of PAHs were evaluated in sediments of 5 estuaries/lagoons along the Atlantic (Lima, Cavado, Douro and Sado estuaries) and Mediterranean (Ria Formosa) Portuguese coasts, aiming to research the role of different salt marsh plants on PAHs retention/remediation, and whether they contribute for PAHs sequestration or mineralization. In each estuary, a non-colonized sediment and one or more colonized sediments (rhizosediments) were collected representing colonies of 7 salt marsh plants (Juncus maritimus, Phragmites australis, Triglochin striata, Halimione portulacoides, Scirpus maritimus, Spartina maritimaand Sarcocornia fruticosa). In general, PAHs levels were low (around 100 mu g kg(-1)), equivalent to background levels found in areas without significant anthropogenic activities. Nevertheless, one site in Sado estuary and one in Douro estuary revealed punctual sources mainly of 4- and 5-ring PAHs.
   Colonized sediments revealed higher capacity to sequester PAHs via the accumulation of higher contents of organic matter and thinner particulate fractions. J. maritimus, a widespread salt marsh plant, promoted the fixation of PAHs in rhizosediments, to a similar extent as the remaining plants. The exception was H. portulacoides which might have less accumulation potential of PAHs or their degradation in the vicinity of the roots is higher. This study demonstrated that salt marsh plants are a valuable element for the containment of PAH-contaminated sediments, which can then suffer biotic transformations or be available for remediation procedures.

AB  - Aims Salt marsh vegetation is an important contributor of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to coastal waters. The dynamics of DOM leaching from different marsh plants, however, have not been well studied or compared.
   Methods In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the processes of DOM leaching from three common marsh plants (Phragrnites australis, Suaeda salsa and Aeluropus littoralis) collected from the Yellow River Delta (YRD) salt marsh in October 2016. The YRD is one of the largest and most well-protected coastal ecosystems on the east coast of China.
   Important Findings We found that the plant leaves released DOM at much higher concentrations than the plant roots or stems, as measured by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN). On average, 15% of the biomass C and 30% of the biomass N were released from the plant leaves as DOC and DN during the 27-day incubation period. The DOM released from the plants was very labile, and 92A%-98.1% of the DOC arid 88.0%-94.6% of the DN released from the plants were consumed by bacteria during the 27-day incubation period. The fluorescence characteristics of the plant-released DOM indicated that chromophoric dissolved organic matter was a major fraction of the DOM and that protein-like components were the primary organic fractions released from the plants. Bacterial degradation altered both the fluorescence properties and the chemical composition of the DOM. The results of the laboratory experiments were well supported by the field investigation, which indicated that a large amount of DOM was outwelled from the YRD salt marshes in late autumn. Our study suggests that the DOM released from the biomass of salt marsh plants provides an important source of both DOC and DN for marsh and coastal waters. The highly labile DOC and DN provide essential food sources to support microbial communities in the YRD salt marsh and adjacent coastal waters.

AB  - Large amounts of tidally accumulated detritus (i.e., wrack) are an important source of disturbance affecting different abiotic and biotic characteristics in salt marshes, which could in turn affect the macrofauna assemblage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.

AB  - Smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, dominates salt marshes on the east coast of the United States. While the physicochemical cues affecting S. alterniflora productivity have been studied intensively, the role of plant-microbe interactions in ecosystem functioning remains poorly understood. Thus, in this study, the effects of S. alterniflora phenotype on the composition of archaeal, bacterial, diazotrophic and fungal communities were investigated. Overall, prokaryotic communities were more diverse and bacteria were more abundant in the areas colonized by the tall plant phenotype in comparison to those of short plant phenotype. Diazotrophic methanogens (Methanomicrobia) preferentially colonized the area of the short plant phenotype. Putative iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria and sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacteria were identified as indicator species in the rhizosphere of tall and short plant phenotypes, respectively. Finally, while diazotrophic populations shaped microbial interactions in the areas colonized by the tall plant phenotype, fungal populations filled this role in the areas occupied by the short plant phenotype. The results here demonstrate that S. alterniflora phenotype and proximity to the root zone are selective forces dictating microbial community assembly. Results further reveal that reduction-oxidation chemistry is a major factor driving the selection of belowground microbial populations in salt marsh habitats.

AB  - A Functional and Structural Trajectory (FAST) model is presented that predicts the evolution of wetland structure and function during salt marsh ecosystem development. The FAST model is tested by comparing structural and functional attributes of marsh producers (Spartina), consumers (benthic invertebrates) and nutrient cycles (C, N, P) along a chronosequence of 1 to 28 year-old constructed Spartina alterniflora a marshes with paired older reference (natural) marshes. Salt marsh structure and function followed two inherently different trajectories during ecosystem development. Functional attributes, like Spartina biomass, invertebrate density and carbon and nutrient accumulation, exceeded 100% equivalence before decreasing to levels found in reference marshes. In contrast, structural attributes like Spartina stem density and height, invertebrate species richness and soil carbon and nutrient pools gradually converged to equivalence without ever exceeding levels in reference marshes. Our trajectories also revealed that different components of the restored salt marsh ecosystem developed at different rates. Both Spartina structure and function achieved equivalence to reference wetlands within 10-15 years following establishment. Development of invertebrate structure and function required 15-20 years. Soil C and nutrient accumulation occurred almost instantaneously with colonization by Spartina. However, after 28 years, soil C and N pools were considerably less than in reference marshes. Our FAST model demonstrates that trajectories can be developed and used to predict the evolution of salt marsh structure and function during wetland ecosystem development. The model should be tested using similar ecosystems in different geographic regions and in other detritus based ecosystems to evaluate its predictive power and robustness.

AB  - Lignin-derived phenols, C/N ratios and ratios of refractory to total organic matter were used to study the sources, distribution, and diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter along estuary, river bank, and salt marsh systems. The Changjiang Estuary showed a higher signal of terrestrial organic matter at the river mouth which decreased farther offshore. The locations along the Qiantang River were affected by their adjacent surroundings, and the Andong salt marsh showed higher terrestrial organic matter signal at the upper marsh compared to the lower marsh. All studied areas showed slight increases in organic matter decomposition farther downstream and towards the sea. Study of these three different systems will improve our understanding on their ecotoxicological impact. The Changjiang Estuary had higher pollutant levels near the river mouth, which decreased farther offshore due to dilution. The midstream Qiantang River was most likely affected by pollution from their adjacent surroundings. Pollutants were likely to be accumulated in the Andong salt marsh due to the presence of marsh plants and small-sized particles. Organic pollutants were likely to be decomposed during transport along the systems. The ability of the sediments to release inorganic pollutants was determined by whether these systems were oxic or anoxic.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are major global carbon sinks; however, they are heterogeneous and dynamic ecosystems. To characterize spatial and temporal variability in a New England salt marsh, greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes were compared among major plant-defined zones during growing seasons. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes were compared in two mensurative experiments during summer months (2012-2014) that included low marsh (Spartina alterniflora), high marsh (Distichlis spicata and Juncus gerardii-dominated), invasive Phragmites australis zones, and unvegetated ponds. Day-and nighttime fluxes were also contrasted in the native marsh zones. N2O fluxes were measured in parallel with CO2 and CH4 fluxes, but were not found to be significant. To test the relationships of CO2 and CH4 fluxes with several native plant metrics, a multivariate nonlinear model was used. Invasive P. australis zones (-7 to -15 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) and S. alterniflora low marsh zones (up to -14 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) displayed highest average CO2 -uptake rates, while those in the native high marsh zone (less than -2 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) were much lower. Unvegetated ponds were typically small sources of CO2 to the atmosphere (< 0.5 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1)). Night-time emissions of CO2 averaged only 35% of daytime uptake in the low marsh zone, but they exceeded daytime CO2 uptake by up to threefold in the native high marsh zone. Based on modeling, belowground biomass was the plant metric most strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes in native marsh zones, while none of the plant variables correlated significantly with CH4 fluxes. Methane fluxes did not vary between day and night and did not significantly offset CO2 uptake in any vegetated marsh zones based on sustained global warming potential calculations. These findings suggest that attention to spatial zonation as well as expanded measurements and modeling of GHG emissions across greater temporal scales will help to improve accuracy of carbon accounting in coastal marshes.

AB  - Seawalls have increasingly been constructed to control the invasion of an exotic perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, in coastal wetlands of eastern China. We investigated soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), available and microbial C and N, soil microbial community composition and biomass in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh compared with an adjacent natural S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation in S. alterniflora salt marsh significantly decreased soil salinity, moisture, litter and root biomass, and strongly decreased soil total organic C by 57% and total organic N by 59%, and also lowered soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Seawall reclamation significantly decreased soil microbial biomass C and the quantities of the total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), and bacterial, fungal, gram-negative bacterial, gram-positive bacterial, saturated straight-chain, and monounsaturated PLFAs in deeper soil layers (10-30 cm). Our results suggested that seawall construction could greatly decrease soil C and N accumulation of S. alterniflora salt marsh by decreasing S. alterniflora residuals input into the soil and lowering soil salinity and moisture, which further decreased soil microbial biomass by lowering soil available C and N in S. alterniflora salt marsh. Changes in soil microbial community composition and biomass could in turn affect soil C and N accumulation in a seawall-reclaimed S. alterniflora salt marsh in eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The North Frisian Halligen (Northern Germany) are inhabited and highly anthropogenic modified coastal marshlands. Today a lack of knowledge about sedimentological parameters prevent for a predicated discussion on their adaptation capacity to recent and future sea-level changes. A combined field and laboratory method to calculate marshland accretion rates based on short-term (2010-2013) measurements of sediment depositions was developed. All studies were carried out at the marshlands of the Halligen Hooge, Langeness and Nordstrandischmoor. One litre LDPE bottles and small synthetic turf mats were used as simple but coast, time and quantity efficient sediment trap devices. Up to a deposition rate, of approximate to 2.0 kg/m(2), both devices gained comparable results. Above this threshold the retention efficiency of the turf mats is decreasing compared to the LDPD bottles. The combined use of bottles and mats, especially when deposition rates are not exceeding the threshold, allows to (1) checking internal consistency of the data, (2) detecting outliers with respect to cattle- or man-made damage, and (3) estimating possible effects of post-storm sediment remobilization. To transfer sediment depositions into rates of vertical accretion, the bulk dry density as well as the organic matter concentration of the correspondent marsh soil was considered using data from shallow percussion cores. These parameters are different among all Halligen. Higher inundation frequencies cause lower soil organic matter concentrations, resulting in higher bulk dry densities (BDD) of the soil (Hooge 0.64 g/cm(3), Langeness 0.67 g/cm(3), Nordstrandischmoor 0.83 g/cm(3)). Autochthonous organic material (by source of the marshland vegetation) contributes by 9.0 +/- 1.4 % (Hooge) to 21.4 +/- 6.6 % (Nordstrandischmoor) to marshland accretion, for a correspondent time scale of 1915-2011. Average accretion rates (2010-2013) were calculated with 1.2 +/- 0.8 mm/a for Langeness, 1.5 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Hooge and 2.6 +/- 0.9 mm/a for Nordstrandischmoor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Salt marshes are well-known sinks of carbon and nitrogen, incorporating them both into sediment and in the halophyte biomass, being key players in the estuarine biogeochemical cycles. Due to aboveground senescence there will inevitably occur losses of C and N rich detritus, becoming prone to the tidal flooding and hydrodynamic regime. On the other hand, the ongoing climate change effects, such as sea level rise (SLR) are known to have influence in the estuarine circulation. The Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal lagoon located in the Northwestern Portuguese coast, presenting a very complex geometry and characterized by large areas of salt marshes and tidal flats distributed along a web of narrow channels. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry, tidal dissipation and detritus Lagrangian trajectories were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario. The results here discussed show that in the case of Ria de Aveiro, the examined salt marsh exports about 15 kg Cm-2 y(-1) and 2 kg N m(-2) y(-1). Nowadays, Barra salt marsh presents the highest values of residual circulation, but predictions point out to its reduction due to SLR scenario. Barra salt marsh shows highly dynamic conditions by being exposed to higher current velocities, increased erosion rates and longer and more frequent inundation periods. This way, model results of Lagrangian particles indicate that the detrital particles are highly dispersed, with large amounts approaching the outer area of the lagoon, a feature that is highly enhanced in the SLR scenario. These features may have two major implications: (1) enhance the fuelling of secondary production in the coastal shelf and (2) excessive N exports and possible eutrophication of the coastal area. These two consequences (positive and negative) acquire even more importance if all the marsh extension along all the Ria de Aveiro is considered along with its elevated amount of plant-generated detritus. Regarding the present predictions and concerns on estuarine ecology in a global change framework, it becomes important to consider these estuarine salt marshes not only as possible nutrient sinks, but also as a potential N source enhanced by the ongoing climate changes.

AB  - Electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium ratio and water depth have negative impacts, whereas soil organic matter concentration has a positive impact on Black Sea salt marsh vegetation. The most saline soils were characterized by Salicornia prostrata vegetation and associated with exchangeable sodium ratio.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and have been identified as sources of uncertainty in the global carbon budget. Here we introduce a recently established mesonet of eddy covariance towers in South Carolina and describe the sensor arrays and data workflow used to produce three site-years of flux observations in coastal ecosystems. The tower sites represent tidal salt marsh (US-HB1), mature longleaf pine forest (US-HB2), and longleaf pine restoration (replanted clearcut; US-HB3). Coastal ecosystems remain less represented in climate studies despite their potential to sequester large amounts of carbon. Our goal in publishing this open access dataset is to contribute observations in understudied coastal ecosystems to facilitate synthesis and modeling analyses that advance carbon cycle science.

AB  - A synthesis of a comprehensive annual study of material processing in the Bly Creek marsh-estuarine basin is described. The project design provides statistical estimates of material fluxes for the water column, salt marsh, and oyster reef subsystems. Fluxes from a freshwater stream, groundwater, and rain are also presented. Material processing by the Bly Creek marsh-estuarine basin is constituent- and subsystem-specific. Inflows of material via rain, streamwater, and groundwater are small and relatively unimportant compared to tidal fluxes. The salt marsh dominates the basin in aerial extent and in terms of net material fluxes. Most constituents exhibit significant net annual import to the salt marsh. Only DON is exported from the marsh and from the basin at significant levels. The salt marsh appears to recycle most of the nitrogen and phosphorus needed for marsh grass primary production. Sufficient inorganic particulate material is imported to allow the salt marsh to maintain its elevation with respect to ongoing sea-level rise. As a result of metabolic processes, the oyster reef imports particulate materials and releases dissolved nutrients. The reef is a significant consumer of chl a and produces enough dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to support water column primary production. The N:P ratio of Bly Creek dissolved inorganic nutrients is lower than that of North Inlet or ocean waters and implies nitrogen conservation or mobilization of particulate phosphorus into orthophosphate. In contrast to human-impacted coastal systems, this pristine basin reduces the N:P ratio as water passes through it. Differences in the N:P ratio are probably the result of DON export, denitrification, and phosphorus import by the basin.

AB  - A novel bio-entrapped salt marsh sediment membrane reactor (BESMSMR) was evaluated for treating high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater, and membrane fouling behaviour was also assessed. The BESMSMR was operated in parallel with a conventional membrane bioreactor (CMBR), and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) as well as an entrapped biomass MBR (bio-entrapped membrane reactor, BEMR) to facilitate a meaningful comparison of performance characteristics obtained in these reactor systems. Two hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 60 and 40,h with organic loading rates (OLRs) varied from 7.0 to 11.9 kg COD/m(3) d were tested. The pharmaceutical wastewater used has an average total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of 17,931 1851 mg/L and total dissolved solids (TDS) of 20,881 2030 mg/L. The BESMSMR demonstrated the highest removal efficiencies of TCOD (78.481.3%), due to the ability of the marine sediment microorganisms seeded from coastal shores to thrive in the hyper-saline environment and degraded recalcitrant organic matter present in the pharmaceutical wastewater. The anoxic zone presented in the inner part of bio-carriers could have triggered the denitrification reaction, and thus improved the TN removal rate by 15-20%. Membrane fouling was reduced with lower concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), and soluble microbial products (SMP) in the entrapped biomass MBRs. Proteins rather than carbohydrates were the main component of EPS and SMP in the MBR systems. The novel BESMSMR possesses the benefits of salt marsh sediment and an entrapped biomass technique that offered effective organic removal for the high -salinity pharmaceutical wastewater and reduced membrane fouling.

AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes provide favorable conditions for nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Saltwater intrusion caused by sea-level rise would exert complex effects on the production and emission of N2O in estuarine tidal marshes; however, few studies have been conducted on its effects on N2O emissions. Salinity gradients are a common occurrence in estuarine tidal marshes. Studies on production and emission of N2O in tidal marshes with different salinities may elucidate the impact of saltwater intrusion on the emission of greenhouse gases. This study explores the seasonal variations of N2O fluxes and soil denitrification rates in freshwater (Daoqingzhou wetland) and brackish (Shanyutan wetland) tidal marshes dominated by Cyperus malaccensis var. brevifolius (shichito matgrass) in the Min River estuary, southeastern China. N2O fluxes in both marshes showed strong temporal variability. The highest N2O fluxes were observed in the hot and wet summer months, whereas the lowest fluxes were observed in the cold winter and autumn months. N2O fluxes from the freshwater marsh (48.81 +/- 9.01 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those from the brackish-water marsh (27.69 +/- 4.01 mu g m(-2) h(-1)). Soil denitrification rates showed a similar temporal pattern, with the highest rates observed in summer and the lowest in winter. Similarly, soil denitrification rates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the freshwater marsh (32.72 +/- 19.15 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) than in the brackish-water marsh (4.97 +/- 2.64 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). Temperature and the salinity, sulfate (SO42-), and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentrations of the overlying water were key factors affecting soil denitrification rates. N2O fluxes and soil denitrification rates demonstrated negative correlations with salinity and SO42- concentrations in both marshes. The results indicate that increased seawater intrusion would reduce N2O emissions from estuarine tidal wetlands and exert a negative feedback on the climate system. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tidal flooding is the basic hydrological feature of a salt marsh, and controls its ecosystem carbon exchange. However, the response of ecosystem carbon exchange to different stages of tidal flooding remains poorly documented. To further explore this issue, we conducted a field experiment to assess the effect of tidal stages (before flooding stage, rising tide stage, tidal flooding stage and after ebbing stage), water levels (a control, a low water level (LWL), a middle water level (MWL) and a high water level (HWL)) and soil salinity on ecosystem CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the rising tide stage significantly inhibited the uptake of CO2 (LWL: 1.49 +/- 0.23 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 1.10 +/- 0.35 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.54 +/- 0.08 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Meanwhile, the rising tide stage also promoted CH4 emissions of MWL and HWL treatments (MWL: 0.97 +/- 0.36 nmol m(-2) s(-1); HWL: 0.93 +/- 0.24 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). CH4 emissions of the after ebbing stage was higher than that of the before flooding stage, and this difference was significant of LWL and MWL treatments (LWL: 0.56 +/- 0.12 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1); MWL: 0.79 +/- 0.13 vs 0.40 +/- 0.09 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Moreover, ecosystem CO2 exchange of the HWL treatment was almost completely suppressed during tidal inundation period. During tidal inundation period, net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was significantly positively correlated with water levels, but CH4 emissions was not significantly affected by water levels. In addition, the rate of CO2 uptake decreased linearly with soil salinity during the non-inundation period. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the carbon exchange process coupling with the complete tidal flooding process in future researches.

AB  - Salt marshes are key coastal ecosystems that provide habitats for wildlife, including invertebrates, fishes, and birds. They provide ecosystem services such as protection from storm surges and waves, attenuation of flooding, sequestration of pollutants (e.g., blue carbon), and nutrient removal. They are currently under great threat from sea level rise (SLR). We collected information about trends in the horizontal extent (acreage) of New Jersey salt marshes and recent elevation changes compared with the current local rate of SLR in New Jersey, which is between 5 and 6 mm year(-1). We found pervasive, although variable, rates of marsh loss that resulted from both anthropogenic disturbance as well as edge erosion and interior ponding expected from SLR. Elevation trends suggest that the current rates of SLR exceed most marsh elevation gains, although some Phragmites-dominated marshes keep pace with SLR. Four potential remedies to address current coastal trends of marsh loss were described in the context of New Jersey's regulatory and management environment: protection of marsh inland migration pathways, altered management of Phragmites, thin layer sediment placement, and living shoreline installations. Proactive steps are necessary if coastal wetland ecosystems are to be maintained over the next few decades.

AB  - Dynamics of carbon (C) gas emission from wetlands influence global C cycling. In many freshwater systems such as Louisiana freshwater marsh, soil contents of NO3- and SO42- have increased due to nutrient loading and saltwater intrusion. This could affect C mineralization and the emission of the major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In this investigation, a laboratory microcosm study was carried out to elucidate the effects of NO3- and SO42- on CO2 and CH4 production from a freshwater marsh soil located in the Barataria Basin of Louisiana coast, which has been subjected to the Mississippi River diversion and seawater intrusion. Composite soil samples were collected from top 50 cm marsh profile, treated with different levels of NO3- (0, 3.2 and 5 mM) or SO42- (0, 2, and 5 mM) concentrations, and incubated for 214 d under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that the presence of NO3 (especially at 3.2 mM) significantly decreased CO2 productions whereas SO42- did not. On the other hand, both NO3- and SO2- treatments decreased CH4 production but the NO3- almost completely inhibited CH4 pro duction (>99%) whereas the SO42- treatments reduced CH4 production by 78-90%. The overall C mineralization rate constant under the NO3 presence was also low. In addition, the results revealed that a large proportion (95Z) of anaerobic carbon mineralization in the untreated freshwater soil was unexplained by the reduction of any of the measured major electron acceptors.

AB  - It has been shown that salt marshes may function as efficient sinks for contaminants, namely for mercury. At the rhizo-sediment Hg may be associated with Mn and Fe oxyhydroxides, precipitated as sulphides or incorporated into organic matter. However, to our knowledge, in situ studies have not focused on the related processes at a daily or tidal cycle scales. Thus, the present work aims to study the effect of a common salt marsh halophyte in temperate latitudes (Sarcocornia perennis) on dissolved Fe, Mn and Hg concentrations in the water column. The in situ approach was carried out at a mercury-contaminated salt marsh and at the adjacent non-vegetated area (distance <= 4 m), covering two consecutive tidal cycles in order to include the photosynthetic active period and the night processes. During high tide no daily or spatial effects were observed on the concentrations of Mn, Fe and Hg in the water column, due to the dilution effect of the incoming seawater. During low tide the concentrations of Mn, Fe and Hg were significantly higher in the overlaying water column of the salt marsh. At S. perennis mats the concentration of dissolved total Hg was significantly related with the concentration of Mn (r = 0.459, p = 0.028, n = 23), but not with that of Fe (r = 0.367, p 0.085, n = 23) while no significant relations were found at the adjacent non-vegetated sediments.

AB  - Large oilfields are often coincidentally located in major river deltas and wetlands, and potentially damage the structure, function and ecosystem service values of wetlands during oil exploration. In the present study, the effects of crude oil contamination during oil exploration on soil physical and chemical properties were investigated in marshes of the Momoge National Nature Reserve in Jilin Province, China. The concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons in the marsh soil near the oil wells are significantly higher than those in the adjacent control marsh. Soil water contents in oil-contaminated marshes are negatively correlated with soil temperature and are significantly lower than those in the control area, especially in fall. Crude oil contamination significantly increases the soil pH up to 8.0, and reduces available phosphorus concentrations in the soil. The concentrations of total organic carbon are significantly different among sampling sites. Therefore, crude oil contamination could potentially alkalinize marsh soils, adversely affect soil fertility and physical properties, and cause deterioration of the marshes in the Momoge National Nature Reserve. Phyto-remediation by planting Calamagrostis angustifolia has the potential to simultaneously restore and remediate the petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated wetlands. Crude oil contamination affects the soil physical and chemical properties, so developing an effective restoration program in the Momoge wetland is neccesary.

AB  - Sediment cores of 60 cm length were collected from two Tagus estuary salt marshes. At each salt marsh, samples were taken from a non-vegetated zone and one from each of areas dominated by Halimione portulacoides, Spartina maritima and Arthrocnemum fruticosum. Cores were sliced in situ and, at each sediment layer, redox potential and pH were measured, and the organic matter content (LOI), grain size, and concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr were determined. Sediment between roots and non-vegetated sediments of the same depth (5-15 cm) were extracted with several acid solutions, and the metal concentrations were compared. Metal residues were determined in roots of vascular plants.
   Sediment between roots was more oxidative, more acidic and richer in organic matter than non-vegetated sediment. Profiles of Zn, Pb and Cu concentrations in vegetated sediments differed from those recorded in non-vegetated areas: at subsurface layers (where root density is higher), Zn, Pb and Cu were enriched. The percentages of Zn, Pb and Cu removed by acetic acid, nitric acid and DTPA extractions from sediment between roots were much lower than those from non-vegetated sediments, being preferentially linked to the residual fraction. Chromium and Ni behave differently no subsurface enrichment being found and their associations being similar in the two types of sediment. Furthermore, Ni concentrations in roots were much lower than in bulk sediments, while levels of Zn and Fb were similar and Cu values higher. These results point out that plants are an important feature for metal accumulation in salt marshes. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Due to the high volume of crude oil released by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the salt marshes along the gulf coast were contaminated with crude oil. Biodegradation of crude oil in salt marshes is primarily limited by oxygen availability due to the high organic carbon content of the soil, high flux rate of S2-, and saturated conditions. Chlorate, nitrate, and perchlorate were evaluated for use as electron acceptors in comparison to oxygen by comparing oil transformation and mineralization in mesocosms consisting of oiled salt marsh sediment from an area impacted by the BP Horizon oil spill. Mineralization rates were determined by measuring CO2 production and delta C-13 of the produced CO2 and compared to transformation evaluated by measuring the alkane/hopane ratios over a 4-month period. Total alkane/hopane ratios decreased (similar to 55-70 %) for all treatments in the following relative order: aerated approximate to chlorate > nitrate > perchlorate. Total CO2 produced was similar between treatments ranging from 550-700 mg CO2-C. The delta C-13-CO2 values generally ranged between the indigenous carbon and oil values (-17 and -27%, respectively). Oil mineralization was greatest for the aerated treatments and least for the perchlorate amended. Our results indicate that chlorate has a similar potential as oxygen to support oil mineralization in contaminated salt marshes, but nitrate and perchlorate were less effective. The use of chlorate as a means to promote oil mineralization in situ may be a promising means to remediate contaminated salt marshes while preventing unwanted secondary impacts related to nutrient management as in the case of nitrate amendments.

AB  - The Sanjiang Plain has become an intensive area of land use/cover change in China. However, little is known about the effect of cultivation on soil microbiological properties in this freshwater marsh ecosystem. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of cultivation on mineralizable, microbial biomass, and total C in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) was 4346 +/- 309 mg kg(-1) in undisturbed marsh and 229 mg kg(-1) in soil cultivated for 15 years. Undisturbed marsh soil had the highest microbial quotient (3.64%), which declined with increasing cultivation time (R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.01). Metabolic quotient increased with increasing cultivation time. Soil C mineralization in undisturbed marsh was 3.5 times that in soil cultivated for I year, and was 12 times that in soil cultivated for 15 years. Cultivation strongly affected measured soil microbiological properties. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and aims Due to the production of large amounts of tannins and phenolics by Rhizophora mangle, it was hypothesized that the invasion of this mangrove species in salt marshes due to global warming will result in changes in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen.
   Methods Leaf litter and/or seedlings of R. mangle were placed into 1-m(2) experimental plots in a Distichlis spicata-dominated salt marsh on the Atlantic Coast of central Florida (USA). An additional litter decomposition experiment was conducted in all plots by adding litter bags containing 10 g of dried D. spicata shoot litter. Seedling growth was measured yearly. One and four years after the start of the experiment, soil samples were collected to determine physical and chemical soil conditions, potential nitrification and denitrification activities and abundances of genes that are related to microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle.
   Results Growth of R. mangle seedlings was stimulated in the presence of R. mangle litter, while decomposition rates of D. spicata litter were lower in plots with R. mangle litter and seedlings. The presence of R. mangle litter and/or seedlings had no significant effect on potential nitrification and denitrification activities and on the abundances of genes.
   Conclusions The colonization of R. mangle into D. spicata-dominated salt marshes will affect the carbon cycle, but not necessarily the nitrogen cycle, which is likely due to the pre-existing nitrogen-limited conditions in the salt marsh.

AB  - Sea level rise will change inundation regimes in salt marshes, altering redox dynamics that control nitrification - a potential source of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) - and denitrification, a major nitrogen (N) loss pathway in coastal ecosystems and both a source and sink of N2O. Measurements of net N2O fluxes alone yield little insight into the different effects of redox conditions on N2O production and consumption. We used in situ measurements of gross N2O fluxes across a salt marsh elevation gradient to determine how soil N2O emissions in coastal ecosystems may respond to future sea level rise. Soil redox declined as marsh elevation decreased, with lower soil nitrate and higher ferrous iron in the low marsh compared to the mid and high marshes (P < 0.001 for both). In addition, soil oxygen concentrations were lower in the low and mid-marshes relative to the high marsh (P < 0.001). Net N2O fluxes differed significantly among marsh zones (P = 0.009), averaging 9.8 +/- 5.4 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), -2.2 +/- 0.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), and 0.67 +/- 0.57 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) in the low, mid, and high marshes, respectively. Both net N2O release and uptake were observed in the low and high marshes, but the mid-marsh was consistently a net N2O sink. Gross N2O production was highest in the low marsh and lowest in the mid-marsh (P = 0.02), whereas gross N2O consumption did not differ among marsh zones. Thus, variability in gross N2O production rates drove the differences in net N2O flux among marsh zones. Our results suggest that future studies should focus on elucidating controls on the processes producing, rather than consuming, N2O in salt marshes to improve our predictions of changes in net N2O fluxes caused by future sea level rise.

AB  - Oysters are ecosystem engineers in marine ecosystems, but the functions of oyster shell deposits in intertidal salt marshes are not well understood. The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus, and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, regardless of neighbor treatments, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus, and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities.

AB  - contains 40% of the lower 48 United States coastal and estuarine wetlands and also has the highest rates of wetland loss, similar to 80% of the nation's total. Approximately, 4900 km(2) of coastal land in Louisiana has been lost since 1930. Our study location, Barataria Bay, has one of the highest coastal wetland erosion rates in the nation, at similar to 41 km(2)y(-1) and therefore is a high priority for wetland restoration activities. Sandy sediment dredged from the bed of the Mississippi River was placed at targeted locations in Barataria Bayin an effort to restore and protect coastal Louisiana marshes. This study sought to determine how comparable these dredged river-sediment marsh soils are to those of the surrounding natural marshes in Barataria Bay. Percent organic matter in the created marsh was 11.6% of the natural marsh. Extractable ammonium and extractable nitrate in the created marsh soils were 15.4% and 8.75% of the natural marsh. In the created marsh, the beta-glucosidase enzyme activity was 10.3% and soil oxygen demand was 11.2% of the natural marsh, reflecting significantly lower soil microbial processes within the created marshsites. Associated ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and nutrient availability for support of primary production, are consequently significantly lower in the newly created wetland soil. These data provide a baseline for monitoring and eventual determination of the trajectory for development of microbial-driven ecosystem services of created wetlands using dredged river sediment.

AB  - Salt marshes are widely distributed in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia with their own distinct vegetation. The objective of this study were to study the effect of soil properties on characteristics of Halopeplis perfoliata community and plant response to environmental conditions of the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. The study area is located at five sites: Ras Tanura, Syhat, Dammam, Al-Uqair and Salwah of the Arabian Gulf Coastal salt marshes in eastern province of Saudi Arabia where the plants grows under the natural environmental condition. Plant samples and soil of H. perfoliata succulent (halophyte) collected from the five sites. Several soil concentrations were determined such as electric conductivity (EC), organic carbon (O.C.), Na+, Cl-, So(4), K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. The highest concentrations of the ions of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in soil samples were found in Dammam site compared with the other sites, where Cl is the major ion followed by Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+. The involvement of photosynthetic pigments, and proline investigated. Values of TWC and RWC and photosynthetic pigment fractions content (chl. a, chl. b and carotenoids) from the plants obtained from Dammam were higher. In this study proline contents increased significantly in the leaves of H. perfoliata as the salt concentration increased. A total of 57 plants species were identified in all the five study site. The life forms of the studied plant spices exhibit a wide variation, perennial shrub (PSH) were the dominate growth form (63.16 %). This research suggests that H. perfoliata could remove salt from soil.

AB  - This review evaluates the importance of plants and associated biological processes in determining the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise. Coastal wetlands occur across a broad sedimentary continuum from minerogenic to biogenic, providing an opportunity to examine the relative importance of biological processes in wetland resilience to sea-level rise. We explore how plants influence sediment accretion, elevation capital (vertical position in the tidal frame), and compaction or erosion of deposited material. We focus on salt marsh and mangrove wetlands, which occupy a similar physiographic niche and display similar physical and biological controls on resilience to sea-level rise. In both habitats, plants stabilize emergent mudflats and help sustain the wetland position in the tidal frame relative to ocean height through both surface and subsurface process controls on soil elevation. Plants influence soil elevations by modifying (1) mineral sediment deposition and retention, (2) organic matter contributions to soil volume, and (3) resistance to compaction and erosion. Recognition of the importance of plants in coastal wetland resilience to sea-level rise is key to accurate predictions about the future fate of salt marshes and mangrove forests and for development of effective management and restoration plans.

AB  - To determine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) sources in Southern California coastal waters, optical properties of a river outlet and adjacent tidally flushed salt marshes were monitored (dry season; June July 2001). Average absorption coefficients doubled at ebb vs. flood tides (4.8 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.9 m(-1); 300 nm), suggesting significant salt marsh CDOM inputs into coastal waters. Average spectral slopes were not statistically different for any sites or tides (0.010 +/- 0.002 nm(-1)), consistent with salt marsh CDOM dominating coastal waters. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) at ebb tide showed contributions from terrestrial, protein, and marine humic-like peaks, suggesting production and output of these materials from the marsh. A marine humic signal at the river outlet during an offshore upwelling event indicated an additional sporadic nonmarsh marine humic-like source. EEMs of six common salt marsh plant leachates showed protein, terrestrial, and marine humic-like peaks. To estimate CDOM photodegradation in the marsh, fluorescence intensity decays from photobleaching experiments were fit to first-order kinetics. Most humic peaks degraded with a half-life of t(1/2) = 10-20 h, which overlaps the estimated residence time of water in the marshes (similar to 12 h). Most protein peaks were resistant to photodegradation, suggesting that the low levels of protein vs. humic-like material measured in natural waters was due to rapid bioutilization of proteinaceous material. The rapid photodegradation of plant leachate humic material and the low spectral slopes for the field sites suggest that marsh sediments would be an important source of CDOM.

AB  - Marine species with planktonic larvae often have high spatial and temporal variation in recruitment that leads to subsequent variation in the ecology of benthic adults. Using a combination of published and unpublished data, we compared the population structure of the salt marsh snail, Littoraria irrorata, between the South Atlantic Bight and the Gulf Coast of the United States to infer geographic differences in recruitment and to test the hypothesis that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to widespread recruitment failure of L. irrorata in Louisiana in 2010. Size-frequency distributions in both ecoregions were bimodal, with troughs in the distributions consistent with a transition from sub-adults to adults at similar to 13 mm in shell length as reported in the literature; however, adult snails reached larger sizes in the Gulf Coast. The ratio of sub-adults to adults was 1.5-2 times greater in the South Atlantic Bight than the Gulf Coast, consistent with higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight. Higher recruitment rates in the South Atlantic Bight could contribute to higher snail densities and reduced adult growth in this region. The ratio of sub-adults to adults in Louisiana was lower in 2011 than in previous years, and began to recover in 2012-2014, consistent with widespread recruitment failure in 2010, when large expanses of spilled oil were present in coastal waters. Our results reveal an important difference in the ecology of a key salt marsh invertebrate between the two ecoregions, and also suggest that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have caused widespread recruitment failure in this species and perhaps others with similar planktonic larval stages.

AB  - Human activities have decreased global salt marsh surface area with a subsequent loss in the ecosystem functions they provide. The creation of marshes in terrestrial systems has been used to mitigate this loss in marsh cover. Although these constructed marshes may rapidly recover ecosystem structure, biogeochemical processes may be slow to recover. We compared denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates between a 32-year-old excavation-created salt marsh (CON-2) and a nearby natural reference salt marsh (NAT) to assess the recovery of ecosystem function. These process rates were measured at 5 cm increments to a depth of 25 cm to assess how plant rooting depth and organic matter accumulation impact N-cycling. We found that, for both marshes, denitrification and DNRA declined with depth with the highest rates occurring in the top 10 cm. In both systems, N-retention by DNRA accounted for upwards of 75% of nitrate reduction, but denitrification and DNRA rates were nearly 2x and 3x higher in NAT than CON-2, respectively. Organic matter was 6x lower in CON-2, likely due to limited plant belowground biomass production. However, there was no response to glucose additions, suggesting that the microbial functional community, not substrate limitation, limited nitrate reduction recovery. Response ratios showed that denitrification in CON-2 recovered in surficial sediments where belowground biomass was highest, even though biomass recovery was minimal. This indicates that although recovery of ecosystem function was constrained, it occurred on a faster trajectory than that of ecosystem structure.

AB  - Salt marshes provide important regulating ecosystem services, including natural flood defence and carbon sequestration, which adds value to restoration and biodiversity offsetting schemes. This study evaluates the success of salt marsh restoration using a Regulated Tidal Exchange (RTE) system in SW England, i.e., a self-regulating tidal gate (SRT), in controlling the partial saline inundation of a 14-ha area of former salt marsh reclaimed for agriculture in 1760. A combination of (a) direct hydrodynamic monitoring of water and sediment flux and (b) repeat surveys to evaluate morphological and ecological (plants and foraminifera) changes over a 5-year period, was implemented immediately following SRT commissioning. Morphological changes were limited to the proximity of the SRT system due to limited sediment influx yielding sedimentation rates that were an order of magnitude below a nearby natural marsh. Ecological change to an ephemeral salt marsh community was only detected after 5 years of inundation cycles, with the delayed response attributed to (a) an initial limited tidal inundation due to conservative SRT settings, followed by (b) excessive inundation due to excessive rainfall and recurring SRT failure in an open position, and (c) a lack of sediment and propagule supply caused by (a) & (b) and the relatively narrow inlet pipe used in the SRT system. While the ecological response under optimum SRT settings was encouraging, the lack of perennial plants and limited foraminifera abundance demonstrated that the marsh was far from reaching natural status. We surmise that this is primarily due to inundation being more rapid than drainage leading to excessive submergence during a tidal cycle. Our study shows that the design of tidal inundation schemes requires a synergistic understanding of core ecological and geomorphological approaches to assess viability and success. We conclude that SRT can be a useful technique for intertidal habitat creation where there are significant site constraints (especially flood risk), but we need to be realistic in our expectations of what it can achieve in terms of delivering a perennial salt marsh community.

AB  - Tidal marshes provide nursery habitats for many commercial nektonic species; thus, determining trophic linkages between tidal marshes and aquatic consumers is important for sustaining fishery production in estuarine ecosystems. We examined stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) in 4 commercial nekton species (Chelon haematocheilus, Synechogobius ommaturus, Lateolabrax maculatus and Exopalaemon carinicauda) in the tidal marshes of the Yangtze River estuary, China. We estimated the frequency and range of potential contribution (0 to 100%) from different food sources (benthic microalgae, suspended particulate organic matter, the invasive C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora and native C-3 plants Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) to the nektonic consumers, and then pooled the contributions for primary producers with similar isotope values (giving 3 groups: microalgae, invasive C-4 plant and native C-3 plants). Marsh vascular plants and microalgae were at the base of the food web supporting these nektonic species. For C. haematocheilus and S. ommaturus, vascular plants constituted a larger fraction of their carbon source than microalgae. S. alterniflora contributed more than 50% of their total organic carbon and was more important than the native C-3 plants. For L. maculatus and E. carinicauda, intermediate delta C-13 values precluded definitive assignment of a major carbon source. We have shown that tidal marshes provide important food sources for some dominant estuarine nektonic species, and that the exotic plant S. alterniflora has been incorporated into aquatic food webs of the Yangtze River estuary.

AB  - Coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests and salt marshes provide a range of important benefits to people, broadly defined as ecosystem services. These include provisioning services such as fuelwood and food, regulating services such as carbon sequestration and wave attenuation, and various tangible and intangible cultural services. However, strong negative perceptions of coastal wetlands also exist, often driven by the perceived or actual ecosystem disservices that they also produce. These can include odour, a sense of danger, and their real or perceived role in vector and disease transmission (e.g. malaria). This review provides an introduction to the ecosystem services and disservices concepts and highlights the broad range of services and chdisservices provided by mangrove forests and salt marshes. Importantly, we discuss the key implications of ecosystem services and disservices for the management of these coastal ecosystems. Ultimately, a clear binary does not exist between ecosystem services and disservices; an ecosystem service to one stakeholder can be viewed as a disservice to another, or a service can change seasonally into a disservice, and vice versa. It is not enough to only consider the beneficial ecosystem services that coastal wetlands provide: instead, we need to provide a balanced view of coastal wetlands that incorporates the complexities that exist in how humans relate to and interact with them.

AB  - We examined the response of a salt marsh food web to increases in nutrients at 19 coastal sites in Georgia. Fertilization increased the nitrogen content of the two dominant plants, Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, indicating that added nutrients were available to and taken up by both species. Fertilization increased Spartina cover, height, and biomass and Juncus height, but led to decreases in Juncus cover and biomass. Fertilization increased abundances of herbivores (grasshoppers) and herbivore damage, but had little effect on decomposers (fungi), and no effect on detritivores (snails). In the laboratory, herbivores and detritivores did not show a feeding preference for fertilized versus control plants of either species, nor did detritivores grow more rapidly on fertilized versus control plants, suggesting that changes in herbivore abundance in the field were driven more by plant size or appearance than by plant nutritional quality. Community patterns in control plots varied predictably among sites (i.e., 17 of 20 regression models examining variation in biological variables across sites were significant), but variation in the effects of fertilization across sites could not be easily predicted (i.e., only 6 of 20 models were significant). Natural variation among sites was typically similar or greater than impacts of fertilization when both were assessed using the coefficient of variation. Overall, these results suggest that eutrophication of salt marshes is likely to have stronger impacts on plants and herbivores than on decomposers and detritivores, and that impacts at any particular site might be hard to distinguish from natural variation among sites.

AB  - The productivity gradient between adjacent habitats can fluctuate over time due to seasonal cycles and lead to both habitats being alternately subsidized. Although this process is well known for prey subsidies in stream-riparian forest ecotones, few studies are available for other systems or subsidy types. Moreover, the effects of transport intensity on this expected alternate subsidy exchange are still poorly understood. We assessed whether subsidy input and allochthonous carbon assimilation by resident benthic invertebrates alternated between adjacent mangroves and salt marshes during peaks of detritus productivity (summer and winter, respectively) in a subtropical estuary, by using detritus trapping techniques and stable isotope ratios. Sampling was performed simultaneously in the sheltered (inner sector) and exposed (outer sector) regions of the estuary to assess the influence of different physical conditions on the intensity of subsidy flow. Transport of mangrove litter into the salt marsh occurred mainly in the summer in both sectors; however, most of the litter remained trapped in the marsh boundary. The mixing model also showed that there was little influence of allochthonous carbon in the diet of salt marsh benthic invertebrates. Marsh litter supply to mangroves did not vary significantly between seasons but was significantly higher in the outer than in the inner sector. Likewise, the mixing model showed great contribution of salt marsh carbon to the diet of benthic invertebrates from the outer-sector mangroves, whereas autochthonous carbon predominated in those from the inner mangroves. Our findings reinforce the model that trophic connectivity relies on the relative proportion of allochthonous (subsidy) and autochthonous resources rather than only on asymmetric productivity between habitats. Differences in the proportion of resources result from interaction among productivity, permeability, and transport vectors that lead to many states of trophic connectivity.

AB  - Precise and rapid analyses of greenhouse gases (GHGs) will advance understanding of the net climatic forcing of coastal marsh ecosystems. We examined the ability of a cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer (Model G2508, Picarro) to measure carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in real-time from coastal marshes through comparisons with a Shimadzu GC-2014 ( GC) in a marsh mesocosm experiment and with a similar laser-based N2O analyzer (Model N2O/CO, Los Gatos Research) in both mesocosm and field experiments. Minimum (analytical) detectable fluxes for all gases were more than one order of magnitude lower for the Picarro than the GC. In mesocosms, the Picarro analyzer detected several CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes that the GC could not, but larger N2O fluxes (218-409 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were similar between analyzers. Minimum detectable fluxes for the Picarro were 1 order of magnitude higher than the Los Gatos analyzer for N2O. The Picarro and Los Gatos N2O fluxes (3-132 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) differed in two mesocosm nitrogen addition experiments, but were similar in a mesocosm with larger N2O fluxes (326-491 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). In a field comparison, Picarro and Los Gatos N2O fluxes (1362 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) differed in plots receiving low nitrogen loads but were similar in plots with higher nitrogen loads and fluxes roughly double in magnitude. Both the Picarro and Los Gatos analyzers offer efficient and precise alternatives to GC-based methods, but the former uniquely enables simultaneous measurements of three major GHGs in coastal marshes.

AB  - Aims
   Although many studies have reported net gains of soil organic carbon (SOC) after afforestation on croplands, this is uncertain for Chinese paddy rice croplands. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of afforestation of paddy rice croplands on SOC sequestration and soil respiration (R-s). Such knowledge would improve our understanding of the effectiveness of various land use options on greenhouse gas mitigation in China.
   Methods
   The investigation was conducted on the Chongming Island, north subtropical China. Field sites were reclaimed from coastal salt marshes in the 1960s, and soils were homogeneous with simple land use histories. SOC stocks and R-s levels were monitored over one year in a paddy rice cropland, an evergreen and a deciduous broad-leaved plantation established on previous paddy fields and a reference fallow land site never cultivated. Laboratory incubation of soil under fast-changing temperatures was used to compare the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC decomposition across land uses.
   Important Findings
   After 15-20 years of afforestation on paddy fields, SOC concentration only slightly increased at the depth of 0-5 cm but decreased in deeper layers, which resulted in a net loss of SOC stock in the top 40 cm. Seasonal increase of SOC was observed during the rice-growing period in croplands but not in afforested soils, suggesting a stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping. However, SOC sequestered under cropping was more labile, as indicated by its higher contents of dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass. Also, paddy soils had higher annual R-s than afforested soils; R-s abruptly increased after paddy fields were drained and plowed and remained distinctively high throughout the dry farming period. Laboratory incubation revealed that paddy soils had a much higher Q(10) of SOC decomposition than afforested soils.. Given that temperature was the primary controller of R-s in this region, it was concluded that despite the stronger SOC sequestration by paddy rice cropping, its SOC was less stable than in afforested systems and might be more easily released into the atmosphere under global warming.

AB  - The hydrological regime is the dominant factor associated with the degradation and restoration of inland salt marshes in Northeast China. This study investigates whether alternate flooding-drought conditions could be used to actively restore degraded inland salt marshes with the native plant Phragmites australis. Pot experiments were designed to examine changes in the growth and physiology of P. australis, as well as the saline-alkaline soil characteristics, in response to different hydrological regimes, alternate flooding-drought treatments, and single treatments of moisture, flooding, and drought. After 4 months of treatments, the P. australis population that grew in alternate flooding-drought conditions exhibited substantially more biomass accumulation and less Na+ absorption compared with the single treatments of moisture, flooding, and drought. Photosynthesis physiology served as regulating and adaptive responses to different water regimes, with increased values after the short-term flooding, long-term drought, and flooding-drought cycles. In addition, the saline-alkaline soil properties changed in response to the flooding-drought cycles. The flooding-drought cycles increased organic matter and total nitrogen contents, but decreased pH, electrical conductivity, and saline ion levels. Plant growth and saline-alkaline soil were improved by flooding-drought cycles (not drought-flooding cycles), which suggests that this may be an effective approach for restoration inland salt marshes.

AB  - Phragmites australis has been invading Spartina-alterniflora-dominated salt marshes throughout the mid-Atlantic. Although, Phragmites has high rates of primary production, it is not known whether this species supports lower trophic levels of a marsh food web in the same manner as Spartina. Using several related photochemical and biological assays, we compared patterns of organic matter flow of plant primary production through a key salt marsh metazoan, the ribbed mussel (Geukensia demissa), using a bacterial intermediate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was derived from plants collected from a Delaware Bay salt marsh and grown in the laboratory with C-14-CO2. Bacterial utilization of plant-derived DOM measured as carbon mineralization revealed that both species provided bioavailable DOM to native salt marsh bacteria. Total carbon mineralization after 19 days was higher for Spartina treatments (36% (CO2)-C-14 +/- 3 SE) compared with Phragmites treatments (29% +/- 2 SE; Wilcoxon-Kruskal-Wallis rank sums test, P < 0.01). Pre-exposing DOM to natural sunlight only enhanced or decreased bioavailability of the DOM to the bacterioplankton during initial measurements (e.g., 7 days or less) but these differences were not significant over the course of the incubations. Mixtures of C-14-labeled bacterioplankton (and possibly organic flocs) from C-14-DOM treatments were cleared by G. demissa at similar rates between Spartina and Phragmites treatments. Moreover, C-14 assimilation efficiencies for material ingested by mussels were high for both plant sources ranging from 74% to 90% and not significantly different between plant sources. Sunlight exposure did not affect the nutritional value of the bacterioplankton DOM assemblage for mussels. There are many possible trophic and habitat differences between Spartina- and Phragmites-dominated marshes that could affect G. demissa but the fate of vascular plant dissolved organic carbon in the DOM to bacterioplankton to mussel trophic pathway appears comparable between these marsh types.

AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from similar to 10,500 km(2) (1980s) to similar to 6700 km(2) (2010s), say similar to 1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached similar to 9700 km(2), including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (similar to 99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (similar to 31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as similar to 8 billion USD yr(-1) with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little information is available on denitrification potential of marsh soils in natural saline-alkaline wetlands. The denitrification potentials of an open wetland in the floodplain (Erbaifangzi wetland) and a closed wetland (Fulaowenpao wetland) in backwater areas in Jilin Province of Northeast China were monitored by an anaerobic incubation at 30A degrees C for 25 days. Our results showed that the relative denitrification index (RDI) increased gradually with incubation time, and showed a rapid increase in the first 5 days of incubation. The RDI values declined quickly from surface soils to subsurface soils and then kept a small change in deeper soils along soil profiles over the incubation time. Denitrification proceeded much faster in the top 20 cm soils of open wetland than in the closed wetland, whereas no significant differences in RDI values were observed in deeper soils between both wetlands. The RDIs were significantly negatively correlated with bulk density and sand content, while a significantly positive correlation with clay content, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorous. The maximum net NO3 (-)-N loss through denitrification in 1 m depth were higher in the open wetland than the closed wetland with higher soil pH values. Future research should be focused on understanding the influencing mechanisms of soil alkalinity.

AB  - Ecosystems worldwide are experiencing the effects of climate change, and estuaries and salt marshes are no exception. The plant community will be one of the most affected elements by these climatic shifts, both in terms of structure and dynamics, with undeniable effects on its productivity. This thesis aims to study the effects of climate change on the marsh community dynamics, structure and productivity but also on its biogeochemical cycles and implications at the ecosystem level. Although special attention was given to primary productivity and plant physiology, a multidisciplinary approach was undertaken using both field assessments and mesocosmos trials. The results point out that these physically connected climatic changes are not only interconnected in a physical way but also at an ecological level. Mediterranean marshes will be more severely affected on their foundations, putting the entire ecosystem at risk and prone to climate change side effects and/or to synergistic events. The majority of the evaluated climatic changes have more negative impacts on the marsh pioneer species, affecting inevitably marsh establishment and expansion. Although to a lesser extent, the upper and middle marsh halophytes will also suffer from these climate-driven negative impacts. In addition, the appearance of resistant nonindigenous species (NIS) will add an increased threat to the marsh. The reduction of the pioneer zone in a large extension together with a middle marsh fragilization will open new ecological niches for the colonization of resistant NIS, imposing serious shifts in the marsh structure, dynamics and services provided to the estuarine ecosystem. This is even more evident when a holistic approach is undertaken focusing not only on plant physiology but also the marsh biogeochemistry and estuarine hydrological features. These evidences point out the need to adopt new management efforts, highlighting the desired marsh attributes and ecosystem services in the face of human activities that threaten salt marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Open top chambers (OTCs) are a commonly used passive warming technique in experimental warming studies. OTCs have been shown to be effective in multiple types of terrestrial systems, but their utility in wetland environments remains uncertain. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of using OTCs to warm a temperate salt marsh across diurnal and seasonal cycles. We found that OTCs are effective at warming air temperatures on the marsh, with average air temperatures 1.6 +/- 0.007 degrees C and 1.1 +/- 0.006 degrees C warmer within the high and low marsh, respectively over a 16-month period. In contrast, OTCs were ineffective at warming sediments, especially during the day. In fact, sediment temperatures within the OTC were cooler during the day relative to ambient conditions. Such daytime warming of air, but cooling of sediments relative to ambient conditions resulted in a significant decoupling of above and belowground temperatures in the marsh (r = -0.99 and -0.82 on low and high marsh, respectively). Our data indicate that shading by OTCs was responsible for the daytime sediment cooling relative to ambient conditions during most of the year, as incoming solar radiation was reduced by 30% within OTCs. Wet sediments require more energy to heat than the air due to their higher specific heat capacity. Thus, reductions in radiation by OTCs prevented effective warming of sediments, but still allowed for the warming of air. In turn, we conclude that OTCs are not an effective method to experimentally warm tidal marsh sediments.

AB  - The predepositional stability of lignin in the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora was examined in two different degradation studies: one was a traditional litterbag study carried out using post-senescent brown leaves in a North Carolina marsh creek, and the other was a study in which senescing, standing plants were tagged and allowed to undergo in situ degradation in a Sapelo Island, Georgia, salt marsh. Based on results from lignin oxidation product (LOP) analysis of leaves, lignin in the S. alterniflora was shown to be significantly degraded in both studies, with 13 +/- 2% and 25 +/- 12% of the total lignin mass loss occurring over the 496-day litterbag and 146-day tagged studies, respectively.
   A comparison of the results from both studies suggests that most of the calculated lignin loss (>90%) occurs early in the degradation history of the plant, with a significant portion occurring while the plant is still standing in the salt marsh. Further detailed evaluation of this loss demonstrates that selective lignin degradation occurs in S. alterniflora, deriving from the preferential loss of labile lignin moieties. The most labile component, trans-ferulic acid, accounted for 57% and 82% of the total lignin loss in the litterbag and tagged studies, respectively, based on normalization to syringyl-phenol concentrations. Comparison of these two data sets supports the following approximate lignin stability sequence for S. alterniflora: S congruent-to Ca congruent-to V > P much greater than Fa. Based on measured changes in both the lignin mass loss and the LOP acid/aldehyde ratio, as well as evidence suggesting that degradation occurred under oxic conditions, it is proposed that aromatic ring cleavage was the predominant mechanism of lignin degradation in both studies.
   In light of these results and those from other recent lignin degradation studies, we discuss the geochemical consequences regarding the usefulness of lignin oxidation products as quantitative tracers of vascular plant-derived organic matter being transported, deposited, and buried in aquatic environments.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that the evolution of animals during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition stimulated the burial of phosphorus in marine sediments. This assumption is centrally based on data compilations from marine sediments deposited under oxic and anoxic bottom waters. Since anoxia excludes the presence of infauna and sediment reworking, the observed differences in P burial are assumed to be driven by the presence of bioturbators. This reasoning however ignores the potentially confounding impact of bottom-water oxygenation on phosphorus burial. Here, our goal is to test the idea that bioturbation increases the burial of organic and inorganic phosphorus (P-org and P-inorg, respectively) while accounting for bottom-water oxygenation. We present solid-phase phosphorus speciation data from salt marsh ponds with and without bioturbation (Blakeney salt marsh, Norfolk, UK). In both cases, the pond sediments are exposed to oxygenated bottom waters, and so the only difference is the presence or absence of bioturbating macrofauna. Our data reveal that the rate of P-org and P-inorg burial are indistinguishable between bioturbated and non-bioturbated sediments. A large terrestrial fraction of organic matter and higher sedimentation velocity than generally found in marine sediments (0.3 +/- 0.1 cm yr(-1)) may partially impact these results. However, the absence of a clear effect of bioturbation on total P burial puts into question the presumed importance of bioturbation for phosphorus burial.

AB  - In recent years, artificial establishment of Spartina alterniflora marshes has become a common method for mitigating impacts to salt marsh systems. The vegetative component of artificially established salt marshes has been examined in several studies, but relatively little is known about the other aspects of these systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the infaunal community of artificially established salt marshes. Infauna were sampled from pairs of artificially established (AE) salt marshes and nearby natural marshes at six sites along the North Carolina coast. The AE marshes ranged in age from 1 yr to 17 yr. Total infaunal density, density of dominant taxa, and community trophic structure (proportions of subsurface-deposit feeders, surface-deposit and suspension feeders, and carnivores) were compared between the two types of marsh to assess infaunal community development in AE marshes. Overall, the two marsh types had similar component organisms and proportions of trophic groups, but total density and densities within trophic groupings were lower in the AE marshes. Soil organic matter content of the natural marshes was nearly twice that of the AE marshes, and is a possible cause for the higher infaunal densities observed in the natural marshes. Using the same three criteria, comparisons of the natural and AE marshes at each of the six locations revealed varying degrees of similarity. Similarity of each AE marsh to its natural marsh control appeared to be influenced by differences in environmental factors between locations more than by AE marsh age. Functional infaunal habitat convergence of an AE marsh with a natural marsh somewhere within its biogeographical region is probable, but success in duplicating the infaunal community of a particular natural marsh is contingent upon the developmental age of the natural marsh and the presence and interaction of site-specific factors.

AB  - Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Fe in water, sediment and tissue of the emergent macrophyte Schoenoplectus californicus were studied in three coastal environments differing in aquatic chemistry and tide amplitude: a deltaic floodplain marsh, a coastal vegetated strip of the river and a tidal marsh at the south margin of the Rio de la Plata Estuary. Metal content in water was not significantly different between the river and the floodplain marsh. Metal content in sediments showed higher values in the marshes than in the river, suggesting a retention in the marsh. Except for Cu, the highest metal content in sediments and water was observed in the tidal marsh. Pb in plants was undetectable. Metal content was higher in rhizomes, except Cr, which was mainly stored in stems. Rhizome metal content was higher in the river, probably related to the higher redox potential of its sediments. Inflorescence metal content was higher in the marshes: the highest Zn, Cr and Fe contents were measured in the tidal marsh; the highest Cu content was in the floodplain marsh, together with the highest organic matter content of the sediments. Zn, Cr and Fe increased in standing drying stems and in inflorescences in late fall. Inflorescences showed the highest metal content after seeds had been released.

AB  - Oligochaetes (Annelida) are active bioturbators that can be present in high densities in the transition zone between intertidal flats and salt marshes, though their occurrence and functional role remain understudied. This study aimed to clarify the biogeomorphic role of oligochaete bioturbation in facilitating or hindering vegetation establishment. Two microcosm experiments were performed to assess the effect of oligochaete bioturbation on sediment properties, oxidation depth, algal biomass, seed distribution, and germination success of pioneer species Salicornia spp. Oligochaetes created burrow networks in the sediment matrix, which, together with upward conveyor belt feeding, lead to substrate mixing. Sediment reworking rates of oligochaetes were compared with those of polychaete macrofauna. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation of burrows can stimulate resource flows into the sediment. Oxidation depth increased almost tenfold in the presence of oligochaetes. Their bioturbation did not seem to affect sediment properties such as dry bulk density, porosity, and organic matter content. Sediment reworking, however, significantly reduced algal biomass at the surface with possible cascading effects on sediment stability and erodibility. Oligochaete conveyor belt feeding buried Salicornia spp. seeds until below the critical germination depth, thus negatively affecting Salicornia spp. germination and seedling establishment. Our study indicates that small, though numerous, oligochaete bioturbators may reduce lateral expansion potential of salt marshes by hindering the establishment of pioneer vegetation in the transition zone. Additionally, in dynamic fine-grained habitats, these oligochaetes have the feature to quickly oxygenate the sediment top layer.

AB  - Tidal marshes store large amounts of carbon; however, little is known about the patterns, magnitudes, and biophysical drivers that regulate CO2 efflux from these ecosystems. Due to harsh environmental conditions (e.g., flooding), it is difficult to measure continuous soil CO2 efflux in tidal marshes. These data are necessary to inform empirical and process-based models and to better quantify carbon budgets. We performed automated (30 min) and manual (bi-monthly) soil CO2 efflux measurements, for -20 months, at two sites in a temperate tidal marsh: tall Spartina (TS; dominated by S. cynosuroides) and short Spartina (SS; dominated by S. alterniflora). These measurements were coupled with water quality, canopy spectral reflectance, and meteorological measurements. There were no consistent diel patterns of soil CO2 efflux, suggesting a decoupling of soil CO2 efflux with diel variations in temperature and tides (i.e., water level) showing a hysteresis effect. Mean soil CO2 efflux was significantly higher at SS (2.15 +/- 1.60 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) than at TS (0.55 +/- 0.80 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), highlighting distinct biogeochemical spatial variability. At the annual scale, air temperature explained >50% of the variability in soil CO2 efflux at both sites; and water level and salinity were secondary drivers of soil CO2 efflux at SS and TS, respectively. Annual soil CO2 efflux varied from 287-876 to 153-211 g C m(-2) y(-1) at SS and TS, respectively, but manual measurements underestimated the annual flux by <67% at SS and <23% at TS. These results suggest that measuring and modeling diel soil CO2 efflux variability in tidal marshes may be more challenging than previously expected and highlight large discrepancies between manual and automated soil CO2 efflux measurements. New technical approaches are needed to implement long-term automated measurements of soil CO2 efflux across wetlands to properly estimate the carbon balance of these ecosystems.

AB  - Nitrogen retention by salt marshes has been suggested as a means of mitigating the delivery of land-derived nitrogen loads to coastal waters. As land-derived nitrogen loads increase, it is unclear whether there is an upper limit to the amount of nitrogen retained by salt marshes. A long-term fertilization study in the Great Sippewissett Marsh on Cape Cod, USA, has been examining the changes to salt marsh vegetation and sediment processes as a result of increased nitrogen loading. To determine whether decadal-scale changes in nitrogen loading and sources are recorded in salt marsh sediments, we examined sediment delta N-15 and % N profiles from below low and high marsh vegetation in control and fertilized plots in Great Sippewissett Marsh. As expected, we found little change in delta N-15 values in control plots. Nitrogen burial, calculated using % N values in bulk sediments, was higher in fertilized plots, but did not increase over time. However, delta N-15 values in fertilized plots were higher than in control plots and increased over time, becoming heavier than the source fertilizer and continuing to increase linearly. The continuous increase in sediment delta N-15 values in fertilized plots over the fertilizer delta N-15 value suggests that de nitrifying bacteria are responding to the increased nitrogen load and fractionating the available nitrogen. The nitrogen that remained unaccounted for by burial led us to conclude that 47 to 80% of the fertilizer nitrogen was denitrified.

AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation plays an important role in maintaining ecological function and is a key factor affecting the soil bacterial community. Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Yancheng tidal marsh to stabilize the sediments and gradually replaced the native plants. However, the changes in the soil bacterial community profile caused by S. alterniflora invasion are poorly characterized. Here, we used MiSeq sequencing to compare the composition of the bacterial community in soil at different depths under exotic S. alterniflora (SA), native Phragmites australis (PA), and native Suaeda salsa (SS). The results showed that the pH value was lower, but the salinity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and number of 16S rRNA genes were higher in SA soils than in PA and SS soils. Overall, Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, followed by Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Nitrospirae. Anaerolineae in the Chloroflexi phylum showed the greatest difference based on vegetation, accounting for 14.4% of the overall bacterial community in SA soils but only about 3.8% of those in PA and SS soils. The composition, interaction, and predicted functional profiles of the bacterial community in SA soils were significantly different from those in PA and SS soils, especially for functions related to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles. Salinity was negatively correlated with the Shannon index and accounted for 37.7% of the total variation in the bacterial community, making it the most important environmental factor. Our results showed the differences in bacterial community composition among different vegetation types and soil depths in the Yancheng tidal marsh, which provides a microbial basis for a better understanding of the ecological functions in this ecosystem.

AB  - Ecogeomorphic characteristics of tidal marshes are strongly related to their elevation with respect to the mean sea level. Predicting the long-term evolution and resilience of such ecosystems in times of rapid natural and anthropogenic climate changes is of critical importance. The notion that the tidal marsh elevation is the result of feedbacks between vegetation dynamics, sediment fluxes, natural consolidation, and sea-level changes is widely recognized. However, the interaction of these processes has been poorly investigated until now. This contribution aims at presenting a novel numerical model to simulate the above-surface and subsurface coupled dynamics of a tidal landscape in a 2-D-framework, with the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) acting as an external stressor. A biomorphological model is used to compute deposition fluxes, which depends on topography and availability of organic/inorganic sediments. The outcome is used as forcing term in a physically based geomechanical model to simulate the consolidation of the marsh body that, in turn, influences sediment fluxes by acting on the platform elevation. The results demonstrate how compaction of the marsh body can crucially affect the resilience of tidal landforms to RSLR accelerations. With normal sediment concentration in coastal waters (10< C-0 <100 mg/l), if minerogenic (stiff) deposits prevail, a tidal marsh is capable of maintaining its elevation relative to mean sea level independently of RSLR (at least up to 10 mm/yr). When the marsh is composed of a large percentage of more compressible organic matter, the landform resilience is much more dependent on RSLR, implying higher vulnerability with respect to future climate changes.

AB  - Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes were used to characterize the food webs (i.e., sources of carbon and trophic status of consumers) in Tijuana Estuary and San Dieguito Lagoon. Producer groups were most clearly differentiated by carbon, then by sulfur, and least clearly by nitrogen isotope measurements. Consumer N-15 isotopic enrichment suggested that there are four trophic levels in the Tijuana Estuary food web and three in San Dieguito Lagoon. A significant difference in multiple isotope ratio distributions of fishes between wetlands suggested that the food web of San Dieguito Lagoon is less complex than that of Tijuana Estuary. Associations among sources and consumers indicated that inputs from intertidal macroalgae, marsh microalgae, and Spartina foliosa provide the organic matter that supports invertebrates, fishes, and the light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes). These three producers occupy tidal channels, low salt marsh, and mid salt marsh habitats. The only consumer sampled that appears dependent upon primary productivity from high salt marsh habitat is the sera (Porzana carolina). Two- and three-source mixing models identified Spartina as the major organic matter source for fishes, and macroalgae for invertebrates and the light-footed clapper rail in Tijuana Estuary. In San Dieguito Lagoon, a system lacking Spartina, inputs of macroalgae and microalgae support fishes. Salicornia virginica, S. subterminalis, Monanthochloe littoralis, sewage-derived organic matter, and suspended particulate organic matter were deductively excluded as dominant, direct influences on the food web. The demonstration of a salt marsh-channel linkage in these systems affirms that these habitats should be managed as a single ecosystem and that the restoration of intertidal marshes for endangered birds and other biota is compatible with enhancement of coastal fish populations; heretofore, these have been considered to be competing objectives.

AB  - Historically, coastal "blue carbon" ecosystems (tidal marshes, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) have been impacted and degraded by human intervention, mainly in the form of land acquisition. With increasing recognition of the role of blue carbon ecosystems in climate mitigation, protecting and rehabilitating these ecosystems becomes increasingly more important. This study evaluated the potential carbon gains from rehabilitating a degraded coastal tidal marsh site in south-eastern Australia. Tidal exchange at the study site had been restricted by the construction of earthen barriers for the purpose of reclaiming land for commercial salt production. Analysis of sediment cores (elemental carbon and Pb-210 dating) revealed that the site had stopped accumulating carbon since it had been converted to salt ponds 65 years earlier. In contrast, nearby recovered ("control") tidal marsh areas are still accumulating carbon at relatively high rates (0.54 tons C ha(-1) year(-1)). Using elevation and sea level rise (SLR) data, we estimated the potential future distribution of tidal marsh vegetation if the earthen barrier were removed and tidal exchange was restored to the degraded site. We estimated that the sediment-based carbon gains over the next 50 years after restoring this small site (360 ha) would be 9,000 tons C, which could offset the annual emissions of similar to 7,000 passenger cars at present time (at 4.6 metric tons pa.) or similar to 1,400 Australians. Overall, we recommend that this site is a promising prospect for rehabilitation based on the opportunity for blue carbon additionality, and that the business case for rehabilitation could be bolstered through valuation of other co-benefits, such as nitrogen removal, support to fisheries, sediment stabilization, and enhanced biodiversity.

AB  - Canonical discriminant analysis of the natural carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotopes in tissues of young weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) captured in Delaware Bay was used to infer movements of juveniles and to estimate the utilization of estuarine organic matter in this marine transient species. Two gradients emerged in the data. The first was associated with contributions from tidal salt marsh macrophytes, Spartina alterniflora in the polyhaline lower Bay and Phragmites australis in the brackish upper Bay. The second was associated with the expected change in phytoplankton carbon-isotope values along the salinity gradient in addition to the availability of macrophyte-derived organic matter within the Bay. The separation of the gradients reflected differences in the relative contribution of phytoplankton to weakfish secondary production in open waters versus marsh habitats. As they grew, discrepancies between the anticipated isotopic signatures of juvenile weakfish collected in a specific habitat and their actual signatures were interpreted as down-bay movements based on known life-history patterns. The size-specific differences in the isotopic signatures of weakfish suggested that stable-isotope data can be used to gauge the relative magnitude of marsh-derived organic matter exported from Delaware Bay via movements of juveniles out of the estuary.

AB  - Sources of sedimentary organic matter to a Morse River, Maine (USA) salt marsh over the last 3390 +/- 60 RCYBP (Radiocarbon Years Before Present) are determined using distribution patterns of n-alkanes, bulk carbon isotopic analysis, and compound-specific carbon isotopic analysis. Marsh foraminiferal counts suggest a ubiquitous presence of high marsh and higher-high marsh deposits (dominated by Trochammina macrescens forma macrescens, Trochammina comprimata, and Trochammina inflata), implying deposition from similar to 0.2 m to 0.5 m above mean high water. Distributions of n-alkanes show a primary contribution from higher plants, confirmed by an average chain length value of 27.5 for the core sediments, and carbon preference index values all >3. Many sample depths are dominated by the C-25 alkane. Salicornia depressa and Ruppia maritima have similar n-alkane distributions to many of the salt marsh sediments, and we suggest that one or both of these plants is either an important source to the biomass of the marsh through time, or that another unidentified higher plant source is contributing heavily to the sediment pool. Bacterial degradation or algal inputs to the marsh sediments appear to be minor. Compound-specific carbon isotopic analyses of the C-27 alkane are on average 7.27 parts per thousand depleted relative to bulk values, but the two records are strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.89), suggesting that marsh plants dominate the bulk carbon isotopic signal. Our study underscores the importance of using caution when applying mixing models of plant species to salt marsh sediments, especially when relatively few plants are included in the model.

AB  - Salt marshes provide a range of critical ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Recent recognition of the importance of these ecosystems has led to an interest in restoring marshes that have been degraded by human activities. Tidal restriction from coastal development can alter salt marsh plant and animal communities as well as marsh biogeochemistry. However, much less is known about how tidal restriction, and subsequent tidal restoration, may alter greenhouse gas emissions. Since salt marshes typically have lower emissions of methane than freshwater wetlands, tidal restoration that increases the salinity in a restricted marsh could theoretically improve the net global warming potential of a marsh by lowering methane emissions. In this study, we examined the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide at four temperate salt marshes, three of which had been restricted and subsequently restored. Greenhouse gas fluxes were poorly correlated with environmental parameters (biomass, temperature, moisture, sediment organic content, porewater salinity and pH, etc.) normally considered to be primary drivers of salt marsh biogeochemical processes. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions and uptake were not influenced by the restriction and restoration history of the marshes. Despite comparable salinity, methane emissions in one partially restored marsh were 25 times higher than those in unimpacted reference sites 13+ years after restoration. However, methane emissions from the other restored sites were equal to or significantly lower than those from unimpacted reference sites. This study highlights that we cannot assume recovering ecosystems will function like unimpacted ones, especially if restoration is incomplete.

AB  - The introduction of embankment seawalls to limit the expansion of the exotic C-4 perennial grass Spartina alteniflora Loisel in eastern China's coastal wetlands has more than doubled in the past decades. Previous research focused on the impact of sea embankment reclamation on the soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in salt marshes, whereas no study attempted to assess the impact of sea embankment reclamation on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in such marshes. Here we examined the impact of sea embankment reclamation on GHG stocks and fluxes of an invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis dominated salt marsh in the Dongtai wetlands of China's Jiangsu province. Sea embankment reclamation significantly decreased soil total organic C by 54.0% and total organic N by 73.2%, decreasing plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil salinity in both plants' marsh. It increased CO2 emissions by 38.2% and 13.5%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 34.5% and 37.1%, respectively, in the Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis marshes. The coastal embankment wall also significantly increased N2O emission by 48.9% in the Phragmites australis salt marsh and reduced emissions by 17.2% in the Spartina alterniflora marsh. The fluxes of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 were similar in both restored and unrestored sections, whereas the fluxes of nitrous oxide N2O were substantially different owing to increased nitrate as a result of N-loading. Our findings show that sea embankment reclamation significantly alters coastal marsh potential to sequester C and N, particularly in native Phragmites australis salt marshes. As a result, sea embankment reclamation essentially weakens native and invasive saltmarshes' C and N sinks, potentially depleting C and N sinks in coastal China's wetlands. Stakeholders and policymakers can utilize this scientific evidence to strike a balance between seawall reclamation and invasive plant expansion in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades(1). Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems(2-4), can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks(5-7). Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCE) play an essential role in the global carbon cycle by removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it as organic carbon (OC) in biomass and sediments. However, organic matter (OM) deposition and degradation/preservation processes are poorly understood, especially on the long-term and at molecular scales. We analysed sediment samples from six cores collected in tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses (up to 150 cm long cores spanning up to 10,000 yrs of OC accumulation) from Spencer Gulf (South Australia), by pyrolysis (Py-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS), and we compared the results with elemental and stable isotope data, to decipher OM provenance and to assess degradation/preservation dynamics. The results showed that: (1) the major biopolymers preserved were polysaccharides, polyphenolic moieties (lignin and tannin) and polymethylenic moieties (e.g. cutin, suberin, chlorophyll) with smaller apportions of proteins and resins; (2) the OM originates predominantly from vascular plant materials (in particular lignocellulose) that have been well-preserved, even in some of the oldest sediments; (3) mangroves were found to be the most efficient OC sinks, partially explained by syringyl lignin preservation; (4) seagrasses were shown to store polysaccharide-enriched OM; (5) large proportions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) in surficial tidal marsh and mangrove sediments probably reflect pyrogenic OM from industrial combustion, and; (6) "ecosystem shifts", i.e. mangrove encroachment in tidal marsh and transition from seagrass to mangrove, were detected. Deposition environment and source vegetation control OC sequestration and there is no specific recalcitrant form of OM that is selectively preserved. For the first time, we demonstrate how analytical pyrolysis in combination with stable isotope analysis can be used to reconstruct (palaeo-)ecological shifts between different BCE. This study improves our knowledge on OC accumulation dynamics and the response of BCE to environmental change, which can inform the implementation of strategies for climate change mitigation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine peat formation processes throughout the millennia in four tidal marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Peat cores collected at each site were analyzed for bulk density, loss on ignition, and percent organic carbon. Core data and spline fit age-depth models were used to estimate inorganic sedimentation, organic accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates in the marshes. Bulk density and percent organic matter content of peat fluctuated through time at all sites, suggesting that peat formation processes are dynamic and responsive to watershed conditions. The balance between inorganic sedimentation and organic accumulation at the sites also varied through time, indicating that marshes may rely more strongly on either inorganic or organic matter for peat formation at particular times in their existence. Mean carbon sequestration rates found in this study (0.38-0.79 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) were similar to other long-term estimates for temperate peatlands.

AB  - Iron has profound influence on anaerobic organic matter oxidation and Fe-S-C biogeochemical cycling in tidal marshes. To examine the abundance and speciation of iron, six iron species (poor crystalline Fe(III), crystalline Fe(III), non-sulfidic Fe(II), porewater Fe2+, FeS, and FeS2) were investigated in a cross transect (span = 250 m, depth = similar to 1.2 m) in a tidal marsh of the Min River Estuary in the East China Sea. The results suggested that sediment characteristics, pH, redox condition, conductivity, chloride, sulfate, and organic matter create a highly heterogeneous geochemical framework in the cross transect. Correspondingly, the zonation of iron species differed significantly across the tidal marsh. Poor crystalline Fe(III) (48 +/- 24 mu mol g 1) and crystalline Fe(III) (75 +/- 32 mu mol g 1) accumulated on the surface of the high-tide zone and decreased with elevation. The non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals (140 +/- 61 mu mol g 1) accounted for the largest proportion of the six iron species. The porewater Fe2+ was enriched within the deep layer of the upland region (pH = 6.2-6.5) and exhibited a maximum of 11.49 mM. The aqueous sulfide concentration was below detection. FeS (39 +/- 6 mu mol g 1) and FeS2 (57 +/- 25 mu mol g 1) accumulated closer to the lower extremity. Tidal water brought O-2 and removed certain amounts of dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon, and Fe(III)-bearing particles in an element budget during tidal inundation. Variations of topography, tidal hydrology, seawater intrusion, and organic matter altered the dominant organic matter oxidation pathway and further affected iron mineralization.

AB  - The potential for marsh plants to be vectors in the transport of mercury species was studied in the natural, mature, tidal China Camp salt marsh on San Pablo Bay. The fluxes of organic matter, mercury (THg), and monomethylmercury (MeHg) were studied in natural stands of Spartina foliosa and Salicornia virginica. Seasonal fluxes from the sediment into aboveground biomass of live plants and subsequent transfer into the dead plant community by mortality were measured. Loss of THg and MeHg from the dead plant community through fragmentation, leaching, and excretion were calculated and were similar to net uptake. Seasonal data were added up to calculate annual mass balances. In S. foliosa, annual net production was 1,757 g DW m2, and the annual net uptakes in the aboveground biomass were 305 mu g THg m2 and 5.720 mu g MeHg m-2. In S. virginica, annual net production was 2,117 g DW m2, and the annual net uptakes in aboveground biomass were 99.120 mu g THg m-2 and 1.990 mu g MeHg m-2. Of both plant species studied, S. foliosa had a slightly lower production rate but greater mercury species uptake and loss rates than S. virginica, and, consequently, it is to be expected that S. foliosa matter may affect the local and possibly the regional food web relatively more than S. virginica. However, the actual effects of the input of mercury-species-containing plant-derived particulate matter into the food webs would depend on trophic level, food preference, seasonal cycle of the consumer, total sediment surface area vegetated, location of the vegetation in the marsh landscape, and estuary bay landscape. Since the levels of mercury species in dead plant material greatly exceed those in live plant material (on a dry weight basis), detritivores would ingest greater mercury species concentrations than herbivores, and consumers of S. foliosa would ingest more than consumers of S. virginica. The greatest THg and MeHg losses of both plant species due to mortality and to fragmentation-leaching-excretion occurred in late spring and early autumn, which corresponds to peak MeHg levels observed in sediments of coastal systems of previous studies, suggesting enhanced THg-MeHg export from the marsh to the nearshore sediment.

AB  - Elemental (TOC, TN, C/N) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions were measured for surface sediments, three sediment vibrocores, plants, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from salt marsh of the Changjiang Estuary. The purpose of this study is to characterize the sources of organic matter in sediments and to further elucidate the factors influencing the isotope signature in the salt marsh. Our results indicate that organic matter preserved in the sediments is predominantly controlled by the particulate organic matter in the Changjiang Estuary. The in situ contribution of marsh plants carbon to sediment organic matter is clearest in the high marsh, where the low delta C-13 of the plants (-28.1 parts per thousand) is reflected by a sediment delta C-13 (-24.7 parts per thousand) lower than values found for the low marsh and bare flat sediments (-23.4 parts per thousand and -23.0 parts per thousand, respectively). The effect of grain size on the spatial difference of isotope composition in the marsh sediments is insignificant, based on the observation that similar isotope values are found in different size particles, both for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Nutrient utilization by plant assimilation, however, shows great impact on the surface sediment delta N-15 composition, due to the isotope fractionation. With extensive plant coverage and the consequent low surface water nitrate concentration, delta N-15 values of the high marsh surface sediments show N-15 enrichment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The high marsh in southeast Atlantic coast salt marshes forms a relatively small but ecologically important transition zone between low marsh and the terrestrial shoreline. However, long-term trend data from high marshes are limited to a few studies. Permanent plots established in a high marsh near Waties Island in northeast South Carolina were measured for plant coverage from 2002-2010. At the beginning and at the end of the study, four groups of plots were identified: mixed indicated by Borrichia frutescens, Distichlis spicata, and Fimbristylis castanea; Juncus indicated by Juncus roemerianus; Salicornia indicated by Salicornia virginica; and Spartina indicated by Spartina patens. Ordination of the 2010 plot data and soil analyses produced clear separation of the groups along a single dominant axis with Salicornia and Juncus groups at the high end of a salinity gradient and the Spartina group at the high end of soil organic matter gradient. Comparison of plots classified in 2002 to the same plots in 2010 suggested both stability and change, depending on community classification. Salicornia and Spartina groups were stable. The mixed group experienced a switch in dominance from Distichlis spicata to Borrichia frutescens, whereas the Juncus group had gradually declining importance of Juncus roemerianus and gradually increasing importance of Borrichia frutescens. These data represent patterns and trends in a system and time period not affected by development or influenced by high intensity disturbance, and can be used as a reference for other high marshes in the immediate area experiencing environmental change.

AB  - Subsequent to an initial survey of sediments from five salt marshes along the UK Essex coast, samples were taken from a further two sites in Essex and one in North Norfolk. Sites were selected to assess the impact of sediment sources, particle size distribution and organic carbon content upon organochlorine contamination. The determination of average and median concentrations of insecticides and PCB in sediment from cores to a depth of 35 cm identified a degree of contamination that may be considered background in this area. Two sites, at Two Tree Island (in the Thames estuary) and at Bridgewick on the Dengie peninsula, were found to exhibit enhanced degrees of contamination.
   There was no evidence to link elevated sediment organochlorine concentrations with higher organic carbon content or particle size distribution of the sediments. Distribution of contaminants within sediment particle size fractions, was however, related to the proportion of organic carbon in the < 64 mu m fraction. The most significant factor influencing the degree of contamination with OCL and PCB is likely to be the source of sediments deposited on the salt marsh. Results imply that distance from the Thames estuary, associated sewage sludge dumping areas in the Barrow Deep and the effects of the mass movement of water into the southern North Sea via the English Channel may determine the relative enhancement of organochlorines in sediments of the Essex salt marshes.

AB  - New data of aboveground biomass and production of four angiosperms over a 12 month period for the Cantabrian Sea salt marshes (Bay of Biscay, N. Spain) are presented. Based on harvest methods, maximum aboveground total biomass values for Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald, Spartina alterniflora Loisel, Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods and Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen were 628, 1109, 480 and 1267 gm-2, respectively. We conclude that although a slight latitudinal gradient in biomass is revealed in the data compiled with reference to some of the species studied, more work is necessary in order to assess the potential productivity of these ecosystems on the coasts of Europe and/or to make comparisons with salt marshes of the American coasts. Annual net aerial primary production estimates using Smalley's method were: 296, 1160, 486 and 952 gm-2 yr-1, for Spartina maritima, Spartina alterniflora, Salicornia ramosissima and Halimione portulacoides, respectively. These results together with turnover rate estimates point to the lack of vigour of the native S. maritima, while the exotic S. alterniflora, which seems to be spreading along the Cantabrian estuaries, behaves like a veritable pioneer throughout the low marshes in this region.

AB  - Physicochemical (organic matter content, relative humidity, humic acid content, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content) and microbiological activities (extracellular enzymatic activities, basal and substrate induced respiration and bioenergetical parameters) were evaluated in salt marsh degraded sediments, during a 1 year revegetation trial starting at the end of the growing season. For this revegetated with Halimione portulacoides and also in nearby sediments with savage H. portulacoides plants and bare sediments were monitored for comparison proposes. Sediments colonized by savage plants showed higher water content, organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous contents, in contrast with the low values observed in bare and colonized by transplants sediments. Overlooking the microbial metabolic and respiratory parameters it was observed that the more efficient microbial communities were present in the sediments colonized by the savage plants. Also the extracellular enzymes showed differences. In the transplant colonized sediments and also in the bare ones, peroxidase showed high and similar activities. By the contrary urease showed lower in these last sediments. Only acid phosphatase showed a different trend being higher in the bare sediments and in the sediments colonized by savage plants. Applying a rhizosphere sediment microbial index (RSMI) it was assessed that the more important factors for these sediments evaluation were the Basal respiration, urease activity, metabolic coefficient, total phosphorous content and total carbon content. Using this index for evaluation it showed riot only that the sediments colonized by savage plants presented microbial quality, but also it was shown that the bare sediments and the sediments colonized by the transplants after a 1 year period still have the same microbial characteristics and thereby similar microbial qualities. This allowed to conclude that over the duration of this experiment, the revegetated sediments were still far from reaching the quality levels of the sediments naturally colonized, indicating that the 1 year period of revegetation was not enough to a successful restoration of a degraded salt marsh. Although the restoration process was not successful, the elaboration of the RSMI proved to be useful with applications in future monitorization programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bedload and nearbed transport of coarse (>1 mm) detritus particles were investigated in a tidal creek of a salt marsh in the Westerschelde estuary (south-west Netherlands). Using a fyke net positioned on the creek bottom, hourly transport through the creek was measured during 14 flood-ebb cycles in 1990 and 1991. Transport was bidirectional with flood imports varying between 32 and 2601 g dry weight (DW), and ebb exports varying between 0 and 4737 g DW. In nine of 14 tidal cycles, the creek was functioning as a net exporting system. The material that was exported with the ebb consisted mainly of macrophyte material. The annual loss of coarse organic matter by bedload plus nearbed transport through the creek was estimated to be less than 0.2% of the estimated annual above-ground plant biomass production in the drainage area of the creek. Therefore, it is concluded that this type of detritus transport is probably insignificant for the carbon balance of the salt marsh. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Disturbance regimes are shifting in response to climate change, land-use change, species' invasions, and other stressors, challenging ecologists to improve understanding of the mechanisms controlling plant recovery under different conditions. In this study, we investigate mechanisms that underpin plant recolonization of two types of disturbance: disturbances that remove standing plant biomass, but leave the underlying soil structure largely intact, and those that remove standing biomass and physically disrupt soil structure. In the southeastern United States, salt marshes, drought and invasive feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are associated with disturbances of these respective types and both leave behind mudflats dotted with patches of cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), the system's dominant foundation species. To test how disturbance type and remnant patch size may interact to affect cordgrass recolonization, we transplanted replicate cordgrass patches of three sizes into one mudflat that experienced vegetation-only disturbance (VD) during a recent drought, and a second mudflat where hog activities had disrupted the soil structure creating a soil + vegetation disturbance (soil + VD). Over one year, we monitored plant performance and properties of soil. Compared with the drought-associated VD where patches, regardless of their size, expanded vigorously, large and medium patches grew little and smaller patches even less in the hog-associated soil + VD mudflat. Moreover while biogeochemical properties varied little in the VD compared with adjacent vegetated marsh areas, the mudflats with soil + VD had less soil-binding organic matter and, hence, were too soft to support crab burrows, leading to a reduction in oxygen availability and cordgrass expansion. These results indicate that cordgrass recovery is far faster from disturbances that do not degrade soil structure than those that do and therefore advocate for disturbance-specific management strategies. Specifically, while transplanting patches is effective in restoring marshes disturbed by drought, wrack, or other factors that leave soil structure intact, preventative measures, like hog population culling, are essential to mitigating the ecological impacts of soil structure-altering disturbances.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes store large amounts of carbon but the magnitude and patterns of greenhouse gas (GHG; i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) fluxes are unclear. Information about GHG fluxes from these ecosystems comes from studies of sediments or at the ecosystem-scale (eddy covariance) but fluxes from tidal creeks are unknown. We measured GHG concentrations in water, water quality, meteorological parameters, sediment CO2 efflux, ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes, and plant phenology; all at half-hour intervals over 1 year. Manual creek GHG flux measurements were used to calculate gas transfer velocity (k) and parameterize a model of water-to-atmosphere GHG fluxes. The creek was a source of GHGs to the atmosphere where tidal patterns controlled diel variability. Dissolved oxygen and wind speed were negatively correlated with creek CH4 efflux. Despite lacking a seasonal pattern, creek CO2 efflux was correlated with drivers such as turbidity across phenological phases. Overall, nighttime creek CO2 efflux (3.6 0.63 mu mol/m(2)/s) was at least 2 times higher than nighttime marsh sediment CO2 efflux (1.5 1.23 mu mol/m(2)/s). Creek CH4 efflux (17.5 6.9 nmol/m(2)/s) was 4 times lower than ecosystem-scale CH4 fluxes (68.1 52.3 nmol/m(2)/s) across the year. These results suggest that tidal creeks are potential hotspots for CO2 emissions and could contribute to lateral transport of CH4 to the coastal ocean due to supersaturation of CH4 (>6,000 mu mol/mol) in water. This study provides insights for modeling GHG efflux from tidal creeks and suggests that changes in tide stage overshadow water temperature in determining magnitudes of fluxes.
   Key Points
   A tidal creek was a hotspot for CO2 efflux compared to the surrounding wetland Changes in tide stage, not water temperature variability, regulated diel creek CO2 and CH4 efflux The relative influence of nontidal drivers of creek CO2 and CH4 efflux varied by plant phenological phases

AB  - Benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, oxygen, nutrients, nitrous oxide and methane were measured in situ at three sites of Rio San Pedro salt marsh tidal creek (Bay of Cadiz. SW Spain) during three seasons. This system is affected by the discharges of organic carbon and nutrients from the surrounding aquaculture installations. Sediment oxygen uptake rates and inorganic carbon fluxes ranged respectively from 16 to 79 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and from 48 to 146 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Benthic alkalinity fluxes were corrected for the influence of NH4+ and NO3-+NO2- fluxes, and the upper and lower limits for carbon oxidation rates were inferred by considering two possible scenarios: maximum and minimum contribution of CaCO3 dissolution to corrected alkalinity fluxes. Average C-ox. rates were in all cases within 25% of the upper and lower limits and ranged from 40 to 122 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Whereas carbon mineralization did not show significant differences among the sites, C-ox rates varied seasonally and were correlated with temperature (r2=0.72). During winter and spring denitrification was estimated to account for an average loss of 46% and 75%, respectively, of the potentially recyclable N, whereas during the summer no net removal was observed. A possible shift from denitrification to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) during this period is argued. Dissolved CH4 and N2O fluxes ranged from 5.7 to 47 mu mol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) and 4.3 to 49 mu mol N-N2O m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and represented in all cases a small fraction of total inorganic C and N flux. Overall, about 60% of the total particulate organic matter that is discharged into the creek by the main fish farm facility is estimated to degrade in the sediments, resulting in a significant input of nutrients to the system.

AB  - The role of the hydrological regime in the nutrients and zooplankton composition and dynamics has been analysed in five lagoons of La Pletera salt marshes (NE Iberian Peninsula) during a complete hydrological cycle (2002-2003). Two of the lagoons have their origin in the old river mouths while the other three were recently created in the framework of a Life Restoration project. This fact has also allowed us to study the effect of the lagoon age on nutrient and zooplankton composition and dynamics. The salt marsh hydrology is determined by a prolonged period of confinement without water inputs, irregularly interrupted by sudden water inputs due to flooding events (sea storms or intense rain-falls). While the dynamics of oxidized nitrogen compounds in the lagoons depends on the water inputs variability within each hydrological cycle, the internal load of phosphorus, total nitrogen and organic matter is related more to the cumulative mechanisms during the confinement periods. Accumulation processes may be easily related to lagoon age, since old lagoons have higher content of nutrients and organic matter, suggesting that these lagoons progressively accumulate nutrients during the successive confinement events. This is the usual case for most Mediterranean salt marshes without an artificially manipulated water regime. The zooplankton community in La Pletera integrates the effects of both the hydrological regime and the lagoon age since the former determines the temporal pattern of the main zooplankton species and the latter explains differences in composition and structure between old and new lagoons.

AB  - Integrating spatial heterogeneity into assessments of salt marsh biogeochemistry is becoming increasingly important because disturbances that reduce plant productivity and soil drainage may contribute to an expansion of shallow ponds. These permanently inundated and sometimes prominent landscape features can exist for decades, yet little is known about pond biogeochemistry or their role in marsh ecosystem functioning. We characterized three ponds in a temperate salt marsh (MA, USA) over alternating periods of tidal isolation and flushing, during summer and fall, by evaluating the composition of plant communities and organic matter pools and measuring surface water oxygen, temperature, and conductivity. The ponds were located in the high marsh and had similar depths, temperatures, and salinities. Despite this, they had different levels of suspended particulate, dissolved, and sediment organic matter and abundances of phytoplankton, macroalgae, and Ruppia maritima. Differences in plant communities were reflected in pond metabolism rates, which ranged from autotrophic to heterotrophic. Integrating ponds into landcover-based estimates of marsh metabolism resulted in slower rates of net production (-8.1 +/- 0.3 to -15.7 +/- 0.9%) and respiration (-2.9 +/- 0.5 to -10.0 +/- 0.4%), compared to rates based on emergent grasses alone. Seasonality had a greater effect on pond water chemistry, organic matter pools, and algal abundances than tidal connectivity. Alternating stretches of tidal isolation and flushing did not affect pond salinities or algal communities, suggesting that exchange between ponds and nearby creeks was limited. Overall, we found that ponds are heterogeneous habitats and future expansion could reduce landscape connectivity and the ability of marshes to capture and store carbon.

AB  - We examined the role of chronic low-level nutrient enrichment on the productivity of heterotrophic marsh bacteria via a marsh fertilization experiment in which we mimicked the conditions of widespread coastal eutrophication by enriching entire salt marshes to approximately 153 background nutrient concentrations. We measured the uptake of tritiated leucine, as a proxy for bacterial production, in both low and high marsh habitats in four salt marshes, two of which were enriched with nutrients. We hypothesized that adding nitrogen in these detritus-rich systems would directly stimulate bacterial decomposition of marsh peat. Contrary to our expectations, we found no response to added nutrients in high marsh habitats, where there is a significant supply of organic matter from marsh vegetation. Bacterial production did increase in the low marsh habitats, where fertilization increased the standing stock of benthic chlorophyll. Fertilization did not directly increase bacterial production by providing added nutrients that could be used to decompose organic matter derived from nutrient-poor marsh grasses. Rather, bacterial productivity was indirectly stimulated by the concomitant increase in labile benthic microalgae in low marsh habitats. Decomposition of salt marshes may therefore have a greater resilience to the threat of chronic eutrophication than has been previously recognized.

AB  - Seasonal variations in above- and belowground biomass were examined over the 1994 growing season (May to October) in the 3 major plant zones of a saltmarsh located on the Bay of Fundy. Standing crop of aboveground biomass was measured over the growing season. Belowground samples were processed at depth intervals of 2 cm, providing high-resolution vertical profiles to a depth of 40 cm. Spartina alterniflora showed evidence of the translocation of belowground biomass to aboveground tissue in the early part of the growing season, when the rate of aboveground growth is at a maximum. Shifts in S. alterniflora organic matter storage were most dynamic in the surface 16 cm. Biomass translocation generally was not significant in the S. patens stands, where the rate of aboveground growth was consistent throughout the growing season. All seasonal changes associated with Plantago maritima biomass seem to occur before July, since no changes in above- and belowground biomass were observed between July and October. P. maritima contributes the least to marsh soil organic matter.

AB  - The response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise is receiving global attention and observed changes in the distribution of mangrove and salt marsh are increasingly associated with global climate change, particularly sea-level and temperature rise, and potentially elevated carbon dioxide. Processes operating over smaller-spatial scales, such as rainfall variability and nutrient enrichment are also proposed as possible short-term drivers of changes in the distribution of mangrove and salt marsh. We consider the response of mangrove and salt marsh in a subtropical estuary to changes in environmental variables over a 12 year period by comparing rates of surface elevation change and vegetation distribution dynamics to hydrological and climatic variables, specifically water level and rainfall. This period of analysis captured inter-annual variability in sea level and rainfall associated with different phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We found that the mangrove and salt marsh trend of increasing elevation was primarily controlled by position within the tidal prism, in this case defined by inundation depth and distance to the tidal channel. Rainfall was not a primary driver of elevation trends in mangrove and salt marsh, but rainfall and water level variability did influence variability in elevation over the study period, though cross-correlation of these factors confounds identification of a single process driving this variability. These results highlight the scale-dependence of coastal wetland vegetation distribution dynamics; the longer-term trend of surface elevation increase and mangrove encroachment of salt marsh correlated with global sea-level trends, while short-term variability in surface elevation was related to local variability in water level and rainfall. Rates of surface elevation increase were found to lag behind rates of water level change within the Tweed River, which may facilitate further expansion of mangrove into salt marsh. This study advocates integration of ecological and geomorphic techniques to understand the response of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise and climatic perturbations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The below ground biomass of salt marsh species accounts for more than half of the total plant biomass in salt marsh systems, yet no biomass data exist for salt marsh species in South Africa. The aims of the current study were to compare the biomass allocation of Salicornia tegetaria in six estuaries and relate findings to their environmental conditions. The current study measured the physico-chemical variables of the sediment (moisture content, organic matter content, electrical conductivity, pH) and pore water (temperature, salinity, pH, depth) at Olifants, Berg, Langebaan, Heuningnes, Nahoon and Kwelerha estuaries. Above and below ground biomass and stem height measurements were also collected. The below ground biomass (1.51 +/- 0.24 kg m(-2)) and root/shoot ratio (1.36 +/- 0.17) was the lowest at Heuningnes Estuary with no significant difference at the remaining estuaries, suggesting that factors, such as geomorphology and sedimentological processes, could have a stronger effect on the biomass allocation in this species. Important drivers of biomass allocation were sediment pH, redox potential and pore water depth. The current study provides baseline information for S. tegetaria, an endemic salt marsh species, for which there is a paucity of data. This species plays a major role in the ecology of the lower intertidal zone, which will be vulnerable to sea-level rise.

AB  - A Holocene sea-level curve is constructed from the facies distribution and radiocarbon ages of sediment recovered from the distal, southern salt marsh of Langebaan Lagoon, on the southwest coast of South Africa. Calibrated radiocarbon analyses of an oyster-rich bioclastic gravel indicate that the Flandrian Transgression flooded the lagoon to 0-3 m above present-day levels by 6750 years ago (6.8 ka). Organic matter and shell material dated in distal lagoonal sediments indicate that sea level returned to present-day levels by 4.9 ka and have since remained within +/-1 m of present-day levels. Bleached shell and a hiatus in sedimentation suggest an approximate 1 m sea-level lowstand between 2.5 and 1.8 ka Changes in the macrobenthos assemblage since 1.5 ka that include the loss of the oyster Ostrea atherstonei, razor clam Solen capensis, brown mussel Arcuatula capensis and periwinkle Oxystele variegata reflect loss of hard substrate, decreased tidal-flow velocities as reworked sands prograded into the southern lagoon and possibly cooler sea-surface temperatures. Calibrated radiocarbon ages of bulk organic matter from diatom-rich, Zostera muddy quartzose sands indicate a 0.5 m sea-level highstand at 1.3 ka followed by a 0.5 m lowstand at 0.7 ka. Dating of fining-upward, organic-rich (2 wt % TOC) noncalcareous muds indicates that the present-day salt marsh has grown by aggradation (similar to1 mm y(-1)) and progradation since 0.7 ka.

AB  - Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) is recognized as a threat to wetland habitats throughout much of the western United States, but its role in tidal marshes has not been explored. Over three seasons in three regions of San Francisco Estuary (Suisun, San Pablo, and South San Francisco bays), we characterized locations in tidal marshes where monotypic stands of L. latifolium are replacing the native Sarcocornia pacifica (pickleweed). Soils within L. latifolium stands had significantly lower moisture, salinity, organic matter, and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) and higher pH than in adjacent S. pacifica stands at similar elevation and distance from channels. In addition, L. latifolium canopies were 2 to 3 times taller, thus increasing light reaching soils, and tended to support different insect/spider assemblages (sampled only at the Suisun site). Patterns were generally consistent across the three sites, although less pronounced for some measures at the South Bay site. Overall, these data suggest that L. latifolium invasion of tidal marshes is leading to modification of both structural and functional properties, several of which might further facilitate spread of the invader; however, additional study is needed to determine cause vs. effect for several soil characteristics.

AB  - Physical factors, such as local geomorphology and hydrology, are the primary determinants of biological pattern and process in a salt marsh. The increased topographic relief associated with the creekbank region is thought to control the unique chemistry and productivity found there. This study was designed to examine the role that tidal creeks play-during the natural development of a barrier island Spartina alterniflora marsh ecosystem on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA. A salt marsh chronosequence, resulting from a 1962 overwash event, was used as a 'space-for-time' substitution in order to define the changes that take place within this marsh over a successional time scale. The chronosequence of marshes is largely attributed to the variation in elevation across the overwash platform: younger marshes are higher relative to sea level. We used a principal components analysis on a suite of physico-chemical and biological variables. A single principle component explained 53% of the variability in the data and is used to describe the functional trajectory along which these marshes develop. This component is associated with an increase in sediment organic matter and nitrogen content (%N), porewater nutrients, S. alterniflora height, weight, %flowering and %N, and a decrease in grain size and redox potential. The factor scores from this analysis, which were used as a proxy for the functional maturity of the marsh, increased from creek edge to interior marsh for young marsh sites. Thus, the marsh nearest the creek most resembles the mature marsh. The temporal patterns of creek-water physico-chemistry vary between different aged creeks, suggesting that due to their small size and shallow depth younger creeks act to retain nutrients and particulates within the marsh. The hydrological, chemical and biological processes within the creeks themselves and at the creekbank are important in controlling the overall rate of marsh development. While creeks act to accelerate the rate of maturation, our results also indicate that not all marshes follow the same developmental trajectory and that the regional landscape may be a more important factor. With the increased interest in marsh restoration and creation for the mitigation of coastal wetland loss, there is a need for a greater functional understanding of the factors that control marsh development. The results of this study suggest that increasing creek frontage will increase the rate at which created marshes achieve functional equivalence with mature marshes.

AB  - Many salt marshes in densely populated areas have been subjected to a reduction in tidal flow. In order to assess the impact of tidal flow restriction on marsh sedimentation processes, sediment cores were collected from flow-restricted salt marshes along the Connecticut coast of Long Island Sound. Cores were also collected from unrestricted reference marshes and from a marsh that had been previously restricted but was restored to fuller tidal flushing in the 1970's. High bulk densities and low C and N concentrations were found at depth in the restricted marsh cores, which we attribute to a period of organic matter oxidation, sediment compaction, and marsh surface subsidence upon installation of flow restrictions (between 100 and 200 years before the present, depending on the marsh). Recent sedimentation rates at the restricted marshes (as determined by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) were positive and averaged 78% (Cs-137) and 50% (Pb-210) of reference marsh sedimentation rates. The accumulation of inorganic sediment was similar at the restricted and reference marshes, perhaps because of the seasonal operation of the tide gates, while organic sediment accretion (and pore space) was significantly lower in the restricted marshes, perhaps because of higher decomposition rates. Sedimentation rates at the restored marsh were significantly higher than at the reference marshes. This marsh has responded to the higher water levels resulting from restoration by a rapid increase in marsh surface elevation.

AB  - \ Constructed coastal marsh regulates land-born nitrogen (N) loadings through salinity-dependent microbial N transformation processes. A hypothesis that salinity predominantly controls N removal in marsh was tested through incubation in a closed system with added-(NH4+)-N-15 using sediments collected from five sub-marshes in Shihwa marsh, Korea. Time-course patterns of concentrations and N-15-atom% of soil-N pools were analyzed. Sediments having higher salinity and lower soil organic-C and acid-extractable organic-N exhibited slower rates of N mineralization and immobilization, nitrification, and denitrification. Rates of denitrification were not predicted well by sediment salinity but by its organic-C, indicating heterotrophic denitrification. Denitrification dominated N-loss from this marsh, and nitrogen removal capacity of this marsh was estimated at 337 kg N day(-1) (9.9% of the daily N-loadings) considering the current rooting depth of common reeds (1.0 m). We showed that sediment N removal decreases with increasing salinity and can increase with increasing organic-C for heterotrophic denitrification.

AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands exhibit high rates of carbon burial and storage in anaerobic sediments, but the extent to which carbon sequestration is offset by methane (CH4) emissions from these ecosystems remains unclear. In this study we combine measurements of sediment-air CH4 fluxes with monitoring of belowground CH4 pools in a New Jersey tidal marsh in order to clarify mechanistic links between environmental drivers, subsurface dynamics, and atmospheric emissions. Measurements were conducted in an unvegetated mud flat and adjacent low marsh vegetated with Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. Pore water measurements throughout the year revealed long-term CH4 storage in mud flat sediments, leading to a seasonal lag in emissions that extended into winter months. CH4 reservoirs and fluxes in vegetated sediments were well described by an empirical temperature-response model, while poor model agreement in unvegetated sediments was attributed to decouplings between production and flux due to storage processes. This study highlights the need to incorporate sediment gas exchange rates and pathways into biogeochemical process models.

AB  - The aim of this study was to understand if two species of salt marsh plants, widely distributed in European estuaries (Spartina maritima and Halimione portulacoides) differently influence the distribution, activity, and metabolic physiology of sediment bacterial communities in monospecific banks, in comparison with uncolonized sediment (control). Microbiological descriptors of abundance and activity were assessed along vertical profiles of sediments. Rates of activity of the extracellular enzymes beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase were generally higher in the vegetation banks in relation to control sediments where they were also less variable with depth. This is interpreted as an indirect effect related to supply of plant-derived polymeric substrates for bacterial growth. Parameters related to sediment texture (grain size, percent of fines or water content) showed significant relations with cell abundance or maximum hydrolysis rates, pointing to an indirect effect of plant colonization exerted through the modification of sediment physical properties. The profiles of utilization of sole-carbon-source (Biolog Ecoplates) showed that only the communities from the upper sediment layer of the S. maritima and the H. portulacoides banks exhibit consistent differences in terms of physiological profiles. Bacterial communities in control sediments exhibited the lowest physiological variability between surface and sub-surface communities. The results indicate that microbial colonization and organic matter decomposition are enhanced under the influence of salt marsh plants and confirm that plant coverage is a major determinant of the processes of organic matter recycling in intertidal estuarine sediments.

AB  - In support of efforts to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL), we investigated the utility of foraminifera, diatoms and bulk-sediment geochemistry (C-13, C:N and parameters measured by Rock-Eval pyrolysis) as sea-level indicators in Eurasian sub-Arctic salt marshes. At three salt marshes (<15km apart) in Dvina Bay (White Sea, Russia), we collected surface sediment samples along transects from subtidal to Taiga forest environments. Foraminifera at all sites formed bipartite assemblages, where elevations below mean high higher water (MHHW) were dominated by Miliammina spp. and elevations between MHHW and the highest occurrence of foraminifera were dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens. Five high-diversity groups of diatoms were identified and they displayed pronounced variability amongst the study sites. Bulk-sediment geochemistry recognized two groups (clastic-dominated environments below MHHW and organic-rich environments above MHHW). As one group included subtidal elevations and the other included supratidal elevations, we conclude that the measured geochemical parameters are not stand-alone sea-level indicators. Core JT2012 captured a regressive sediment succession of clastic, tidal-flat sediment overlain by salt-marsh organic silt and freshwater peat. The salt-marsh sediment accumulated at 2804 +/- 52years before present and preserved foraminifera (Jadammina macrescens and Balticammina pseudomacrescens) with good analogy to modern assemblages indicating that RSL was +2.60 +/- 0.47m at this time. Diatoms confirm that marine influence decreased through time, but the lack of analogy between modern and core assemblages limited their utility as sea-level indicators. Geochemical parameters also indicate a reduction in marine influence through time. We conclude that RSL reconstructions derived from salt-marsh sediment preserved beneath Eurasian sub-Arctic peatlands can provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of the Fennoscandian and Eurasian ice sheets.

AB  - Shallow ponds are expanding in many salt marshes with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning. Determining how pond characteristics change over time and scale with physical dimensions and other spatial predictors could facilitate incorporation of ponds into projections of ecosystem change. We evaluated scaling relationships across six differently sized ponds in three regions of the high marshes within the Plum Island Ecosystems-Long Term Ecological Research site (MA, USA). We further characterized diel fluctuations in surface water chemistry in two ponds to understand short-term processes that affect emergent properties (e.g., habitat suitability). Primary producers drove oxygen levels to supersaturation during the day, while nighttime respiration resulted in hypoxic to anoxic conditions. Diel swings in oxygen were mirrored by pH and resulted in successive shifts in redox-sensitive metabolisms, as indicated by nitrate consumption at dusk followed by peaks in ammonium and then sulfide overnight. Abundances of macroalgae and Ruppia maritima correlated with whole-pond oxygen metabolism rates, but not with surface area (SA), volume (V), or SA:V. Moreover, there were no clear patterns in primary producer abundances, surface water chemistry, or pond metabolism rates across marsh regions supplied by different tidal creeks or that differed in distance to upland borders or creekbanks. Comparisons with data from 2 years prior demonstrate that plant communities and biogeochemical processes are not in steady state. Factors contributing to variability between ponds and years are unclear but likely include infrequent tidal exchange. Temporal and spatial variability and the absence of scaling relationships complicate the integration of high marsh ponds into ecosystem biogeochemical models.

AB  - An 87-day simulation experiment was conducted to test the effects of water level fluctuation on soil properties of an inland salt marsh. The simulated wetland was periodically flooded for 15 days with consistent water levels of 10cm above the wetland surface soil and then drained to 0cm for 9 days. Soil samples were collected from the 0 to 30 cm depth with 10cm intervals at days of 0, 39 and 72 after a 15-day pre-incubation. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), soil organic matter (SOM) and pH were determined during the experimental period. Results showed that TN content was much higher in surface soils than other soil layers during the whole incubation period, especially at the second inundation period (54 days), and TN greatly increased in the soil layers above 20cm with increasing incubation time. However, the SOM content in each soil layer showed a consistent tendency of "decreasing followed increasing" with increasing incubation time. Compared to other soil layers, SOM content in surface soils were generally higher during the simulation periods. TP content in upper soils (0-20cm) consistently increased over the course of incubation time, while those in deeper soils (20-30cm) decreased. Soil pH values showed similar changing tendencies to SOM content over the incubation experiment, while they generally increased with depth. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this research, sediments from the Secovlje Salina (northern Adriatic, Slovenia) were geochemically investigated in order to decode the mobility of metal(oid)s in the hypersaline environment. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn were comparable to those detected in various similar coastal background areas, as well as in the Secovlje salt marsh core sample. The estimated mobility potential of metal(oid)s in sediment decreases in the following order: Mo > As > Cu > Sb > Sn > Co > Pb > Ni > Zn. Since the hypersaline sediment (e.g. healing mud) is used as a healing factor (it can be applied directly on human skin), the study of metal(oid) bioavailability in an interaction between the hypersaline sediments and the artificial sweat was also performed. It is significant that the metal(oid) contents are leached in very low concentrations and are treated as nontoxic for humans according to international norms for cosmetic products. The study provides information in order to assess the role of metal mobility on the potential health impact of the application of natural healing mud. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Experimental chambers were used in a Virginia salt marsh to partition the tidal flux of dissolved nutrients occurring at the marsh surface and in the water column. On five dates from June to October 1989, six replicate chambers in the short Spartina alterniflora zone were monitored over complete tidal cycles. When reservoir water, used to simulate tidal flooding in the chambers, was initially low in dissolved nutrients, the marsh surface was a source of both ammonium and phosphate to the water column. Calculations of the physical processes of diffusion and advection could not account for total nutrient release from the marsh surface. We hypothesize the primary source of nutrients was organic matter mineralization in surface sediments, which released nutrients into the flooding water column. Assimilation (uptake) of phosphate measured in water-column incubation experiments was nearly equal to phosphate released from the marsh surface. Surface release of ammonium, however, was somewhat greater than water-column uptake. In this salt marsh, benthic production and release of ammonium and phosphate is comparable in magnitude to pelagic consumption, thereby yielding only a small "net" transfer of these nutrients to the estuary.

AB  - Platinum is one of the least abundant elements in the earth crust with an average concentration of 0.51 ng g(-1), but its use in several human activities (mainly automobile catalytic converters) is leading its enrichment in surface sediments. Whereas, previous studies have assessed the Pt behavior in soils from urban areas, natural systems are still poorly studied.
   Accordingly, this study is aimed to characterize the behavior of the Pt released to coastal environments in sediments, ascertain the role of vegetation on the biogeochemistry of this element and assess the transference of Pt into the biological compartments. Several sediment cores were sampled in salt marshes (in unvegetated and vegetated areas) of the Tagus Estuary under different traffic pressure. Platinum concentration was analyzed in solid sediment, interstitial water and roots, leaves and stems of Sarcocomia fruticosa, a typical plant in south European salt marshes. In addition, interpretative parameters (e.g. redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, total reduced sulfur species, salinity and dissolved Fe and Mn in interstitial waters) were determined to better understand the biogeochemical cycle of Pt in salt marsh sediments.
   Although surface enrichment of Pt exists in the sediments at Low Traffic Station (2.8 ng g(-1)), the highest enrichment was found at High Traffic Station where concentration was, in some cases, up to 40 ng g(-1), linked to traffic emissions. However, dissolved Pt in interstitial waters (from 0.14 to 0.70 ng L-1) did not show this superficial maximum. This dissimilarity points out the unreactivity of traffic-borne Pt and the dissolution/precipitation cycle of natural Pt linked to Mn and O-2 cycle, depending on the redox conditions, highly controlled by the vegetation. Platinum concentration in roots (0.9 +/- 0.6 ng g(-1)) is reflecting the Pt concentration in the interstitial waters in each moment, even though at the two peaks of dissolved Pt (up to 2.5 ng L-1) found at deeper layers, reflecting a low bioaccumulation. However, results pointed that a different Pt species (with different bioavailability) may exist in both stations. Besides, Pt mean value in stems and leaves (0.04 +/- 0.05 ng g(-1)) indicates a low translocation of Pt from the roots to aerial parts.
   Therefore, the role of vegetation is fundamental on the geochemical behavior of Pt in sediments, due to the control of the redox conditions by roots in the surrounding sediments (between the O-2 release and the organic matter degradation) and leading to Pt species of varying bioavailability.

AB  - The effects of allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the growth and photosynthesis of Phaeodactylum tricornutum were investigated. P tricornutum incubated in f/2 medium was exposed to DOM additives, which were extracted from the plant and sediment samples of a salt marsh in North Branch of the Yangtze estuary, China. During 12 days incubation, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of P tricornutum were measured by a Phyto-PAM phytoplankton analyzer. Spectral properties of DOM in algae filtrates were also observed. The concentrations of chlorophyll a, active chlorophyll a, and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II significantly decreased after four days of incubation, suggesting that the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of P tricornutum were inhibited. After adding sediment-DOM extract, both a(250)/a(365) (the ratio of the absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm) and S values (spectral slope coefficients) of algae filtrates declined in the first two days, which demonstrated a loss of low molecular weight DOM. Parallel factor analysis of fluorescence spectra of DOM in algae filtrates revealed that DOM could be classified into two humic-like and two protein-like components. The fluorescence intensity of tyrosine-like component originating from algae increased significantly during incubation. This study supports the hypothesis that allochthonous DOM derived from salt marsh plant and sediment have a strong influence on the adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were measured in surface and porewaters as a function of depth and distance from the channel in a transect up the bank in a southern California salt marsh. Higher absorbance coefficients and fluorescence intensities in porewaters at depth vs. surface waters and shallower porewaters suggest soil porewater is a reservoir of CDOM in the marsh. Higher values were observed at the marsh sites compared to the channel site, suggesting increased production and storage in the marsh sites, and reduced leaching into overlying surface waters, is occurring. Spectral slope ratios decreased with depth, consistent with more aromatic, higher molecular weight material in the deeper porewaters, possibly due to different bacterial processing in the anaerobic vs. aerobic zones. Fe(II) concentrations, indicative of anaerobic bacterial processing, increased significantly at depth to values >1000M, consistent with active anaerobic microbial processing occurring at depth. The transitions to higher reduced iron concentrations correlated with increased absorbance and fluorescence, suggesting processing by anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria in these deeper zones may not mineralize as much carbon as in the shallower aerobic zones. Alternatively, this may be due to reduction of solid iron oxides coated with organic matter releasing both DOM and Fe(II). The ratio of humic-like fluorescence to the absorption coefficient decreased with increasing iron concentration, possibly due to optical interference by iron species. Taken together, the data indicate that marsh sites in the salt marsh act as a reservoir for higher molecular weight, more aromatic organic matter.

AB  - A transect of the St Marys River estuary from above the point of maximum salt wedge penetration to coastal salinities was conducted in July 1999. None of the parameters examined-dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content, UV light absorbance at 254 run, and Total Luminescence spectra-follow the rule of conservative mixing. The characteristics of the different molecular size fractions of the St Marys River natural organic matter (NOM), as well as the results of a laboratory mixing experiment, provided evidence that loss of larger molecular size compounds from riverine NOM may occur by coagulation at salinities up to 10. An apparent gain of carbon in the lower estuary was attributed to exports from abundant coastal marshes in this area.
   The Total Luminescence spectra of the riverine NOM can be described by two peaks, centered respectively around 340/445 nm, and 230/430 nm Excitation/Emission Wavelength Pair (EEWP), which are characteristic of humic materials of aquatic origin. The samples from the high salinity stations exhibit peaks at lower emission wavelength EEWP 320/424 rim, which can be considered as marine humic-like material. The presence of amino acid-tryptophan like peaks were observed, with EEWP 300/350 nm in some of the high salinity samples. This peak was of high relative fluorescence intensity. It is hypothesized that the intense biological activity of the salt marsh and near coastal area is responsible for the carbon addition as well as the appearance of the highly fluorescence amino acid-protein like material.

AB  - Southern California coastal wetlands are heavily impacted by urbanization and are under increased inundation stress due to sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the impacts of inundation on decomposition rates and sediment decomposer communities (invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria) by manipulating inundation using a marsh organ. Under increased inundation, invertebrate diversity decreased, and plant litter decomposition was reduced by excluding fungi and invertebrates from substrates using litter bags, indicating that all three decomposer guilds are important. This study showed significant impacts of increased inundation on bacterial, fungal and invertebrate community structure and diversity, yet only modest effects on sulfate reduction and decomposition rates, suggesting a degree of resilience or functional redundancy in the decomposer community. While the marsh organ successfully simulated increased inundation, it also created experimental 'bottle effects' that may have obscured inundation treatment effects and altered communities from the natural marsh. In our study, invertebrates were most sensitive to inundation, while bacteria appeared to be more resistant. This has implications for how decomposition and associated biogeochemical and ecological processes might change in the face of increased inundation due to SLR and suggests that marsh organs may be less suitable for investigating microbial communities compared with plants.

AB  - A growth experiment with native plants in pots exposed to natural environmental conditions evaluates the use of sewage sludge as a soil amendment in restoration of a southern California salt marsh. Sludge containing desirable organic matter but also undesirable heavy metal contaminants was mixed with a readily available matrix soil to reduce metal concentrations to levels below legal limits for land applications of sludge. Soil nutrient analysis revealed expected increases in total nitrogen and total phosphorus content with increasing sludge concentration. Soil metals analysis, however, revealed decreases in metal content with increased sludge concentration, a trend evidently caused by higher than expected metal content in the matrix soil. Five artificial soil mixtures ranging from 0 to 70% sludge were accompanied by natural wetland soil controls. Pots containing these soils were placed into a natural salt marsh. The pots were then planted with two native salt marsh plant species, Salicornia virginica and Frankenia grandifolia . Aboveground biomass was harvested after 12 months. Plant growth displayed no obvious change with increasing sludge concentration. Over the concentration ranges used, increased nutrient content did not stimulate plant growth and increased metal content did not inhibit plant growth. Plants grew better in natural wetland soil than in artificial soil mixtures, a trend probably caused by the substantially finer texture and higher organic content of natural soil. All sludge treatments differed more from the natural soil than from each other, implying that within the ranges examined, soil texture and organic content exerted more influence on plant growth than did metal or nutrient concentration. These results suggest that incorporating this sewage sludge in the soil of the restored salt marsh will neither benefit nor harm the plants that will live there and that greatest plant growth will be achieved by mixing the sludge with a fine-grained matrix soil.

AB  - Accelerating sea-level rise and human impacts to the coast (e.g., altered sediment supply and hydrology, nutrient loading) influence the accumulation of sediment and organic matter, and thereby impact the ability of coastal tidal wetlands to maintain an elevation consistently within the vegetation growth range. Critical components of marsh sustainability are the marsh elevation within the vegetation growth range (elevation capital) and the rates of marsh surface elevation change and relative sea-level rise. The relationship among these factors and their combined influence on marsh integrity were evaluated by comparing trends in surface elevation change on five salt marsh sites located on three marsh islands in Jamaica Bay, NY, USA. All marsh sites were located in a similar physical setting (i.e., tidal range, sea-level rise rate, sediment supply). The structural integrity of the marshes ranged from densely vegetated (high integrity) to severely deteriorated (low integrity) with elevation capital ranging from high to low, respectively, and included a deteriorating marsh site that was partially restored. Two marshes with high elevation capital maintained their relative position high within the tidal range through a combination of surface sediment deposition and shallow subsurface expansion, and kept pace with local sea-level rise. A marsh with moderate elevation capital showed signs of flooding stress and was deteriorating, but managed to keep pace with local sea-level rise. The deteriorated marsh gained no elevation over the 14-year study and was located too low within the tidal range to support continuous coverage of salt marsh vegetation. Elevation gain in the restored marsh initially lagged behind sea-level rise for 8years, but the elevation trend recovered and kept pace with sea-level rise for the last 5years. A conceptual model is presented that describes the relationship among elevation capital, and rates of marsh elevation gain and sea-level rise. Note that a search for factors influencing wetland loss should focus on process changes to marsh vertical development (e.g., sediment supply, vegetation growth) and climate change effects (e.g., sea-level and temperature rise) that can cause elevation gain to lag behind sea-level rise, and these occur prior to the onset of marsh deterioration.

AB  - Deltaic wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which characteristically can act as C-sinks. However, they are among the most threatened ecosystems, being very vulnerable to global change, and require special attention towards its conservation. Knowing their climate change mitigating potential, conservation measures should also be oriented with a climatic approach, to strengthen their regulatory services. In this work we studied the carbon biogeochemistry and the specific relevance of certain microbial guilds on carbon metabolisms of the three main types of deltaic wetlands located in the Ebro Delta, north-eastern Spain, as well as how they deal with human pressures and climate change effects. We estimated the metabolic rates of the main carbon-related metabolisms (primary production and respiration) and the resulting carbon and global warming potential balances in sites with a different salinity range and trophic status. With the results obtained, we tried to define the influence of possible changes in salinity and trophic level linked to the main impacts currently threatening deltaic wetlands, on the C-metabolisms and GHG emissions, for a better understanding of the mitigating capacity and their possible enhancement when applying specific management actions. Metabolic rates showed a pattern highly influenced by the salinity range and nutrients inputs. Freshwater and brackish wetlands, with higher nutrient inputs from agricultural runoff, showed higher C-capture capacity (around 220-250 g C m(-2) y(-1)), but also higher rates of degradative metabolisms (aerobic respiration and CH4 emissions). Contrastingly, the rates of C-related metabolisms and C-retention of Salicornia-type coastal salt marshes were lower (42 g C m(-2) y(-1)). The study of the microbial metacommunity composition by the 16S RNA gene sequencing revealed a significant higher presence of methanogens in the salt marsh, and also higher metabolic potential, where there was significantly more organic matter content in sediment. Salinity inhibition, however, explained the lower respiration rates, both aerobic and anaerobic, and prevented higher rates of methanogenesis despite the major presence of methanogens. Conservation measures for these wetlands would require, overall, maintaining the sediment contributions of the river basin intending to overcome the regression of the Delta and its salt marshes in a climate change scenario. Particularly, for reducing degradative metabolisms, and favour C-retention, nutrient inputs should be controlled in freshwater and brackish wetlands in order to reduce eutrophication. In salt marshes, the reduction of salinity should be avoided to control increases in methanogenesis and CH4 emissions.

AB  - Vegetation transitions occur globally, altering ecosystem processing of organic matter and changing rates of soil biogeochemical cycling. In coastal marshes, more salt- and inundation-tolerant herbaceous species are encroaching on less tolerant species, concomitant with sea level rise. These species shifts could disrupt ecosystem services such as soil organic matter storage and the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). To determine how these ecosystem processes were affected by encroachment, we characterized biogeochemical properties and functions along a transect of encroaching Distichlis spicata L. Greene (saltgrass) on Spartina bakeri Merr. (cordgrass), two herbaceous species. During both the wet and dry season, nine soil cores were obtained from three community types: saltgrass end member, transition zone, and cordgrass end member. Total soil C, N, and organic matter were greatest within the saltgrass and transition zones. The saltgrass and transition zone soils also supported higher rates of enzyme activity and potentially mineralizable N and P than cordgrass soils during the dry season, and greater potential CO2 production and microbial biomass C during the wet season. Generally, the transition zone functioned similarly to the saltgrass zone and the encroachment gradient coincided with a 33 cm elevation change. Seasonally, low extractable nutrient availability (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus) during the dry season was correlated with overall greater enzyme activity (N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, and cellobiosidase) and potentially mineralizable N and phosphorus (P) rates. This study demonstrates that shifts in dominant herbaceous species and accompanying abiotic gradients alters biogeochemical processing of organic matter within coastal marshes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several recent studies indicate that the replacement of extant species with Phragmites australis can alter the size of nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes within tidal marshes. Some common effects of P. australis expansion are increased standing stocks of N, greater differentiation of N concentrations between plant tissues (high N leaves and low N stems), and slower whole-plant decay rates than competing species (e.g., Spartina, Typha spp.). Some of the greater differences between marsh types involve R australis effects on extractable and porewater pools of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and N mineralization rates. Brackish and salt marshes show higher concentrations of DIN in porewater beneath Spartina spp. relative to R australis, but this is not observed in freshwater tidal marshes when P australis is compared with Typha spp. or mixed plant assemblages. With few studies of concurrent N fluxes, the net effect of P australis on marsh N budgets is difficult to quantify for single sites and even more so between sites. The magnitude and direction of impacts of R australis on N cycles appears to be system-specific, driven more by the system and species being invaded than by P australis itself. Where P. australis is found to affect N pools and fluxes, we suggest these alterations result from increased biomass (both aboveground and belowground) and increased allocation of that biomass to recalcitrant stems. Because N pools are commonly greater in P australis than in most other communities (due to plant and litter uptake), one of the most critical questions remaining is "From where is the extra N in R australis communities coming?" It is important to determine if the source of the new N is imported (e.g., anthropogenic) or internally produced (e.g., fixed, remineralized organic matter). In order to estimate net impacts of P australis on marsh N budgets, we suggest that further research be focused on the N source that supports high standing stocks of N in P australis biomass (external input versus internal cycling) and the relative rates of N loss from different marshes (burial versus subsurface flow versus denitrification).

AB  - The coastal zone of southern Patagonia, characterized by a macrotidal regime, allows the development of extensive salt marshes in estuaries and bays, which have been little studied. In order to characterize the marshes of the south of Santa Cruz, identify the main vegetal assemblages and analyze the variations of the vegetal biomass in relation to the tidal level and the time of the year, three samplings were carried out in spring (November 2015), summer (February 2016) and winter (August 2016) in San Julian Bay and the estuaries of the Santa Cruz, Coyle and Gallegos rivers. The samplings were performed using a stratified random design, dividing the salt marsh into three levels: high, middle and low. Six samples of 0.25 m(2) were collected at each level, and the percentage of coverage of each species and its aerial biomass (dry weight) was determined. Substrate grain size and organic matter content of the sediment (%) were also determined. The data were analyzed by factorial ANOVA (locality, level, and season of the year). The substrate in all localities and levels consisted mainly of silt-clays (54 to 88%) and fine sand (20 to 44%). Organic matter content varied between 4.5 and 7.1%. Five plant species were recorded: Sarcocornia perennis, Puccinellia glaucescens, Suaeda argentinensis, Limonium brasiliense and Spartina sp. S. perennis was the dominant species in almost all localities and levels, with the exception of the high and the middle saltmarsh of San Julian Bay, where it codominates with Limonium brasiliense, and the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, where it codominates together with Spartina sp. The total aerial vegetation biomass reached its maximum value (1700 g m(-2)) during the summer in the low marsh of the estuary of the Gallegos river; all the biomass corresponded to S. perennis. The lowest value of total biomass (177 g m(-2)) was recorded in the high marsh of San Julian Bay during the winter and corresponded in 33.8% to S. perennis. The coverage of S. perennis varied between 23 and 100%, being always higher in the low marsh. Spartina sp. was found only in the low marsh of the estuary of the Santa Cruz River, site that constitutes the southernmost record for this halophyte on the Argentina coast.

AB  - Biogenic structures produced by soil ecosystem engineers mediate soil functions and ecosystem services. Ant mounds are important biogenic structures in marsh wetlands, where they can occur at high densities. However, little information is available on their roles in the C and N cycling in these ecosystems. We measured CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from ant mounds of three different ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida) and estimated their contribution to the total gas emissions of soils from May to September 2010 in a Calamagrostis angustifolia-Carex schmidtii marsh wetland of the Sanjiang Plain, in northeastern China. Average CO2 emissions from ant mounds ranged from 0.84 to 1.95 g CO2 m(-2)h(-1) and were 1.08-3.09 times higher than from the surrounding marsh soils. Soil CO2 emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by mound type and sampling season. On the whole, average soil CO2 emissions from L niger mounds were lower in comparison to those from E candida mounds and L.flavus mounds. Ant mound soils were CH4 sinks (-0.39 similar to -0.19 mg m(-2) h(-1)) while the control marsh soils were CH4 emission sources (0.13-0.76 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Soil CH4 and N2O emissions did not significantly differ among the three different types of ant mounds. Compared with control marsh soils (0.034-0.045 mg m(-2) h(-1)), N2O emissions from ant mounds (0.007-0.13 mg m(-2)h(-1)) were influenced more by sampling season. Overall, ant mounds contributed measurable amounts to soil gas emissions from the wetland, averaging 7.02%, -4.28% and 335% of total soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emission, respectively. Ant mounds also increased the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil gas emissions in the marsh. Thus ant mounds may be important to a complete understanding of wetland ecosystem C and N cycles and balances. Research on more ant species from more ecosystems is needed to establish ant mound impacts on soil gas emissions at a global scale. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low nutrient availability in salt marsh ecosystems can potentially limit primary productivity and subsequent carbon export to coastal waters. In temperate marshes with low external nitrogen inputs, nitrogen (N(2)) fixation may enhance availability of usable nitrogen to marsh plant communities and increase their growth. The effects of sub-surface soil amendment of polysaccharides on rhizosphere N(2) fixation, and on plant growth and tissue characteristics of the California cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, were tested in microcosms in a tidal simulator. Polysaccharide was added as alginate extract, and rhizosphere N(2) fixation and plant characteristics were measured over 9 weeks. N(2) fixation rates increased 10-fold in the alginate treatment compared to controls after 1 week of exposure as a result of increased availability of a readily usable form of carbon. N(2) fixation rates in amended sediment were significantly higher than rates in control sediments at weeks 1 and 3. Although plant characteristics did not differ between treatments, trends of increased number of leaves and shoots in amended plants compared to controls appeared between weeks 7 and 9. The potential for increased plant growth following an increase in N(2) fixation rates warrants further investigation as it may have implications for recovery of N-limited disturbed and restored salt marshes.

AB  - We studied marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in a high marsh dominated salt marsh during the months of May to October in 2012-2014. Tidal inundation at the site occurred only during biweekly spring tides, during which we observed a reduction in fluxes during day and night. We estimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) using a modified PLIRTLE model, which requires photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as control variables. NDVI decreased during inundation, when the marsh canopy was submerged. Two-time series of NDVI, including and excluding effects of tidal inundation, allowed us to quantify the flux reduction during inundation. The effect of the flux reduction was small (2-4%) at our site, but is likely higher for marshes at a lower elevation. From May to October, GPP averaged -863 g C m(-2), R-eco averaged 591 g C m(-2), and NEE averaged -291 g C m(-2). In 2012, which was an exceptionally warm year, we observed an early start of net carbon uptake but higher respiration than in 2013 and 2014 due to higher-air temperature in August. This resulted in the lowest NEE during the study period (-255.96.9 g C m(-2)). The highest seasonal net uptake (-336.56.3 g C m(-2)) was observed in 2013, which was linked to higher rainfall and temperature in July. Mean sea level was very similar during all 3years which allowed us to isolate the importance of climatic factors.

AB  - The physical habitat of Juncus roemerianus was examined at nine sites along a salinity gradient in the Care Fear River Estuary, North Carolina. Soil salinity, drainage, redox potential, pH, elevation, percent sand, percent organic matter, and above-ground plant biomass and height were measured at each site, and from these data, the habitat of Juncus roemerianus was determined, All parameters varied over the salinity gradient, with soils at upriver sites having a high sand fraction, low organic fraction, and highest redox potentials, Downriver, well-established marshes had low sand fractions, high organic fractions, and lowest redox potentials, Canonical Discriminant Analysis indicated that each site was statistically different from other sites due to salinity, elevation, and percent organic matter.
   Mean standing live biomass was 688 g m(-2) and, despite differences in physical and chemical factors among sites, biomass of Juncus roemerianus did not vary, Juncus roemerianus was found to grow equally well within a broad range of physical and chemical habitats but did not occupy the total expanse of its potential habitat at any one site.
   Extensive overlap in physical habitat occurred between Juncus-dominated communities and adjacent communities dominated by other species, especially in the more established marshes. However, Canonical Discriminant Analysis statistically separated short and tall form Spartina alterniflora, Distichlis spicata, Scirpus robustus, and Juncus roemerianus microhabitats based on elevation and redox potential. Thus, we found zonation in tidal marshes of the Cape Fear River Estuary was based on abiotic factors, but we recognize the importance of plant species interactions and marsh position within the landscape.

AB  - Questions Coastal vegetated systems are known to play a fundamental role in climate change mitigation as a result of their efficiency sequestering and storing atmospheric CO2. While most of the work evaluating carbon sequestration capacity has focused on global change factors that can affect carbon release from plant litter decomposition through changes in (large-scale) environmental conditions, less is known about the possible effects of the loss (or replacement) of dominant species. We hypothesized that dominant marsh plants can influence decomposition not only through changes in litter quality but also through changes in (microscale) soil environmental conditions such as humidity, soil temperature or solar radiation. Location We performed a field manipulative experiment in a southwestern (SW) Atlantic salt marsh in Argentina. Methods We simulate a selective disturbance (i.e., removal of the dominant grass speciesSpartina densiflora) thus allowing removal plots to develop an alternative plant community. To evaluate the effect of the dominant grass species on litter decomposition, in an experiment we performed a litterbag approach three years after the establishment of the removal plots. Results Results showed that the presence ofS. densiflorasignificantly decreased litter decomposition directly by producing less labile litter, but also by effects that seem to be related to its structure as standing dominant vegetation. The experimental removal ofS. densifloraled to an alternative plant community, formed by otherwise subordinate species, which is less densely packed, allowing higher radiation incidence on the soil and elevated midday soil temperature. Conclusions Our results suggest that salt marsh litter decomposition, and thus C sequestration, is determined in part by the identity of the dominant plant, not only because of the quality of the produced litter but also as a consequence of the vegetation structure . Changes in species diversity, above all changes in the dominant species in these coastal systems, could have large impacts on the carbon turnover and mitigation capacity of these ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes are valuable but vulnerable coastal ecosystems that adapt to relative sea level rise (RSLR) by accumulating organic matter and inorganic sediment. The natural limit of these processes defines a threshold rate of RSLR beyond which marshes drown, resulting in ponding and conversion to open waters. We develop a simplified formulation for sediment transport across marshes to show that pond formation leads to runaway marsh fragmentation, a process characterized by a self-similar hierarchy of pond sizes with power-law distributions. We find the threshold for marsh fragmentation scales primarily with tidal range and that sediment supply is only relevant where tides are sufficient to transport sediment to the marsh interior. Thus the RSLR threshold is controlled by organic accretion in microtidal marshes regardless of the suspended sediment concentration at the marsh edge. This explains the observed fragmentation of microtidal marshes and suggests a tipping point for widespread marsh loss.

AB  - Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.

AB  - As ecosystem engineers, ants can mediate soil processes and functions by producing biogenic structures. In their mounds, ants not only directly produce CO2 by respiration, but may also indirectly impact soil greenhouse gas emissions by affecting substrate availability and soil physicochemical characteristics. Recent studies focused on overall gas production from ant mounds. However, little is known about mound material respiration and N2O emissions in ant mounds in wetlands. We measured CO2 and N2O emissions from mound soils of three different ant species (Lasius niger Linnaeus, Lasius flavus Fabricius, and Formica candida Smith) and natural marsh soils in a laboratory incubation experiment. On the whole, average soil CO2 and N2O emission rates from ant mounds were significantly higher than from the natural marsh soils. Over the 64 days incubation, the cumulative soil CO2 and N2O production from ant mounds was, respectively, 1.5-3.0 and 1.9-50.2 times higher than from the natural soils. Soil gas emissions from ant mounds were significantly influenced by the specific ant species, with soil CO2 and N2O emissions from L. niger mounds being higher than those from F. candida or L. flavus mound soils. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions from ant mound soils were positively correlated with soil clay, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen and NH4+ content. Our laboratory results indicated that mound soil is an important source of CO2 and N2O emission from ant mounds in marshes, making mounds potential "hot spots" for CO2 and N2O emissions. Ants may increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil gas emissions by changing mound soil physicochemical properties, especially carbon and nutrition content, and soil texture. Contributions from ant mound materials should be considered when describing soil C and N cycles and their driving factors in wetland ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt marshes constitute an important terrestrial-aquatic interface that remains underrepresented in Earth System Models due to constraining biophysical controls and spatially limited land cover. One promising approach to improve representativeness is the application of proximal remote sensing to generate phenological information, yet we lack detailed knowledge on how proximal sensors and indices perform within these ecosystems. We use measurements of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from eddy covariance (EC) and derive ecologically-relevant phenology parameters (i.e., phenoperiods) to use as carbon phenology benchmarks. These benchmarks are compared against vegetation indices and spectral bands derived from spaceborne (i.e., MODIS) or common proximal sensors (i.e., phenocam and spectral reflectance sensors; SRS).
   Phenocam derived indices, which exclude infrared wavelengths (i.e., vegetation contrast index; VCI and greenness chromatic coordinate; GCC), aligned closely with NEP benchmarks and provided best predictions of carbon sink season length (within 1-6 days of benchmark). Although isolating infrared from vegetation (NIRv) offered improvements, other indices utilizing infrared bands (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index; NDVI and enhanced vegetation index; EVI) primarily underestimated season start dates (5-30 days prior to benchmark) while overestimating season end dates (7-47 days after benchmark). These discrepancies are greatest for indices derived from MODIS and SRS sensors, which have narrower full width half maximum spectral bandwidths and sharper orientation angles. The phenocam (VCI and GCC) provides the most accurate phenology parameters while offering near-infrared (NIR) response which can generate additional information on seasonal changes in canopy structure and function.
   The distinctive characteristics of the salt marsh environment and vegetation properties including standing dead biomass can introduce interpretation challenges for commonly used vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI). Incorporating information from proximal sensors utilizing only visible wavelengths (VCI, GCC) or isolating the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) offers improvements for studying carbon phenology within salt marshes.

AB  - Structure of the invertebrate community of the salt marshes of the Bay of Somme (eastern English Channel). Biocoenotics and comparative studies, between grazed and not grazed salt marshes (schorre), have been carried out in the Bay of Somme. Four sampling technics have been used (vacuum, berlese extraction, core sampling and reaping) and have shown a biodiversity of 96 species. They are mostly composed of continental species (91 species). Arthropods (92 species) show dominant densities for Acarina (41,1 %) and Collembola (29,7 %). The specific richness and densities of 21 taxonomic groups remain weak by comparison with those observed in the same ecosystems in North sea, English Channel or Atlantic. However we found a lot of typical species of salt marshes: Amphipoda Talitridae, Coleoptera Carabidae and Trechidae, Araneida Lycosidae. The distribution of species, studied by a multivariate analysis (AFC) may be explained by the influence of the gradient "Sea - Continent" associated to the hydric statement and the substrate which differentiate several types of habitat. The large numbers of sea walls which have been built successively since the last century and the perturbations they induced in the environment, have contributed to slow down and disturb the installation of the fauna.
   The grazing of ovine or bovine herds seems to favor globally a greatest specific and numeric richness, as well as the diversity of components of the food web in the occupied areas, probably by the important enrichment in organic matter (faeces). Comparative and statistical analyses of these structural parameters showed significant differences between the populations of the two sites, not grazed and grazed, and confirmed also the stability of the last zone.

AB  - The phenolic oxidation products of lignin and neutral monosaccharides and amino acids released by acid hydrolysis were determined for samples of living and dead Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.), surficial marsh sediment, and the fulvic and humic acids isolated from these source materials, which were collected in a Georgia salt marsh estuary. Humic acids from all sources showed marked similarities in all of the parameters measured and closely resembled the source materials. Fulvic acid, while similar as a group, differed significantly from both the humic acids and the source material. Fungal decomposition of the plants, which is dominant to bacterial decomposition while the plants remain standing in the marsh, selectively degrades polysaccharides rather than indiscriminantly decomposing both lignin and polysaccharide biopolymers. The measured phenols, monosaccharides and amino acids accounted for 50-70% of the total carbon in the fulvic acids and 19-37% of the carbon in humic acids. Amino acids were estimated to account for 35-60% of fulvic acid nitrogen and 15-35% of humic acid nitrogen. There was no evidence that physiological state of the plants altered the intrinsic organic structure of either the fulvic or humic acids.

AB  - Soils from four sites distributed along an elevation gradient from marsh to coastal forest in a wetland bordering the Gulf of Mexico were sampled over a 16-months period. In addition to measuring a suite of environmental conditions, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of the resident bacterial communities were performed. Wetland soil bacterial communities varied across both space and time, with all measured variables (temperature, pH, percentage of soil organic matter, salinity, and concentrations of sulfide, NH4+, NO3-, and soluble reactive phosphorus) showing significant site by time interactions. Analyses of bacterial communities showed both marsh zones (Spartina and Cladium) supported similar communities, as did the ecotone and coastal forest. Bacterial communities within coastal forest soils were significantly different than those within marsh soils, and the ecotone communities were significantly different from the Spartina marsh soil. Temperature and pH were the most influential environmental factors impacting bacterial community composition but no predictable patterns were identified, suggesting that community changes are likely the result of intrinsic factors that are affected by local-scale processes. The dynamic nature of the physiochemical variables within wetlands suggests that more work is needed to determine potential interactive effects on bacterial community structure.

AB  - Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.

AB  - Hydrology is a major driver of salt marsh functions and the ecological services they support. Sediment saturation, and thus subsurface hydrology, affects salt marsh vegetation productivity, zonation, and survival. Subsurface hydrology influences rates of subsidence; concentrations of nutrients, organic matter, and oxygen; fluxes of the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide; and sediment toxicity. Therefore, baseline knowledge of subsurface hydrology is crucial in predicting and managing change in salt marshes. Previous research on subsurface hydrology has mostly been conducted in organogenic, microtidal marshes that do not provide suitable models for minerogenic, macrotidal marshes such as those in the Bay of Fundy. In this study, we examine drivers of subsurface hydrology and compare two pairs of reference and recovering marshes with tidal amplitudes of 6 to 12 m. Measurements in PVC wells at various depths reveal differences between seasons, during the neap-spring tidal cycle, and between channels of differing depths. We suggest that soil characteristics, duration between inundation events, marsh geomorphology, and precipitation all are more important drivers of subsurface hydrology in Bay of Fundy marshes than tidal height. Our observations also indicate that subsurface hydrology generally can be restored to previously drained marshes. Bay of Fundy marshes are likely to be more ecologically resistant to rising sea level because changes in tidal heights will have a minimal effect on subsurface hydrology. Thus, restoration of the many Bay of Fundy marshes previously drained for agriculture is likely to be successful in offsetting losses expected in more vulnerable, microtidal marshes.

AB  - Approximately 40,500 ha of Spartina-dominated marshes died during a drought-induced disturbance in Louisiana. This caused concern because in the absence of recovery, dieback marshes call subside. increasing the present high rates of wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. We assessed the recovery of one such dieback area after hydraulically dredged sediment-slurries were applied to the site to compensate for post-dieback soil consolidation. Five treatment-levels resulted from the sediment-slurry addition: 1) high elevation 2) medium elevation. 3) low elevation, 4) pop-up, and 5) vegetated. Plant recruitment within the five sediment treatment-levels were compared to two types of reference marshes: 1) ambient marshes. which neither died-back nor received sediment-enrichment, and 2) dieback marshes, which did not receive sediment addition. High and medium elevations had minimal recovery two years following the slurry addition. similar to that in reference dieback marshes. The low elevation, pop-up (highly organic sections of the original substrate that detached during slurry application and settled oil top of the sediment-slurry). and vegetated (dieback areas that recovered by the start of the Study) treatment-levels, all of which received sediment-slurry application, had rapid plant recovery. Plant recolonization,vas governed by optimal inundation, high organic matter content at high elevation, and. rhizome survivability following sediment burial. If applied appropriately, sediment-slurry amendments call restore Salt Marshes submerging due to subsidence or other events, like sea-level rise, that may result in excessive plant submergence,

AB  - Foliar release of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from live shoots of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.) was investigated in a Georgia (USA) salt marsh. Average foliar SRP release rates varied from undetectable to 7.5 mug P (g dry wt)-1 h-1 with values from individual plants as high as 61.7 mug P (g dry wt)-1 h-1. Release rates of SRP generally exhibited little diel variation and were highest in midsummer. Estimates of extrafoliar SRP accumulated on leaf surfaces varied from < 1 to 41 mug P (g dry wt leaf)-1 and 0.8 to 1.7 Mg p m-2 normalized to marsh area. Time course experiments revealed that SRP release was a 2-step process with a rapid solubilization of extrafoliar SRP and a constant release thereafter. Releases of SRP from creekbank stands of S. alterniflora during tidal submergence were estimated to be 3.1 to 8.2 Mg p M-2 d-1, with annual releases of 1.7 g P m-2 yr-1. Foliar releases of SRP from the live plants are equivalent to 60 % of the annual production of particulate phosphorus as S. alterniflora detritus reported from Georgia salt marshes.

AB  - Salt marshes dominated by saline seepweed (Suaeda heteroptera) provide important ecosystem services such as sequestering carbon (blue carbon), maintaining healthy fisheries, and protecting shorelines. These salt marshes also constitute stunning red beach landscapes, and the resulting tourism significantly contributes to the local economy. However, land use change and degradation have led to a substantial loss of the red beach area. It remains unclear how human activities influence the top-down and bottom-up forces that regulate the distribution and succession of these salt marshes and lead to the degradation of the red beaches. We examined how bottom-up forces influenced the germination, emergence, and colonization of saline seepweed with field measurements and a laboratory experiment. We also examined whether top-down forces affected the red beach distribution by conducting a field survey for crab burrows and density, laboratory feeding trials, and waterbird investigations. The higher sediment accretion rate induced by human activities limited the establishment of new red beaches. The construction of tourism facilities and the frequent presence of tourists reduced the density of waterbirds, which in turn increased the density of crabs, intensifying the top-down forces such as predators and herbivores that drive the degradation of the coastal red beaches. Our results show that sediment accretion and plant-herbivory changes induced by human activities were likely the two primary ecological processes leading to the degradation of the red beaches. Human activities significantly shaped the abundance and distribution of the red beaches by altering both top-down and bottom-up ecological processes. Our findings can help us better understand the dynamics of salt marshes and have implications for the management and restoration of coastal wetlands.

AB  - The biogeochemistry at the rhizosphere of salt marsh plants only recently has started being thoroughly investigated. Knowledge on the subject is relevant to realize the potentialities of those plants for rhizoremediation (biological remediation that takes advantage of the synergy between vegetation and rhizosphere microorganisms). Roots and microorganisms living in the root zone and growing on the root exudates, can act as an independent subsystem in the sediment, which is called the rhizosphere. The concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, organic matter and speciation and concentration of trace chemical species are different at the rhizosphere and surrounding sediment and condition the pH and redox potential.
   In the ambit of a project on this topic, targeting different salt marsh plants (Halimione portulacoides, Juncus maritimus and Scirpus maritimus) which colonize estuarine sediments in Cavado, Douro and Sado Portuguese Rivers, the role vegetation plays on distribution and remediation of trace metals, organochlorine pesticides and butyltin compounds has been surveyed. Studies in situ, ex situ and in vitro have been carried out. Attention has been also paid to the influence on the biological response of plants, of metal complexing exudates and possible synergistic or antagonistic effects of different pollutants concomitantly present at the rhizosphere. A summary of the results obtained so far by our research team is presented in this chapter.

AB  - Salt marsh resilience to sea-level rise depends on marsh plain elevation, tidal range, subsurface processes, as well as surface accretion, of which suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) is a critical component. However, spatial and temporal patterns of inorganic sedimentation are poorly quantified within and across Salicornia pacifica (pickleweed)dominated marshes. We compared vertical accretion rates and re-examined previously published suspended-sediment patterns during dry-weather periods at Seal Beach Wetlands, which is characterized by a mix of Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) and pickleweed, and for Mugu Lagoon, where cordgrass is rare. Mugu Lagoon occurs higher in the tidal frame and receives terrigenous sediment from an adjacent creek. Feldspar marker horizons were established in winter 2013-2014 to measure accretion. Accretion rates at Seal Beach Wetlands and Mugu Lagoon were 6 +/- 0.5 mm/year (mean +/- SE) and 2 +/- 0.3 mm/year. Also, the estimated sediment flux (g/year) across the random feldspar plots was 3.5 times higher at Seal Beach Wetlands. At Mugu Lagoon, accretion was higher near creeks, although not statistically significant. Dry-weather SSC showed similar concentrations at transect locations across sites. During wet weather, however, SSC at Mugu Lagoon increased at all locations, with concentrations decaying farther than 8 m from tidal creek edge. Based on these results from Mugu Lagoon, we conclude accretion patterns are set by infrequent large flooding events in systems where there is a watershed sediment source. Higher accretion rates at Seal Beach Wetlands may be linked to lower-marsh elevations, and thus more frequent inundation, compared with Mugu Lagoon.

AB  - Coastal climate adaptation strategies are needed to build salt marsh resiliency and maintain critical ecosystem services in response to impacts caused by climate change. Although resident microbial communities perform crucial biogeochemical cycles for salt marsh functioning, their response to restoration practices is still understudied. One promising restoration strategy is the placement of sand or sediment onto the marsh platform to increase marsh resiliency. A previous study examined the above- and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in Spartina alterniflora-vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments at varying inundation regimes. Here, we analyzed samples from the same experiment to test the effect of sand-amendments on the microbial communities after 5 months. Along with the previously observed changes in biogeochemistry, sand amendments drastically modified the bacterial communities, decreasing richness and diversity. The dominant sulfur-cycling bacterial community found in natural sediments was replaced by one dominated by iron oxidizers and aerobic heterotrophs, the abundance of which correlated with higher CO2-flux. In particular, the relative abundance of iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria increased in the sand-amended sediments, possibly contributing to acidification by the formation of iron oxyhydroxides. Our data suggest that the bacterial community structure can equilibrate if the inundation regime is maintained within the optimal range for S. alterniflora. While long-term effects of changes in bacterial community on the growth of S. alterniflora are not clear, our results suggest that analyzing the microbial community composition could be a useful tool to monitor climate adaptation and restoration efforts.

AB  - The influence of organic C quantity and quality on denitrification in riparian environments is poorly understood. We measured denitrification potential (DNP), organic matter, and several fractions of organic C in surface soils and subsurface sediments in a river riparian zone. Surface soils in conifer forest peat, mixed forest, and marsh sites had similar DNP, although mean organic matter ranged from 9.4% (marsh) to 19.6% (mixed forest) and 36.6% (peat). These soils also differed widely in organic C, water-extractable C, and anaerobic mineralizable C. Mean DNP in peat at depths of 0.8 to 1.4 m was four times lower than in the surface peat. Mean organic matter and organic C were significantly greater in the deep peat than at the surface, whereas the other C fractions were similar. Mean organic matter content of buried channel sediments at depths of 2 to 3 m was 3.6%; however, mean DNP was 75 to 80 times lower than in the surface mixed forest and marsh soils. When the three surface soil sites were considered separately, anaerobic mineralizable C showed the highest correlation with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.87) and the conifer peat soil (r = 0.82). Water-extractable C was also highly correlated with DNP in the marsh soils (r = 0.81). Correlations between DNP and either organic matter or the three C fractions were not significant in the deep peat, whereas the former channel sediments showed a significant relationship between DNP and both organic matter (r = 0.81) and water-extractable C (r = 0.81). These results show that C quantity and quality influence DNP, but no single index was a good predictor for all soil types.

AB  - Soils (n = 250) were collected from ten salt and brackish-water marshes of North Carolina and analyzed for organic matter content by loss on ignition (LOI) and Kjeldahl nitrogen (KN). Total organic carbon and total nitrogen were determined on the same samples using an elemental CHN analyzer. Regression analyses indicated that LOI and KN were excellent estimators of organic C (R2 = 0.990) and total N (R2 = 0.986), respectively, in low clay content (0-11%) marsh soils containing a wide range of soil organic C (0.1-28%) and total N (0-1.6%). A quadratic equation best described the relationship between organic C and organic matter (Organic C = 0.40 [LOI] + 0.0025 [LOI]2) while a linear model accurately described the relationship between total N and Kjeldahl N (Total N = 1.048 [KN] - 0.010). The proportion of organic C in organic matter (C/OM) increased with increasing soil organic matter content, probably as a result of aging. Young marshes, which are characterized by low soil organic content contain C/OM ratios similar to emergent vegetation (40-45%). In old organic soils (70-80% organic matter), C/OM increased to 57-60% due to accumulation of reduced organic materials.

AB  - Wetland stores substantial amount of carbon and may contribute greatly to global climate change debate. However, few researches have focused on the effects of global climate change on carbon mineralization in Zoig alpine wetland, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the most important peatlands in China. Through incubation experiment, this paper studied the effects of temperature, soil moisture, soil type (marsh soil and peat soil) and their interactions on CO2 and CH4 emission rates in Zoig alpine wetland. Results show that when the temperature rises from 5A degrees C to 35A degrees C, CO2 emission rates increase by 3.3-3.7 times and 2.4-2.6 times under non-inundation treatment, and by 2.2-2.3 times and 4.1-4.3 times under inundation treatment in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively. Compared with non-inundation treatment, CO2 emission rates decrease by 6%-44%, 20%-60% in marsh soil and peat soil, respectively, under inundation treatment. CO2 emission rate is significantly affected by the combined effects of the temperature and soil type (p < 0.001), and soil moisture and soil type (p < 0.001), and CH4 emission rate was significantly affected by the interaction of the temperature and soil moisture (p < 0.001). Q (10) values for CO2 emission rate are higher at the range of 5A degrees C-25A degrees C than 25A degrees C-35A degrees C, indicating that carbon mineralization is more sensitive at low temperature in Zoig alpine wetland.

AB  - Soil net N-mineralization rate was measured along a successional gradient in salt-marsh sites that were grazed by vertebrate herbivores, and in 5-year-old exclosures from which the animals were excluded. Mineralization rate was significantly higher at ungrazed than at grazed sites. In the absence of grazing, mineralization rate increased over the course of succession, whereas it remained relatively low when sites were grazed. The largest differences in mineralization rate between grazed and ungrazed sites were found at late successional stages where grazing pressure was lowest. The amount of plant litter was significantly lower at grazed sites. In addition, the amount of litter and potential litter (non-woody, live shoots) was linearly related to net N-mineralization rate. This implies that herbivores reduced mineralization rate by preventing litter accumulation. Bulk density was higher at grazed salt-marsh sites than at ungrazed sites. This factor may also have contributed to the differences in net N-mineralization rate between grazed and ungrazed sites.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contains organic acid charge groups that contribute organic alkalinity (OrgAlk) to total alkalinity (TA). These effects are often ignored or treated as a calculation uncertainty in many aquatic CO2 studies. This study evaluated OrgAlk variability, sources, and characteristics in estuarine waters exchanged tidally with a groundwater-influenced salt marsh in the northeast USA. OrgAlk provided a biogeochemical link between organic and inorganic carbon cycling through its direct effects on pH, and thus CO2 system speciation and buffer capacity. Two main charge groups were identified including carboxylic and phenolic or amine groups. Terrestrial groundwater and in-situ production within salt marsh peat contributed OrgAlk to the tidal creek, with the former being a more significant source. Groundwater entering the marsh complex contained exceptionally high OrgAlk (> 150 mu mol kg(-1)), and these compounds were preferentially preserved within the DOC pool during groundwater transport and mixing with coastal water. OrgAlk:DOC ratios in groundwater and marshinfluenced water varied across space and time. This highlights the insufficiency of using a fixed proportion of DOC to account for organic acid charge groups. Accounting for OrgAlk altered H+ concentrations by similar to 1-41 nmol kg(-1)(equivalent to a pH change of similar to 0.03-0.26), pCO(2) by similar to 30-1600 mu atm and buffer capacity by similar to 0.00-0.14 mmol kg(-1) at the relative OrgAlk contributions of 0.9-4.3% of TA observed in the marsh-influenced tidal water. Thus, OrgAlk may have a significant influence on coastal inorganic carbon cycling. Further theoretical calculations confirm that these concentrations of OrgAlk would have sizable impacts on both carbonate speciation and, ultimately, air-sea CO2 fluxes in different coastal environments, ranging from estuarine to shelf waters. A new conceptual model linking organic and inorganic carbon cycling for coastal waters is proposed to highlight the sources and sinks of organic acid charge groups, as well as their biogeochemical behaviors and mechanistic control on the CO2 system.

AB  - In salt-marshes, bulk carbon isotope values reflect organic matter contributions not only from salt-marsh plants, but also from algal and bacterial inputs, as well as allochthonous terrestrial organic matter. In the present study, compound specific isotope analysis was applied to a core and modern plant samples collected from a Machiasport, Maine salt-marsh. We sampled 10 plant species common to the marsh including Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, Juncus gerardi, Solidago sempervirens, Salicornia europa, Potentilla anserina, Atriplex patula, Plantago maritima, Suaeda maritima and Limonium nashii. Isolation of two n-alkanes (C-27 and C-29) present in marsh plant samples allowed for the reconstruction of past plant communities present in the cored deposits. For the C-27 and C-29 homologues there is a 3-10 parts per thousand separation in carbon isotopic composition between C3 and C4 species. Carbon isotopic values down core show a transition from a C4 dominated plant community to a C3 dominated community, attributable to the migration of lower marsh zones onto brackish/freshwater marsh zones during a late Holocene relative sea-level rise. The two homologues used have the potential to provide paleoenvironmental information in future core work, where the sea-level variable will be controlled. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impacts of coastal reclamation on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sinks of coastal wetlands remain unclearly understood. This study was conducted to investigate the alterations of soil organic C and N (SOC and SON) pools following conversion of Phragmites australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields and town construction land through reclamation along Jiangsu coast in eastern China. Coastal reclamation significantly increased stocks of soil total, labile and recalcitrant organic C and N (SLOC, SLON, SROC, and SRON), and concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C and N (SMBC and SMBN), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC) following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into fishpond, wheat and rapeseed fields. However, coastal reclamation reduced SOC, SLOC, SROC, SRON, WSOC, SMBC, SMBN, and MINC following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into town construction land. Our results suggest that coastal reclamation affects C and N sinks of coastal wetlands by changing SOC and SON pools size, stability and dynamics changes following conversion of P. australis salt marsh into other land use types. This finding were primarily attributed to alterations in quantity and quality of exogenous materials returning the soil, and soil physiochemical properties as affected by coastal reclamation.

AB  - Habitat reconstruction is commonly employed to restore degraded estuarine habitats and lost ecological functions. In this study, we use a combination of stable isotope analyses and macrofauna community analysis to compare the ecological structure and function between a recently constructed Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and a natural reference habitat over a 2-year period. The restored marsh was successful in providing habitat for economically and ecologically important macrofauna taxa; supporting similar or greater density, biomass, and species richness to the natural reference during all but one sampling period. Stable isotope analyses revealed that communities from the natural and the restored marshes relied on a similar diversity of food resources and that decapods had similar trophic levels. However, some generalist consumers (Palaemonetes spp. and Penaeus aztecus) were more C-13-enriched in the natural marsh, indicating a greater use of macrophyte derived organic matter relative to restored marsh counterparts. This difference was attributed to the higher quantities of macrophyte detritus and organic carbon in natural marsh sediments. Reduced marsh flooding frequency was associated with a reduction in macrofaunal biomass and decapod trophic levels. The restored marsh edge occurred at lower elevations than natural marsh edge, apparently due to reduced fetch and wind-wave exposure provided by the protective berm structures. The lower elevation of the restored marsh edge mitigated negative impacts in sampling periods with low tidal elevations that affected the natural marsh. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering sediment characteristics and elevation in salt marsh constructions.

AB  - To evaluate the seasonal and spatial variations of methane (CH4) emissions and understand the controlling factors, we measured CH4 fluxes and their environmental variables for the first time by a static chamber technique in high Suaeda salsa marsh (HSM), middle S. salsa marsh (MSM), low S. salsa marsh (LSM) and bare flat (BF) in the northern Yellow River estuary throughout a year.
   CH4 emissions from coastal marsh varied throughout different times of the day and significant differences were observed in some sampling periods (p < 0.05). Over all sampling periods, CH4 fluxes averaged between -0.392 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and 0.495 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), and emissions occurred during spring (0.008 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.068 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed during summer (-0.110 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (-0.009 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). CH4 fluxes from the four marshes were not significantly different (p > 0.05), and emissions occurred in LSM (0.026 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and BF (0.055 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) while sinks were observed in HSM (-0.035 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)) and MSM (-0.022 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average CH4 flux from the intertidal zone was 0.002 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), indicating that coastal marsh acted as a weak CH4 source. Temporal variations of CH4 emission were related to the interactions of abiotic factors (temperatures, soil moisture and salinity) and the variations of limited C and mineral N in sediments, while spatial variations were mainly affected by the vegetation composition at spatial scale.
   This study observed a large spatial variation of CH4 fluxes across the coastal marsh of the Yellow River estuary (CV = 7856.25 %), suggesting that the need to increase the spatial replicates at fine scales before the regional CH4 budget was evaluated precisely. With increasing exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary, the magnitude of CH4 emission might be enhanced, which should also be paid more attentions as the annual CH4 inventory was assessed accurately.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the soil properties and their modifications within the rhizosphere of spontaneous vegetation as key factors to assess the phytomanagement of a salt marsh polluted by mining wastes. A field survey was performed based on a plot sampling design. The results provided by the analyses of rhizospheric soil (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon, total nitrogen, etc.) and metal(loid)s' phytoavailability (assessed by EDTA) were discussed and related to plant metal uptake. The averages of pH and EC values of the bulk soil and rhizospheric samples were in the range of neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7-8) to saline (> 2 dS m(-1)), respectively. Heavy metal and As concentrations (e.g. similar to 600 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 50 mg kg(-1) Cd, similar to 11,000 mg kg(-1) Pb) were higher in the rhizosphere for both total and EDTA-extractable fraction. Phragmites australis uptaked the highest concentrations in roots (e.g. similar to 66 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 1,770 mg kg(-1) Zn) but not in shoots, for which most of plant species showed low values for Zn (< 300 mg kg(-1)) but not for Cd (> 0.5 mg kg(-1)) or Pb (similar to 20-40 mg kg(-1)). Vegetation distribution in the studied salt marsh looked to be more affected by salinity than by metal pollution. The free availability of water for plants and the incoming nutrient-enriched effluents which flow through the salt marsh may have hindered the metal(loid)s' phytotoxicity. The phytomanagement of these polluted areas employing the spontaneous vegetation is a good option in order to improve the ecological indicators and to prevent the transport of pollutants to nearby areas.

AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems constitute very productive habitats, characterized by efficient C-org sequestration and long-term preservation in sediments, so they play an important role in climate change mitigation. The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby. Our results highlight the need to protect these environments as relevant carbon reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal communities increasingly invest in natural and nature-based features (e.g., living shorelines) as a strategy to protect shorelines and enhance coastal resilience. Tidal marshes are a common component of these strategies because of their capacity to reduce wave energy and storm surge impacts. Performance metrics of restoration success for living shorelines tend to focus on how the physical structure of the created marsh enhances shoreline protection via proper elevation and marsh plant presence. These metrics do not fully evaluate the level of marsh ecosystem development. In particular, the presence of key marsh bivalve species can indicate the capability of the marsh to provide non-protective services of value, such as water quality improvement and habitat provision. We observed an unexpected low to no abundance of the filter-feeding ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, in living shoreline marshes throughout Chesapeake Bay. In salt marsh ecosystems along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, ribbed mussels improve water quality, enhance nutrient removal, stabilize the marsh, and facilitate long-term sustainability of the habitat. Through comparative field surveys and experiments within a chronosequence of 13 living shorelines spanning 2-16 years since construction, we examined three factors we hypothesized may influence recruitment of ribbed mussels to living shoreline marshes: (1) larval access to suitable marsh habitat, (2) sediment quality of low marsh (i.e., potential mussel habitat), and (3) availability of high-quality refuge habitat. Our findings suggest that at most sites larval mussels are able to access and settle on living shoreline created marshes behind rock sill structures, but that most recruits are likely not surviving. Sediment organic matter (OM) and plant density were correlated with mussel abundance, and sediment OM increased with marsh age, suggesting that living shoreline design (e.g., sand fill, planting grids) and lags in ecosystem development (sediment properties) are reducing the survival of the young recruits. We offer potential modifications to living shoreline design and implementation practices that may facilitate self-sustaining ribbed mussel populations in these restored habitats.

AB  - The stable isotope compositions (C, N, and S) of live, senescent, and standing dead Spartina alterniflora were compared in order to determine the effects of aerial decomposition on the isotopic signature of aboveground S. alterniflora tissue entering the food chain. Aerial decomposition of aboveground S. alterniflora resulted in a 6 to 18 parts per thousand increase in delta(34)S and a 2 to 3 parts per thousand decrease in delta(15)N values; delta(13)C values were unchanged. We describe mechanisms whereby the activity of fungi and epiphytic microorganisms may contribute to the observed shifts in delta(34)S and delta(15)N, respectively. The delta(13)C value of salt marsh benthic and epiphytic microalgae ranged from -13.0 parts per thousand in summer to -17.6 parts per thousand in early spring. Average delta(15)N values of microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora were -0.3 and 1.7 parts per thousand, respectively, reflecting the activity of N-2-fixing microorganisms. The delta(15)N values for omnivorous and herbivorous salt marsh macrofauna ranged between 7.5 and 2.2 parts per thousand, and for predatory Fundulus spp. delta(15)N averaged 9.2 parts per thousand. Given a presumptive +3 parts per thousand trophic shift in N assimilation, these results suggest that N-2-fixing microorganisms associated with microalgal communities were an important source of N to salt marsh consumers. The delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S values of primary producers were compared to the values of the following consumers: Fundulus spp., Uca spp., Illyanassa obsoleta, and Littoraria irrorata. delta(13)C VS delta(15)N and delta(13)C vs delta(34)S dual isotope plots demonstrated that microalgae and standing dead S. alterniflora are important food resources in the North Carolina (USA) marshes we sampled. In addition, a compilation of literature values suggests that this is true in salt marshes throughout the East and Gulf coasts of North America. Future isotope studies of marsh food webs should include detrital Spartina spp. material in analyses of trophic structure.

AB  - Already heavily impacted by coastal development, estuarine vegetated habitats (seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves) are increasingly affected by climate change via accelerated sea level rise, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation and storms, and warmer ocean temperatures. Conservation of these sensitive and vulnerable habitats requires the recognition of climate change effects so environmental managers can develop and apply appropriate intervention and adaptation strategies where possible. Here we focus on Spartina patens (saltmeadow cordgrass), a foundation species of New England (USA) coastal marshes. A growing, body of evidence suggests this species is disappearing rapidly from wetlands in the region, leading to reductions in habitat quality, plant diversity, carbon sequestration, erosion resistance and coastal protection. We grew S. patens under five inundation and three precipitation regimes, monitored changes in its extent within two Southern New England coastal marshes (2000-2014), and used water level and precipitation data to detect changes in environmental conditions affecting these marshes. Our results suggest that current inundation patterns have reduced the persistence of S. patens, while short-term drought did not appear responsible for vegetation changes or habitat conversion. We conclude that accelerated sea level rise is incompatible with the long-term survival of S. patens within the current landscape footprint of Southern New England's coastal wetlands. We suggest that conservation actions focused on high marsh preservation concentrate on facilitating the process of marsh migration onto uplands by prioritizing buffer conservation, conducting barrier removal and allowing for retreat where feasible.

AB  - We examined the sediment profiles, surface accretion rates, and soil carbon (C) accumulation rates of two brackish tidal marshes on Kilbella and Wannock Rivers of the central coast of British Columbia, Canada, a region where such tidal marsh studies are rare. Sediment grain size is variable within these deposits and is a significant predictor of soil C density. The average soil C density of the Kilbella (0.027 +/- 0.01 g C cm(-)(3)) and the Wannock marsh (0.029 +/- 0.007 g C cm(-)(3)) are within the range of reported global averages. Compared to global estimates, the depth weighted mean rates of soil C accumulation are low, between 29 and 50 g C m(-2) year(-1), although high sectional rates (up to 490 +/- 230 g C m(-)(3) year(-1)) occur in deeper segments of the marsh profile at Kilbella. Modern accretion rates are below moderate to high sea level rise scenarios. The Kilbella marsh contains sand layers from periods of mass sedimentation events (landslides and tsunamis), which provide the marsh with elevation capital that can be critical to its sustainability. The Kilbella profile demonstrates that variation in carbon density with depth cannot be predicted in marshes on geomorphologically dynamic coasts.

KW  - SOIL
AB  - Salt marshes are the major areas for net sedimentation in many estuaries such as the Delaware Bay, and their diagenetic chemistry is harsh and extreme with large seasonal excursions in chlorinity (1-50 ppt), pH (4-6), and Eh (-240 + 120). Such diagenesis is driven by organic matter decomposition using redox cycles of S and Fe materials imported primarily as tidal sea water SO4 and Fe silicates, respectively.
   Important and quantitative changes in clay mineralogy occur within a decade at the redox boundary in a high marsh sediment near Lewes, Delaware. The clay mineralogy consists initially of a micaceous illite and chlorite mixture accumulating at the salt marsh surface. It is comprised of relic glacial sediments deposited on the continental slope during their net tidal movement from the sea to land. Once buried, these detrital clays are transformed into a new assemblage containing an illite/smectitic mixed layer mineral of poor crystallinity. Using curve decomposition techniques on complex X-ray traces, it is estimated that this new phase constitutes 45-55% of the clay fraction.
   The redox boundary where the sharp transition occurs is only about 20 a old as determined by Pb-210 and Cs-137 geochronology, and, thus, the clay mineral transformation is rapid. The occurrence of the new, abundant clay mineral is very abrupt (less than 1 cm at 12 cm in depth) and, thus, may itself occur in as little as three years. Once formed, the new mixed layer phase remains stable during the subsequent 40 a of burial from the time of formation at the oxic/anoxic boundary.
   Slow transformations of unstable primary clay reactants such as illite and chlorite are a common process of soil formation. However such rapid clay reactions have rarely been documented in either subaerial or submerged soil settings. The formation of a smectite mineral product of high chemical reactivity for a significant portion of the clays in a soil is unusual. In fact, the abrupt change in clay mineralogy in the salt marsh occurs precisely at the sharp evolution in salt marsh geochemistry from oxidized to reducing conditions where there is extensive redox cycling of Fe and S phases. A large seasonal oscillation in interstitial pH and Eh probably contributes to the rapid clay transformation. Such clay transformations may have important implications for the retention of other trace elements entering the salt marsh by atmospheric fallout and tidal cycles, or the release of such metal inventories after burial.

AB  - The organic carbon consumed by aquatic bacteria (BCC) is partitioned between bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), but the factors that determine BCC and its partition into BP and BR are not well understood. We explored the coupling between BR, BR and BCC, and their links to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient availability in natural and restored tidal marshes and in the adjoining waters of Delaware Bay estuary. Labile DOC (LDOC) ranged from 3% to 22% of the DOC pool, and explained more of the variance in both BR and BCC than did bulk DOC. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable (0.090.58), and natural Spartina alterniflora marshes had consistently higher BGE than both restoration marshes and tidal floodwaters. BGE was negatively related to the ratio of LDOC to total dissolved phosphorous, which was highest in natural marshes. The enhancement of BP observed in the marshes relative to the estuarine floodwaters had different origins: In natural marshes it was mostly due to increases in BGE, whereas in restored marshes it followed increased BCC. These results highlight the importance of P in regulating microbial metabolism in coastal areas, and the need to understand the pathways that lead to BP in these systems.

AB  - There is a growing interest in including blue carbon ecosystems (i.e., mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) in climate mitigation programs in national and sub-national policies, with restoration and conservation of these ecosystems identified as potential activities to increase carbon accumulation through time. However, there is still a gap on the spatial scales needed to produce carbon offsets comparable with terrestrial or agricultural ecosystems. Here, we used the Coastal Blue Carbon InVEST 3.7.0 model to estimate future net carbon sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems along Australia's Great Barrier Reef (hereafter GBR) catchments, considering different management scenarios (i.e., reintroduction of tidal exchange through the removal of barriers, sea level rise, restoring low lying land) at three different spatial scales: whole GBR coastline, regional (14,000-16,300 ha), and local (335-370 ha) scales. The focus of the restoration (i.e., tidal marshes and/or mangroves) was dependent on data availability for each scenario. Furthermore, we also estimated the monetary value of carbon sequestration under each management scenario and spatial scale assessed in the study. We found that large scale restoration of tidal marshes could potentially sequester an additional similar to 800,000 tonnes of CO(2)e by 2045 (potentially generating AU$12 million based on the average Australia carbon price), with greater opportunities when sea level rise is accounted for in the modelling. Also, we found that regional and local projects would generate up to 23 tonnes CO(2)e ha(-1) by the end of the crediting period. Our results can guide future decisions in the blue carbon market and financing schemes, however, the return on investment is dependent on the carbon price and funding scheme available for project implementation.

AB  - For the time period 1974-1993, fluxes were estimated of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) brought to the salt marshes of Georgia and South Carolina by eight rivers, which drain approximately 75% of the upland watersheds of these estuaries. During this period, concentrations of DOC and DON averaged 5-28 mg C l(-1) and 0.35-0.75 mg N l(-1), respectively. The DON represented 40-90% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in the rivers during that period. River inputs to the marsh estuaries averaged 32.4 +/- 8.8 thousand tonne yr(-1) for DOC and 27.8 +/- 10.0 hundred tonne yr(-1) for DON. These inputs represent approximately 0.6 and 0.15%, respectively, of the DOC and DON estimated to be produced in situ in the salt marshes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salinity changes resulting from storm surge, tides, precipitation, and stormwater run-off are common in coastal wetlands. Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO2 flux) at high and low tide, CH4 flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (> 97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO2 flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO2 flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH4 (+) and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.

AB  - The East Anglian salt marsh system (UK) has recently generated intriguing data with respect to sediment biogeochemistry. Neighbouring ponds in these salt marshes show two distinct regimes of redox cycling: the sediments are either iron-rich and bioturbated, or they are sulphide-rich and unbioturbated. No conclusive explanation has yet been given for this remarkable spatial co-occurrence. Here, we quantify the geochemical cycling in both pond types, using pore-water analyses and solid-phase speciation. Our results demonstrate that differences in solid-phase carbon and iron inputs are likely small between pond types, and so these cannot act as the direct driver of the observed redox dichotomy. Instead, our results suggest that the presence of bioturbation plays a key role in the transition from sulphur-dominated to iron-dominated sediments. The presence of burrowing fauna in marine sediments stimulates the mineralisation of organic matter, increases the iron cycling and limits the build-up of free sulphide. Overall, we propose that the observed dichotomy in pond geochemistry is due to alternative stable states, which result from non-linear interactions in the sedimentary iron and sulphur cycles that are amplified by bioturbation. This way, small differences in solid phase input can result in very different regimes of redox cycling due to positive feedbacks. This non-linearity in the iron and sulphur cycling could be an inherent feature of marine sediments, and hence, alternative stable states could be present in other systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A five-step sequential extraction technique was used to determine the partitioning of Cr, Mn, Fe, CLI, Zn, Cd. and Pb among the operative sedimentary phases (exchangeable ions, carbonates, manganese and iron oxides, sulfides and organic matter, and residual minerals) in coastal sediment from three locations in the southwest Iberian Peninsula. Two sites are located close to industrial areas. the salt marshes of the Odiel River and Bay of Cadiz, and one in a nonindustrial area, the Barbate River salt marshes. The Odiel River salt marshes also receive the drainage from mining activities in the Huelva region. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn were extracted from the residual fraction at percentages higher than 60%. In the sediments from the Odiel River salt marshes, concentrations of all the metals, except Cu, Zn, and Cd, exceeded 60% in the residual fraction as well. In the sediments from the Bay of Cadiz and Barbate River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Mn and Cd: in those from the Odiel River salt marshes, the main bioavailable metals were Zn and Cd, respectively. The environmental risk was determined by employing the environmental risk factor (ERF), defined as ERF = (CSQV - Ci/CSQV), where Ci is the heavy metal concentration in the first four fractions and CSQV is concentration sediment quality value (the highest concentration with no associated biological effect). Our results showed that the sediments from the Cadiz Bay and Barbate River salt marshes do not constitute any environmental risk under the Current natural conditions. In contrast, in the Odiel River salt marshes. Cu. Zn. and Pb yielded ERFs of less than zero at several sampling stations and, consequently, pose a potential threat for the organisms in the area. This is a consequence of the high levels of metals in the area derived from the mining activity (pyrite) and industrial activities and the association of these heavy metals with more labile fractions of the sediments.

AB  - To understand the behavior of trace metals in the salt marsh at Skallingen, Danish Wadden Sea, we investigated a profile from surface to 25 cm depth of the salt marsh sediment, focusing primarily on clay mineralogy and grain size distribution of the sediments and their relationship with trace metals. The clay assembly of the sediment consists of illite, kaolinite and much less chlorite and smectite. The major clay minerals of illite, kaolinite as well as chlorite correlate very poorly with all the trace metals investigated, due probably to the weak competing strength of these clays compared with the other adsorbents and to low availability of the mobile trace metals in the system. Correlation between trace metals and clay minerals may therefore be used as an indicator in environmental assessment. Fine grain fractions of the sediment increased markedly after salt marsh invasion in about 1931 but decreased after 1964. This increase was contributed mainly by the grains finer than 20 mu m while the fraction of 40-63 mu m actually decreased soon after the invasion. The relation between most of the trace metals and grain size distributions is close in general but far from linear. The drastic turning point is observed at about 30 mu m, around where the correlation coefficient r drops from 0.8 to 0.1. Adsorption is the controlling mechanism for the behavior of trace metals in the salt marsh. Fe/Mn (hydr)oxides and organic matter play the key role.

AB  - Global change processes affect seasonal dynamics of salt marshes and thereby their plant and animal communities. However, these changes have been little investigated for microarthropod communities. We studied the effect of seasonality and changes in sea level on oribatid mites in the natural salt marsh and on artificial islands in the back-barrier environment of the island Spiekeroog (Wadden Sea, Germany). Three zones of the artificial islands were filled with transplanted sods from the lower salt marsh zone and thereby exposed to three different inundation frequencies. We hypothesized that oribatid mite communities will differ along the natural salt marsh vegetation zones [ upper salt marsh (USM), lower salt marsh (LSM), pioneer zone (PZ)], which are influenced by different tidal regimes. Accordingly, total oribatid mite densities declined from the USM and LSM to the PZ. Similarly, oribatid mite species compositions changed along the salt marsh transect and also responded to variations in inundation frequency in LSM on artificial islands with typical species of the USM, LSM and PZ being Multioppia neglecta (USM), Hermannia pulchella (LSM), Zachvatkinibates quadrivertex (LSM, PZ) and Ameronothrus schneideri (LSM, PZ). Oribatid mite density in the salt marsh and on the artificial islands was at a maximum in winter and spring; this was due in part to high density of juveniles, pointing to two reproductive periods. We hypothesized that oribatid mite trophic structure changes due to variations in abiotic (e.g., tidal dynamics, temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., resource availability). Stable isotope (N-15, C-13) and neutral lipid fatty acid analyses indicated that oribatid mite species have different diets with e.g., Z. quadrivertex feeding on macroalgae and fungi, A. schneideri feeding on microalgae and bacteria, and Scheloribates laevigatus and M. neglecta feeding on dead organic matter, bacteria and fungi. Overall, the results indicate that oribatid mite species in salt marshes are affected by changes in environmental factors such as inundation intensity, with the effects being most pronounced in species with narrow trophic niches and limited niche plasticity. The results also indicate that oribatid mite communities of the LSM respond little to short-term (one year) changes in inundation frequency.

AB  - The role of litter decomposition on organic matter accumulation and nutrient cycling was studied in a floodplain marsh of the Lower Parana River by means of in situ litterbag experiments. The effect of waterborne nutrients on decomposition rates was studied through a laboratory litterbag experiment. Litter decomposition was rather slow remaining 40-50% of the initial mass after 2 years incubation. Similar decomposition rates were observed in laboratory and field experiments. Water fertilization did not significantly affect decomposition rates. Since organic matter production is faster than decomposition a net accumulation takes place in the upper layers of the marsh soil. N and P litter concentration increased during the decomposition experiment. Floodplain marshes represent effective sinks of nutrients through litter accumulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The intertidal zone of estuarine wetlands is characterised by a transition from a saline marine environment to a freshwater environment with increasing distance from tidal streams. An experimental site has been established in an area of mangrove and salt marsh wetland in the Hunter River estuary, Australia, to characterise and provide data for a model of intertidal zone hydrology. The experimental site is designed to monitor water fluxes at a small scale (36 m). A weather station and groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and hydraulic head and tidal levels are monitored over a 10-week period along a short one-dimensional transect covering the transition between the tidal and freshwater systems. Soil properties have been determined in the laboratory and the field. A two-dimensional finite element model of the site was developed using SEEP/W to analyse saturated and unsaturated pore water movement. Modification of the water retention function to model crab hole macropores was found necessary to reproduce the observed aquifer response. Groundwater response to tidal fluctuations was observed to be almost uniform beyond the intertidal zone, due to the presence of highly permeable subsurface sediments below the less permeable surface sediments. Over the 36 m transect, tidal forcing was found to generate incoming fluxes in the order of 0.22 m(3)/day per metre width of creek bank during dry periods, partially balanced by evaporative fluxes of about 0.13 m(3)/day per metre width. During heavy rainfall periods, rainfall fluxes were about 0.61 m(3)/day per metre width, dominating the water balance. Evapotranspiration rates were greater for the salt marsh dominated intertidal zone than the non-tidal zone. Hypersalinity and salt encrustation observed show that evapotranspiration fluxes are very important during non-rainfall periods and are believed to significantly influence salt concentration both in the surface soil matrix and the underlying aquifer.

AB  - Salt marshes can be a significant source of MeHg in coastal marine organisms, however the sources and cycling of Hg in salt marsh sediments, and in coastal environments in general, remain unclear. We analyzed surface and cored sediments from a salt marsh and adjacent upland sand dune in Cabretta Island, Georgia, USA, for total mercury (Hg-T), Hg isotopes and trace metal concentrations to better constrain the sources of Hg in this coastal environment. Hg-T concentrations are lower in the upland sands (1-6 ng/g) than in the marsh sediments (6-16 ng/g). Hg-T shows a positive correlation with total organic content (TOC) and increasing proportion of fines in the sediments. Trace metal concentrations also show a positive correlation with Hg-T in the marsh sediments regardless of chemical affinity (i.e. chalcophile, siderophile or lithophile). All these data are consistent with surface adsorption (either directly on to sediments or on to organic matter) as a dominant mechanism of Hg and metals accumulation in the marsh sediments. The surface sediments show significant mass independent fractionation (MIF) of odd Hg isotopes: the upland dune sands have zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199 (-0.07 parts per thousand to -0.14 parts per thousand) and the marsh surface sediments have positive Delta Hg-199 (0.48 parts per thousand to 0.79 parts per thousand). As in the surface samples, well-sorted sand layers in the cored sediments have low Hg concentrations and zero to slightly negative Delta Hg-199, whereas fine particle-rich layers have higher Hg concentrations and positive Delta Hg-199 values. In the absence of any evidence for MIF of Hg isotopes by bacteria mediated methylation-demethylation reactions, the observed Hg isotope differences between marsh and upland sands can be explained by different sources of Hg. We suggest that local atmospheric Hg deposition dominates the Hg budget in the ombrotrophic upland sand, while the positive MIF in the marsh sediments are consistent with Hg dominantly of seawater origin. While in situ processes, like photoreduction and evasion can overprint the Hg depositional isotope signature, their effect on the sediments is currently unconstrained. Nevertheless, our data show that Hg isotopes can delineate different sources of Hg in a pristine coastal environment and at small spatial scales. Thus natural background isotope variability should be assessed as a baseline when Hg isotopes are used as tracers of Hg in anthropogenically-influenced sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effect of plant invasion on the microorganisms of soil sediments is very important for estuary ecology. The community structures of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) as a function of Spartina alterniflora invasion in Phragmites australis-vegetated sediments of the Dongtan wetland in the Yangtze River estuary, China, were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) and dissimilatory sulfite-reductase (dsrB) genes. Sediment samples were collected from two replicate locations, and each location included three sampling stands each covered by monocultures of P. australis, S. alterniflora and both plants (transition stands), respectively. qPCR analysis revealed higher copy numbers of mcrA genes in sediments from S. alterniflora stands than P. australis stands (5- and 7.5-fold more in the spring and summer, respectively), which is consistent with the higher methane flux rates measured in the S. alterniflora stands (up to 8.01 +/- 5.61 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Similar trends were observed for SRB, and they were up to two orders of magnitude higher than the methanogens. Diversity indices indicated a lower diversity of methanogens in the S. alterniflora stands than the P. australis stands. In contrast, insignificant variations were observed in the diversity of SRB with the invasion. Although Methanomicrobiales and Methanococcales, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens, dominated in the salt marsh, Methanomicrobiales displayed a slight increase with the invasion and growth of S. alterniflora, whereas the later responded differently. Methanosarcina, the metabolically diverse methanogens, did not vary with the invasion of, but Methanosaeta, the exclusive acetate utilizers, appeared to increase with S. alterniflora invasion. In SRB, sequences closely related to the families Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae dominated in the salt marsh, although they displayed minimal changes with the S. alterniflora invasion. Approximately 11.3 +/- 5.1% of the dsrB gene sequences formed a novel cluster that was reduced upon the invasion. The results showed that in the sediments of tidal salt marsh where S. alterniflora displaced P. australis, the abundances of methanogens and SRB increased, but the community composition of methanogens appeared to be influenced more than did the SRB.

AB  - Nutrient load into the ocean can be retained during the process of plant uptake and sedimentation in marshes along the bay zone. Seasonal variations of biomass and nutrient concentration in three dominated plant assemblages and associated sediments were monitored in this study area to determine effects of salt marsh on nutrient retention. Results showed that plant aboveground biomass displayed a unimodal curve with nutrient concentration generally decreased from spring to winter. Belowground biomass was relatively low during the rapid growth period with nutrient concentration tending to decrease and then increase during this period. Plant total nitrogen (TN) pools are higher than total phosphorus (TP) pools, and both pools showed significant seasonal variations. Water purification coefficients (WPC) of nutrients by plant assimilation were 34.4/17.3, 19.3/24.0, and 5.14/6.04 t/(m(2) year) (TN/TP) for Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, and Scirpus mariqueter, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that higher annual plant biomass and nutrient assimilation contribute to greater nutrient retention capacity and accumulation in sediments, thereby enabling reduced eutrophication in transitional waters.

AB  - Hemisphere scale events such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can alter rainfall regimes worldwide, with important effects on species abundance and distribution. The evidence of ENSO effects on terrestrial communities is, however, restricted to a few ecosystem types. We explored the effects of ENSO episodes on plant/terrestrial-herbivore interactions through changes in the rainfall regime in a southwestern Atlantic salt marsh (Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina. 37 degrees 40'S, 57 degrees 23'W). Surveys showed a positive relationship between winter rainfall and the abundance of the wild guinea pig Cavia aperea. The highest salt marsh abundances of C. aperea were associated with rainy periods during El Nino episodes, and the lowest ones were associated with the driest La Nina episodes. Rainfall was negatively associated with marsh sediment salinity, and experiments revealed that increased salinity reduces growth and increases mortality of cordgrass (Spartina densiflora). Salt increase also causes the highest percentage of dry area in S. densiflora leaves and reduced carbon content, and more salt content and secretion in S. densiflora stems. A factorial experiment in which we manipulated C. aperea presence and salinity along the edges of S. densiflora patches showed that plants can asexually invade unvegetated areas when salinity is reduced and C. aperea is excluded. Conversely, S. densiflora edges retracted when salinity was increased or there was C. aperea herbivory. Changes in nutritional quality of S. densiflora could explain the low herbivory of (and lack of impacts from) C. aperea in plots with high salinity. Thus, plant distribution responds directly to climate oscillations through changes in salt stress, and indirectly, through changes in plant-herbivore interactions. Herbivores respond indirectly to climate oscillations through changes in plant food quality, which suggests that top-down effects increase when bottom-up stressors are relaxed. ENSO events have direct and indirect effects on marsh communities that modulate the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects and have a considerable effect on the primary productivity of S. densiflora marshes.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms and controlling factors of ecosystem CO2 exchange in tidal wetlands is of great benefit for research concerning the global carbon cycle and climate change. In spite of this, the multiple controls of ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange in coastal wetlands subject to subdaily tidal flooding have yet to be adequately addressed. In this study, we investigated the tidal influence on ecosystem CO2 exchange in a Phragmites salt marsh of an intertidal shoal in the Changjiang estuary, based on eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The results revealed that the study area acted as a strong sink for atmospheric CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE = -901 g C m(-2)) in 2018. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature (T-a), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were major drivers of NEE on both diel and multi-day scales. The fides, along with the bio-meteorological variables, strongly affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) in the tidal wetland, especially on the multi-day scale. Regardless of which flux partitioning method was utilized, tidal inundation generally imposed inhibitory effects on GPP, which were directly attributed to tidal water level (TWL) and salinity. The daytime data-based estimates of R-eco was also suppressed on average under the tidal inundation condition when T-a was higher relative to the non-inundation condition, reflecting the influence of TWL on R-eco and the reduced sensitivity of R-eco to T-a. We observed that NEE responded positively or negatively to tidal flooding, depending on the magnitude of tidal suppression on GPP and R-eco. When T-a was roughly between 28 and 32 degrees C and PAR was > 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), GPP was suppressed by fides more than R-eco during the early and rapid vegetative stage, while during the peak vegetative stage, the opposite was true. This study not only shows the unique impact of tidal salt marsh wetlands on carbon uptake, but it also represents an example of a coastal wetland in which tidal inundation promotes the net uptake of CO2.

AB  - Annual carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus leachate rates from live Spartina alterniflora Loisel in a Louisiana (USA) salt marsh were estimated to be 200, 14, and 3 g M-2, respectively, and to peak in summer and higher salinities. Leachate losses of P, N and C are equivalent to a turnover of live plant tissues of 10, 17 and 49 d, respectively, when submerged, and 148, 250 and 721 d, respectively, when unsubmerged. Plant leachate losses during marsh submergence and non-submergence are nearly equal because release rates are 15 x greater during submergence. Nitrogen and carbon concentrations relative to phosphorus are proportionately 4 x higher in leachates than in live plant tissues. The amounts released are high enough to account for measured seasonal changes in the heterotrophic rates of the estuarine plankton community. Leachates appear to be an underappreciated yet significant nutrient and carbon source for salt marsh food webs, and of potential widespread significance for many other estuarine communities.

AB  - Direct measurement of methane emissions is cost-prohibitive for greenhouse gas offset projects, necessitating the development of alternative accounting methods such as proxies. Salinity is a useful proxy for tidal marsh CH4 emissions when comparing across a wide range of salinity regimes but does not adequately explain variation in brackish and freshwater regimes, where variation in emissions is large. We sought to improve upon the salinity proxy in a marsh complex on Deal Island Peninsula, Maryland, USA by comparing emissions from four strata differing in hydrology and plant community composition. Mean CH4 chamber-collected emissions measured as mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) ranked as S. alterniflora (1.2 +/- 0.3) >> High-elevation J. roemerianus (0.4 +/- 0.06) > Low-elevation J. roemerianus (0.3 +/- 0.07) = S. patens (0.1 +/- 0.01). Sulfate depletion generally reflected the same pattern with significantly greater depletion in the S. alterniflora stratum (61 +/- 4%) than in the S. patens stratum (1 +/- 9%) with the J. roemerianus strata falling in between. We attribute the high CH4 emissions in the S. alterniflora stratum to sulfate depletion likely driven by limited connectivity to tidal waters. Low CH4 emissions in the S. patens stratum are attributed to lower water levels, higher levels of ferric iron, and shallow rooting depth. Moderate CH4 emissions from the J. roemerianus strata were likely due to plant traits that favor CH4 oxidation over CH4 production. Hydrology and plant community composition have significant potential as proxies to estimate CH4 emissions at the site scale.

AB  - Salt-marsh sediments provide accurate and precise reconstructions of late Holocene relative sea-level changes. However, compaction of salt-marsh stratigraphies can cause post-depositional lowering (PDL) of the samples used to reconstruct sea level, creating an estimation of former sea level that is too low and a rate of rise that is too great. We estimated the contribution of compaction to late Holocene sea-level trends reconstructed at Tump Point, North Carolina, USA. We used a geotechnical model that was empirically calibrated by performing tests on surface sediments from modern depositional environments analogous to those encountered in the sediment core. The model generated depth-specific estimates of PDL, allowing samples to be returned to their depositional altitudes. After removing an estimate of land-level change, error-in-variables changepoint analysis of the decompacted and original sea-level reconstructions identified three trends. Compaction did not generate artificial sea-level trends and cannot be invoked as a causal mechanism for the features in the Tump Point record. The maximum relative contribution of compaction to reconstructed sea-level change was 12%. The decompacted sea-level record shows 1.71 mm yr(-1) of rise since AD 1845.

AB  - Phagotrophic ciliates are capable of growth solely on dissolved compounds in laboratory cultures. Whether ciliates use dissolved compounds in the environment for growth is unclear. We investigated the ability of the marine benthic ciliate Uronema marinum to ingest a model high molecular weight dissolved organic carbon (HMW-DOC) compound, dextran, at concentrations typical for coastal salt marsh sediments (3 mu M to 3 mM C). Ingestion was measured by incubating ciliates with fluorescein-labeled dextran (2000 kDa) and measuring the fluorescence signal of the labeled compound in cells via flow cytometry. Ciliates accumulated dextran (relative to formalin-killed controls) at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg l(-1) dextran (3 mu M C). Labeled dextran accumulated in food vacuoles and near the buccal cavity; thus, the ingestion of dextran appears to be a consequence of feeding activities rather than transport across the cell membrane via parasomal sac formation. Dextran accumulation did not increase with higher bacterial ingestion rates. Instead, dextran accumulation was greatest at intermediate bacterial concentrations and grazing rates. Ciliate growth rates were measured in treatments amended with model carbon compounds-soluble starch, acetate, and glucose (3 mM C, final concentrations). There was no significant increase in ciliate growth rates with these compounds in either bacteria-free or bacteria-enriched treatments. Rather, growth rates were significantly lower in treatments with DOC addition, indicating that processing of these DOC compounds may incur some energetic cost to these ciliates.

AB  - A sediment core collected in Caminha tidal marsh, NW Portugal, was used to assess bromine (Br) signal over the last ca. 1700 years. The Br temporal variability reflects its close relationship with soil/sediment organic matter (OM) and also alterations in Br biogeochemical recycling in marsh environment. The highest Br enrichment in sediments was found during the Maunder Solar Minimum, a major solar event characterized by lower irradiance crso and temperature, increased cloudiness and albedo. The obtained results suggest that those climate-induced changes weakened the natural mechanisms that promote Br biochemical transformations, driven by both living plants metabolism and plant litter degradation, with the ensuing generation of volatile methyl bromide (CH3Br). It seems that the prevailing climate conditions during the Maunder favoured the retention of more Br in marsh ecosystem, ultimately decreasing the biogenic Br emissions to the atmosphere. During the 20th century, the Br pattern in sediments appears to mirror likewise anthropogenic sources. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between Br/OM ratios and Pb contents in sediments after 1934 suggests a common source. This is most probably related with the rise, massive consumption and prohibition of leaded gasoline, where ethylene dibromide was added as lead scavenger to antiknock mixtures. More regionally, the concerted use of flame retardants on forest fire management, covering the 1980s through mid-1990s in the north of Portugal and Galicia, could be responsible for the observed increase of sediment Br (relatively to Pb) pool of this tidal marsh. Although man-made brominated compounds are being phased-out since the inception of the 1992 Montreal Protocol, the Caminha tidal marsh sedimentary record showed that Br levels only started to decline after 2002.

AB  - Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) release from wetland soils to overlying waters is important to consider when restoring wetland hydrology Soil physicochemical characteristics influence P dynamics between underlying soil and overlying water Our study initially characterized wetland and surrounding upland soils prior to flooding Deep marsh wetland soils had greater moisture content, soil organic matter, nitrogen (N). P. and lower bulk density than surrounding upland pasture soils, which indicates a nutrient concentration gradient between wetland and upland soils To determine the short-term P dynamics between soils and overlying water, we conducted four laboratory soil water cote studies during a 15-month period Surface soils (0-10 cm) collected October 2005, February 2006, October 2006 and December 2006 from wetlands and their surrounding uplands within cow-calf grazed pastures were flooded for 7 clays, and we measured P release from soil to overlying water Phosphorus release rates from wetland (deep marsh and shallow marsh) and upland soils were similar Values ranged between -20 mg m(-2) d(-1) (retention) and 77 mg m(-2) d(-1) (release) There was a significant, although weak, negative linear relationship between P release nom deep marsh soils and hydroperiod Thus, it may be important for land managers to consider increasing hydroperiod of wetland soils to decrease P release and increase retention In addition, there was a significant negative exponential relationship between P release and days since deep marsh soil inundation This suggests that to decrease P release from soils, soils should be wet rather than dry for prolonged periods, prior to flooding We found significant relationships between P release from upland soils and their nutrient content (N, P and carbon) Reducing nutrient content in upland soils may help reduce the magnitude of P release from soil (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - To investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and understand the key controlling factors, we explored N2O fluxes and environmental variables in high marsh (HM), middle marsh (MM), low marsh (LM), and mudflat (MF) in the Yellow River estuary throughout a year. Fluxes of N2O differed significantly between sampling periods as well as between sampling positions. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O fluxes ranged from -0.0051 to 0.0805 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1), and high N2O emissions occurred during spring (0.0278 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and winter (0.0139 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) while low fluxes were observed during summer (0.0065 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and autumn (0.0060 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The annual average N2O flux from the intertidal zone was 0.0117 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1), and the cumulative N2O emission throughout a year was 113.03 mg N2O m(-2), indicating that coastal marsh acted as N2O source. Over all seasons, N2O fluxes from the four marshes were significantly different (p < 0.05), in the order of HM (0.0256 +/- 0.0040 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > MF (0.0107 +/- 0.0027 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > LM (0.0073 +/- 0.0020 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)) > MM (0.0026 +/- 0.0011 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1)). Temporal variations of N2O emissions were related to the vegetations (Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Tamarix chinensis) and the limited C and mineral N in soils during summer and autumn and the frequent freeze/thaw cycles in soils during spring and winter, while spatial variations were mainly affected by tidal fluctuation and plant composition at spatial scale. This study indicated the importance of seasonal N2O contributions (particularly during non-growing season) to the estimation of local N2O inventory, and highlighted both the large spatial variation of N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh (CV = 158.31 %) and the potential effect of exogenous nitrogen loading to the Yellow River estuary on N2O emission should be considered before the annual or local N2O inventory was evaluated accurately.

AB  - Long-term sediment accretion and nutrient concentrations were investigated in tidal marsh sediments of the Murderkill River, Delaware. Radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137), stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15), organic matter concentrations and nutrient concentrations were measured. Tidal marsh sediment accumulation rates ranged from 0.10 to 0.20 g cm(-2) yr(-1), and accretion rates ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 cm yr(-1). The Carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio (similar to 24) was higher in the downcore of upstream sites, and a similar C/N ratio was identified in surface sediment cores at the downstream sites. The sediment N concentration in the surface sediments was highest at the upstream sites (mostly >= 1% of N) and decreased downstream. Total nitrogen concentrations were highest from 1910 to 1920 (similar to 1.5% N), decreased to approximately 0.6% N by 1940, and then remained constant to present. The dominance of the C4 plant Spartina (cordgrass) over C3 plants after the 1940s may be due to an upward movement of saline water associated with hydrologic changes and a rise in relative sea level. Surface sediments in all of the cores have more total phosphorus (TP) than below ground. The downstream site closest to the estuary had an abrupt increase in surface TP (i.e., 0-10 cm). Sediment TP increased slightly from 2003 to present time (i.e., from 0.07 to 0.11% P). Sediment accumulation and accretion rates in the Murderkill River marshes are similar to the accretion rates determined by previous studies in the region.

AB  - The benthic macroinvertebrates of the Nakdong River estuary were sampled at three different habitats: two salt marsh (Scirpus triqueter and Phragmites australis) beds and a bare intertidal flat. Fishes were sampled in the main channel. The trophic importance of marsh vascular plants, microphytobenthos, and riverine and channel particulate organic matter to macroinvertebrate and fish production was studied using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers. There was a dramatic change in coverage of macrophytes (salt marshes and seagrass) after the construction of an estuarine barrage in 1987 in the Nakdong River estuary, with the S. triqueter bed increasing, the P. australis bed decreasing, and Zostera marina habitats being nearly lost. Although the invertebrate delta C-13 were within a narrower range than those of the primary producers, the values varied considerably among consumers in these habitats. However, the isotope signatures of consumers showed similarities among different habitats. Cluster analysis based on their isotopic similarity suggested that the isotope variability among species was related more to functional feeding groups than to habitats or taxonomic groups. While delta C-13 values of suspension feeders were close to that of the channel POM (mainly phytoplankton), other benthic feeders and predators had delta C-13 similar to that of microphytobenthos. Isotopic mixing model estimates suggest that algal sources, including microphytobenthos and phytoplankton, play an important role in supporting the benthic food web. Despite the huge productivity of emergent salt marshes, the contribution of the marsh-derived organic matter to the estuarine food webs appears to be limited to some nutrition for some invertebrates just within marsh habitats, with little on the bare intertidal flats or in the channel fish communities. Isotope signatures of the channel fishes also confirm that algal sources are important in supporting fish nutrition. Our findings suggest that benthic and pelagic microalgae made a large contribution to consumer diets, while marsh plants may not have a large role in supporting food webs in this estuarine system.

AB  - Mitigation of petroleum hydrocarbons was investigated during a 5-month greenhouse experiment, to assess the rhizoremediation (RR) potential in sediments with different characteristics colonized by Juncus maritimus, a salt marsh plant commonly found in temperate estuaries. Furthermore, the efficiency of two bioremediation treatments namely biostimulation (BS) by the addition of nutrients, and bioaugmentation (BA) by addition of indigenous microorganisms, was tested in combination with RR. The effect of the distinct treatments on hydrocarbon degradation, root biomass weight, and bacterial community structure was assessed. Our result showed higher potential for hydrocarbon degradation (evaluated by total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis) in coarse rhizosediments with low organic matter (OM), than rhizosediments with high OM, and small size particles. Moreover, the bacterial community structure was shaped according to the rhizosediment characteristics, highlighting the importance of specific microbe-particle associations to define the structure of rhizospheric bacterial communities, rather than external factors, such as hydrocarbon contamination or the applied treatments. The potential for hydrocarbon RR seems to depend on root system development and bacterial diversity, since biodegradation efficiencies were positively related with these two parameters. Treatments with higher root biomass, and concomitantly with higher bacterial diversity yielded higher hydrocarbon degradation. Moreover, BS and BA did not enhance hydrocarbons RR. In fact, it was observed that higher nutrient availability might interfere with root growth and negatively influence hydrocarbon degradation performance. Therefore, our results suggested that to conduct appropriate hydrocarbon bioremediation strategies, the effect of sediment characteristics on root growth/exploration should be taken into consideration, a feature not explored in previous studies. Furthermore, strategies aiming for the recovery of bacterial diversity after oil spills may improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated salt marsh sediments.

AB  - Macrotidal salt marshes play an important role in sedimentary processes in estuaries and can act as a sink for fine sediments and contaminants. This study examines sedimentation rates and the history of heavy metal accumulation in the Allen Creek salt marsh in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Pb-210 and Cs-137 measurements and accelerated mass spectrometer (AMS) dating indicate a sedimentation rate of about 1.1 cm/year, which is consistent with independent observations. Elevated normalized concentrations of As in the upper section of the deposit may reflect an increase in organic matter content while a consistent decrease in Mn toward the surface of the section may be due to a decrease in natural supply. A peak in metal concentrations in the early to mid twentieth century is attributed to inputs from local foundries.

AB  - In situ plant production is often assumed to be the major contributor to organic matter (OM) accumulation and vertical accretion in tidal marshes. Here, we evaluate the contribution of mud-associated OM in salt and brackish marshes in Louisiana. Based on 14 soil cores, the OM content of the mud fraction-i.e., any material smaller than 64 mu m-was 17% +/- 7% for the salt marshes and 28% +/- 14% for the brackish marshes. This remains nearly uniform over the top 35 cm depth, suggesting that this material is deposited contemporaneously with the mud. The dry bulk density of the mud (300-450 kg m(-3)) is also much lower than what was estimated using a previously proposed two-constituent mixing model (1990 kg m(-3)). To reconcile this discrepancy, we developed a modified mixing model that includes mud OM and differentiates sand as a separate constituent with its high dry bulk density. The model estimates that mud contributes to similar to 60% of the total marsh vertical accretion in Louisiana, considerably higher than the similar to 14% estimated with the two-constituent mixing model. The result, which is a direct consequence of the relatively high porosity of mud, highlights that mud deposition is crucial for the accretion of microtidal marshes. Further, the model estimates that the mud OM constitutes similar to 60% of the total soil OM, emphasizing that in situ plant production is not the only-and, in minerogenic marshes, not the major-contributor to OM accumulation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant sources of methane in the atmosphere, but emissions in these ecosystems are still poorly quantified, as in situ data are limited. In this study, we present the first assessment of spatio-temporal changes in air-water CH4 fluxes in the salt marshes of the Donana wetlands (SW Spain), one of the most emblematic protected areas in Europe, due to its high biotic diversity and unique importance for aquatic wildfowl. The marshes are flooded by estuarine waters from the adjacent Guadalquivir River by tidal intrusion, which influences aquatic CH4 dynamics by changing salinity and water chemistry which affects sedimentary methanogenesis. During sixteen samplings, conducted between March 2016 and March 2018, surface water CH4 concentrations were measured using static-head space equilibration gas chromatography in seven sites representing salt marshes located in the land strip close to the estuary. Because of meteorological conditions and tide variations, salinity markedly changed across the salt marshes, although sites located closer to the river mouth could be categorized as polyhaline marshes whereas upstream sites formed a group of mesohaline marshes. The CH4 saturation range was 252-36,735% (average 5,170%) and 374-620,007% (average 31,541%) in polyhaline and mesohaline marshes, respectively, suggesting the inhibitory effect of sulfate on methanogenesis, although a linear trend between dissolved CH4 concentration and salinity was not observed. In contrast, water temperature and chlorophyll a were significantly and positively correlated with methane, indicating sedimentary methanogenesis control by temperature, and organic matter availability boosted by primary productivity. This does not exclude the possibility that some CH4 might also come from estuarine inputs. Air-water CH4 fluxes ranged from 2.6 to 720 mu mol m(-2)d(-1) (average 104 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) in the polyhaline marshes and from 5.6 to 12,715 mu mol m(-2)d(-1) (average 637 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) in the mesohaline marshes, with higher emissions measured during the summer months in all sites. Even though the strongest environmental drivers of dissolved CH4 accumulation seemed to be temperature and productivity, the spatio-temporal patterns observed suggest that methane dynamics in the Donana salt marshes are controlled by a mosaic of processes rather than by a single environmental force.

AB  - Salt marsh ecosystems are maintained by the dominant macrophytes that regulate the elevation of their habitat within a narrow portion of the intertidal zone by accumulating organic matter and trapping inorganic sediment. The long-term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level, land elevation, primary production, and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long-period cycles of sea level, and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity. We describe a theoretical model that predicts that the system will be stable against changes in relative mean sea level when surface elevation is greater than what is optimal for primary production. When surface elevation is less than optimal, the system will be unstable. The model predicts that there is an optimal rate of RSLR at which the equilibrium elevation and depth of tidal flooding will be optimal for plant growth However, the optimal rate of RSLR also represents an upper limit because at higher rates of RSLR the plant community cannot sustain an elevation that is within its range of tolerance. For estuaries with high sediment loading, such as those on the southeast coast of the United States, the limiting rate of RSLR was predided to be at most 1.2 cm/yr, which is 3.5 times greater than the current, long-term rate of RSLR.

AB  - Conversion of wetlands by drainage for agriculture or other anthropogenic activities could have a negative or positive feedback to global warming (GWF). We suggest that a major predictor of the GWF is salinity of the wetland soil (a proxy for available sulfate), a factor often ignored in other studies. We assess the radiative balance of two northern salt marshes with average soil salinities > 20 ppt, but with high (macro-) and low (micro-) tidal amplitudes. The flux of greenhouse gases from soils at the end of the growing season averaged 485 +/- 253 mg m(-2) h(-1), 13 +/- 30 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 19 +/- 58 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the microtidal marsh and 398 +/- 201 mg m(-2) h(-1), 2 +/- 26 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and 35 +/- 77 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in the macrotidal marsh for CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. High rates of C sequestration mean that loss of these marshes would have a radiative balance of -981CO(2-)eq. m(-2) yr(-1) in the microtidal and -567CO(2-)eq.m(-2)yr(-1) in the macrotidal marsh.

AB  - The Cr speciation in marsh soils developed in weathering chromite ore processing residue (COPR) was characterized using sequential extractions and synchrotron microbeam and bulk X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) analyses. The sequential extractions suggested substantial Cr associated with reducible and oxidizable soil components, and significant non-extractable residual Cr. Notable differences in Cr speciation estimates from three extraction schemes underscore the operationally defined nature of Cr speciation provided by these methods. Micro X-ray fluorescence maps and mu-XAS data indicated the presence of mu m-sized chromite particles scattered throughout the weathered COPR matrix. These particles derive from the original COPR material, and have relatively high resistance towards weathering. and therefore persist even after prolonged leaching. Bulk XAS data further indicated Cr(III) incorporated in Fe(OH)(3), and Cr(III) associated with organic matter. The low Cr contents of the weathered material (200-850 ppm) compared to unweathered COPR (20,000-60,000 ppm) point to substantial Cr leaching during COPR weathering, with partial repartitioning of released Cr into secondary Fe(OH)(3) phases and organics. The effects of anoxia on Cr speciation, and the potential of active COPR weathering releasing Cr(VI) deeper in the profile require further study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Depending on their location along an estuarine salinity gradient, tidal marshes are thought to have different impacts on the chemical composition of the water during flooding. However, there is a lack of direct measurements of fluxes occurring between the marsh surface and the water column to corroborate this hypothesis. This study compared fluxes of nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) between the water column and the marsh surface and the emission of greenhouse gases, at four sites located along the salinity gradient of an estuary of north-western Wales (UK). The exchanges of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DON), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), soluble reactive phosphorus and silicic acid, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were measured during tidal inundation in May and September 2008 using in situ incubation chambers. There was no linear pattern along the salinity gradient and the concentration of nutrients and DOC in the flood water did not appear to control the biogeochemical processes driving the marsh surface/water column exchanges in the studied marshes. Multivariate analysis showed a clear discrimination in functioning between sites with the fresh and brackish marshes having a more similar functioning compared to low and middle marshes. The main differences between these two groupings were in the fluxes of DOC and nitrate. The phenology of plant species, soil organic matter content and soil oxygenation appear be the dominant factors explaining the observed fluxes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analysed the changes in the zooplankton composition in several new and old lagoons in La Pletera, a confined Mediterranean coastal salt marsh located in the Baix Ter wetlands (NE Iberian Peninsula) that was subjected to a restoration project (Life Pletera). We sampled the zooplankton from three new lagoons immediately after their creation (1 and 2 months after), and we compared the zooplankton with those of three existing lagoons, two natural lagoons and one lagoon created fourteen years ago in a previous restoration project. The sampling included seven months before the first hydrological connection to the surface waters, when flooding during a sea storm connected the new lagoons with the existing lagoons for the first time, and seven months after. The results showed that the nutrient and organic matter concentrations were lower in the new lagoons than in the old lagoons, suggesting accumulation processes in these ecosystems, which were probably related to the long periods of confinement that typically follow flooding events in this type of lagoons. However, we did not find significant differences in the zooplankton community between the old and new lagoons. The seasonal variation in the zooplankton communities was strongly affected by the seasonal hydrological flooding - confinement pattern, which did not differ between the old and new lagoons. Calanoid copepods, mainly Eurytemora velox, dominated during winter, while the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis dominated in summer, coinciding with the highest degree of confinement. The environmental variables and the hydric connection explained 31 % of the zooplankton variability. The high connectivity of the system once it flooded aided dispersal, the hatching of the egg banks existing in the restored lagoons and the fast response of the zooplankton species to changes in the environmental conditions (although with some degree of delay) might explain the lack of significant differences between the zooplankton composition in the old and new lagoons.

AB  - Sediments colonised by three halophyte species, Spartina maritima (Curtis) Fernald, Halimione portulacoides (L.) Aellen and Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) Scott) and bulk sediment from a SW European salt marsh (Tagus estuary, Portugal) were subjected to sequential extractions and analysed to assess the rare earth elements (REE) geochemical fractionation and to evaluate the plants' role in the mobility and bioavailability of these elements. The results showed that REE were mainly bound to the residual (yttrium and heavy-REE) and carbonate (middle-REE and heavy-REE) fractions, followed by the reducible and oxidisable (light-REE and middle-REE) fractions, while the easily soluble fraction was negligible. This fractionation evidenced a sediment REE mobility mainly dependent not only on carbonates but also on Fe=Mn oxyhydroxides and on organic matter content. On the other hand, REE associated with the reducible and oxidisable fractions, and particularly the redoxsensitive Ce, may becomemore available, due to the redox condition seasonal changes that occur in saltmarshes' sediments promoted by the plants' activity. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the REE bioavailability depends not only on the sediments' characteristics and the plants' seasonal activity but also on the specificity of each element, as demonstrated by the different fractionation patterns observed in the various sedimentary fractions.

AB  - Soil P availability has been identified as one of the key factors controlling wetland productivity, structure, and function. Soil P fractions at different depths in newly formed wetlands along a salinity gradient in Yellow River Delta (China) were studied using a modified Hedley fraction method. The total P (Pt) content ranged from 471.1 to 694.9 mg?kg1, and diluted HCl-extractable inorganic P (Dil-HCl-Pi) ranged from 324 to 524.2 mg?kg1. The Dil-HCl-Pi is the predominant P form in all profiles, with on average 70% of the Pt extracted as Pi. Organic P (Po) comprised (4.2 +/- 2.0)% (mean +/- SD) of the Pt, due to low organic-matter content in coastal salt marsh ecosystems. The labile P (resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi, and NaHCO3-Po) and moderately labile P (NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po) concentrations were both low, ranged from 11.6 to 38.1 and 2.8 to 21.3 mg?kg1, respectively, constituting (3.7 +/- 1.1)% and (2.0 +/- 0.7)%, respectively, of Pt, suggesting low availability of P to plants in these soils. Our results suggested that vegetation cover significantly influenced soil P dynamics and availability. In particular, the labile P content under Tamarix chinensis increased significantly by 23.2%145.5% compared with adjacent soils. These findings have important implications for wetland conservation or restoration and long-term sustainable management of newly formed wetland ecosystems in the Yellow River Delta.

AB  - Constructed marshes in San Diego Bay (California, USA) have short canopies of the cordgrass Spartina foliosa and soils that are low in organic matter and nitrogen, compared to natural salt marshes of this area. Thus, we hypothesized that organic and nitrogen amendments would accelerate plant growth and enrich soil nitrogen pools. A field experiment in a newly excavated mitigation site examined the effects of adding ammonium sulfate (N), nitrogen-rich alfalfa (with or without added N), and nitrogen-poor straw (with or without added N) prior to planting. Aboveground biomass and stem densities of cordgrass were proportional to the amount of N added, whether in the organic or inorganic form. Alfalfa decomposed more rapidly than straw, but in both cases, N was lost quickly (50-66% in 2 wk). Sediment nitrogen and carbon pools were not increased significantly by the amendments. High decomposition rates and sandy soils apparently prevented accumulation of N in the nutrient and/or organic matter pools. Less than 5% of the nitrogen potentially available for uptake was actually recovered in aerial tissue. With N-poor soil and high nutrient-loss rates, the experimental plots developed less than half the aboveground biomass found in reference natural cordgrass marshes. Amending soils prior to transplantation did not achieve the goal of functional equivalency with natural marshes, and after 2 yr there was no indication that nutrient pools or plant growth rates would achieve natural levels.

AB  - We performed plant removal (devegetation) experiments across a suite of ecologically diverse wetland settings (tidal salt marshes, river floodplain, rotational rice fields, and freshwater wetlands with permanent or seasonal flooding) to determine the extent to which the presence (or absence) of actively growing plants influences the activity of the Hg(II)-methylating microbial community and the availability of Hg(II) to those microbes. Vegetated control plots were paired with neighboring devegetated plots in which photosynthetic input was terminated 4-8 months prior to measurements, through clipping aboveground biomass, severing belowground connections, and shading the sediment surface to prevent regrowth. Across all wetlands, devegetation decreased the activity of the Hg(II)-methylating microbial community (k(meth)) by 38%, calculated MeHg production potential (MP) rates by 36%, and pore water acetate concentration by 78%. Decreases in MP were associated with decreases in microbial sulfate reduction in salt marsh settings. In freshwater agricultural wetlands, decreases in MP were related to indices of microbial iron reduction. Sediment MeHg concentrations were also significantly lower in devegetated than in vegetated plots in most wetland settings studied. Devegetation effects were correlated with live root density (percent volume) and were most profound in vegetated sites with higher initial pore water acetate concentrations. Densely rooted wetlands had the highest rates of microbial Hg(II)-methylation activity but often the lowest concentrations of bioavailable reactive Hg(II). We conclude that the exudation of labile organic carbon (e. g., acetate) by plants leads to enhanced microbial sulfate and iron reduction activity in the rhizosphere, which results in high rates of microbial Hg(II)-methyation and high MeHg concentrations in wetland sediment.

AB  - We collected sediment cores from three salt marsh ponds in coastal Louisiana to test the usefulness of proxies of eutrophication. One-centimeter increments of Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated sediment were analyzed for diatoms, pigments (phaeophytin and chlorophyll a), biogenic silica, percentage organic matter, percentage carbon, and percentage nitrogen. Both sediment chlorophyll a and a diatom-based trophic index (TI) were significantly and positively correlated with riverine or local nutrient indices. Two diatom species, Amphora copulata Giffen and Navicula yarrensis Grunow, were significantly and negatively correlated with riverine and local nutrient indices. These results suggest that these variables can be used as potential indicators of trophic status. Results from a complete-linkage cluster analysis on the diatom assemblage data demonstrated that the sediment cores could be split into three time periods: early 1900s (pre-1930s/1940s), mid-1900s (1930s/40s to 1960s/1970s), and late 1900s (1960snos to 1990s). Examination of the sediment chlorophyll a and TI data over these time periods, coupled with an analysis of variance of nutrient inputs between the time periods, suggests that nutrient loading increased dramatically from the mid1960s to the mid-1970s. This study demonstrates that (1) a retrospective analysis of sediment cores can be conducted in highly variable salt marsh ponds and (2) these salt marsh environments are already affected by the higher nutrient loads from both riverine and local processes occurring over the last 50 years. Additional nutrient loading, e.g., from river diversion projects for the lower Mississippi River, may exacerbate eutrophication already evident in the marsh environment.

AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) optical properties were measured in surface and pore waters as a function of depth and distance from an oil well in a southern California salt marsh. Higher fluorescence and absorbances in pore vs. surface waters suggest soil pore water is a reservoir of CDOM in the marsh. Protein-like fluorophores in pore waters at distinct depths corresponded to variations in sulfate depletion and Fe(II) concentrations from anaerobic microbial activity. These variations were supported by fluorescence indexes and are consistent with differences in optical molecular weight and aromaticity indicators. Fluorescence indices were consistent with autochthonous material of aquatic origin in surface waters, with more terrestrial, humified allochthonous material in deeper pore waters. CDOM optical properties were consistent with significantly enhanced microbial activity in regions closest to the oil well, along with a three-dimensional excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectrum peak attributable to oil, suggesting anaerobic microbial degradation of oil.

AB  - Many studies have attempted to predict whether coastal marshes will be able to keep up with future acceleration of sea-level rise by estimating marsh accretion rates. However, there are few studies focussing on the long-term effects of herbivores on vegetation structure and subsequent effects on marsh accretion. Deposition of fine-grained, mineral sediment during tidal inundations, together with organic matter accumulation from the local vegetation, positively affects accretion rates of marsh surfaces. Tall vegetation can enhance sediment deposition by reducing current flow and wave action. Herbivores shorten vegetation height and this could potentially reduce sediment deposition. This study estimated the effects of herbivores on 1) vegetation height, 2) sediment deposition and 3) resulting marsh accretion after long-term (at least 16 years) herbivore exclusion of both small (i.e. hare and goose) and large grazers (i.e. cattle) for marshes of different ages. Our results firstly showed that both small and large herbivores can have a major impact on vegetation height. Secondly, grazing processes did not affect sediment deposition. Finally, trampling by large grazers affected marsh accretion rates by compacting the soil. In many European marshes, grazing is used as a tool in nature management as well as for agricultural purposes. Thus, we propose that soil compaction by large grazers should be taken in account when estimating the ability of coastal systems to cope with an accelerating sea-level rise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are likely to influence future distributions of plants and plant community structure in many regions of the world through effects on photosynthetic rates. In recent decades the encroachment of woody mangrove species into herbaceous marshes has been documented along the U.S. northern Gulf of Mexico coast. These species shifts have been attributed primarily to rising sea levels and warming winter temperatures, but the role of elevated CO2 and water availability may become more prominent drivers of species interactions under future climate conditions. Drought has been implicated as a major factor contributing to salt marsh vegetation dieback in this region. In this greenhouse study we examined the effects of CO2 concentration (similar to 380 ppm, similar to 700 ppm) and water regime (drought, saturated, flooded) on early growth of Avicennia germinans, a C-3 mangrove species, and Spartina alterniflora, a C-4 grass. Plants were grown in monocultures and in a mixed-species assemblage. We found that neither species responded to elevated CO2 over the 10-month duration of the experiment, and there were few interactions between experimental factors. Two effects of water regime were documented: lower A. germinans pneumatophore biomass under drought conditions, and lower belowground biomass under flooded conditions regardless of planting assemblage. Evidence of inter-specific interactions was noted. Competition for aboveground resources (e.g., light) was indicated by lower S. alterniflora stem biomass in mixed-species assemblage compared to biomass in S. alterniflora monocultures. Pneumatophore biomass of A. germinans was reduced when grown in monoculture compared to the mixed-species assemblage, indicating competition for belowground resources. These interactions provide insight into how these species may respond following major disturbance events that lead to vegetation dieback. Site variation in propagule availability and physico-chemical conditions will determine plant community composition and structure following such disturbances when these two species co-occur.

KW  - COAST
AB  - The inorganic content of 51 dated sediment cores from Mississippi River deltaic plain salt marsh wetlands peaks with the landfall of hurricanes. Variations in the inorganic sediment content demonstrate no temporal coherence with changes in either the Mississippi River suspended matter concentration or discharge, or with wetland losses on this coast. The inorganic matter brought to wetlands during hurricanes is sufficient to account for the accumulated inorganic sediment, and the volume averages 9% of the soil volume. A "sediment deficit'' hypothesis, which makes a causal connection between a changing inorganic supply and the dramatically high wetland losses on this coast, is therefore rejected. Our results support the hypothesis that wetlands of an undeveloped coast receive the majority of their inorganic sediments from offshore and not from overbank flooding or through crevasses. Restoration and wetland maintenance (prevention) goals should be implemented with this in mind: the coastal wetland losses of the last century along this coast appear to be a consequence of the diminished accumulation of organic matter and not from variations in inorganic sediment loading.

AB  - Sea-level rise is a major factor in wetland loss worldwide, and in much of Chesapeake Bay (USA) the rate of sea-level rise is higher than the current global rate of 3.2 mm yr(-1) due to regional subsidence. Marshes along estuarine salinity gradients differ in vegetation composition, productivity, decomposition pathways, and sediment dynamics, and may exhibit different responses to sea-level rise. Coastal marshes persist by building vertically at rates at or exceeding regional sea-level rise. In one of the first studies to examine elevation dynamics across an estuarine salinity gradient, we installed 15 surface elevation tables (SET) and accretion marker-horizon plots (MH) in tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and brackish marshes across a Chesapeake Bay subestuary. Over the course of four years, wetlands across the subestuary decreased 1.8 +/- 2.7 mm yr(-1) in elevation on average, at least 5 mm yr(-1) below that needed to keep pace with global sea-level rise. Elevation change rates did not significantly differ among the marshes studied, and ranged from -9.8 +/- 6.9 to 4.5 +/- 4.3 mm yr(-1). Surface accretion of deposited mineral and organic matter was uniformly high across the estuary (similar to 9-15 mm yr(-1)), indicating that elevation loss was not due to lack of accretionary input. Position in the estuary and associated salinity regime were not related to elevation change or surface matter accretion. Previous studies have focused on surface elevation change in marshes of uniform salinity (e.g., salt marshes); however, our findings highlight the need for elevation studies in marshes of all salinity regimes and different geomorphic positions, and warn that brackish, oligohaline, and freshwater tidal wetlands may be at similarly high risk of submergence in some estuaries.

AB  - The Pacific Estuarine Ecosystem Indicators Research Consortium seeks to develop bioindicators of toxicant-induced stress and bioavailability for wetland biota. Within this framework, the effects of environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2-year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43% of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34% of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs. The strong relationships observed between pollutant concentrations and some of the microbial indicators indicated the potential for using microbial community analyses in assessments of the ecosystem health of salt marshes.

AB  - 1. The species-specificity of litter processing by three species of isopods at the interface between salt marsh and coastal forest habitats in the south-eastern United States was examined.
   2. To quantify isopod performance, measurements were taken of feeding, digestion and growth of isopods fed on three litter types (Juncus roemerianus , Quercus virginiana and Pinus palustris ) and on artificial diets containing one of three classes of model phenolic compounds (simple phenolics and hydrolysable and condensed tannins).
   3. To quantify the ecosystem impact of isopods, promotion of microbial respiration, changes in detritus chemistry, and the quantity of litter processed by isopod populations were measured.
   4. The results support three hypotheses concerning isopod-litter interactions. (i) Isopod performance on different litter types can be predicted based on chemical litter traits, e.g. phenolic concentrations and C : N ratios. (ii) Fully terrestrial isopods are better adapted to the range of phenolics found in angiosperm litter than are semiterrestrial species inhabiting the supralittoral. (iii) Isopod species differ with respect to their impact on decomposition processes due to species-specific digestive capabilities, different effects on microbial decomposition and different rates of net litter processing.
   5. Because isopods are transitional between semiterrestrial and terrestrial habitats, unlike most other salt marsh detritivores, they are likely to play a unique role in decomposition processes and in the flux of materials between salt marsh and terrestrial habitats.

AB  - Rationale Determining the flow of energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels in complex systems remains an important task for ecologists. Biomarkers can be used to trace carbon or energy sources contributing to an organism's tissues. However, different biomarkers vary in their ability to trace carbon sources based on how faithfully they transfer between trophic levels. Comparing emerging biomarker techniques with more commonly used techniques can demonstrate the relative efficacy of each in specific systems. Methods Two common biomarker techniques, fatty acid analysis (FAA) and bulk stable isotope analysis (SIA), and one emerging biomarker technique, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), were compared to assess their ability to characterize and quantify basal carbon sources supporting the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus), a common salt marsh species. Herbivorous insect and deposit-feeding fiddler crab biomarker values were analyzed as proxies of major terrestrial and aquatic basal carbon sources, respectively. Results All three biomarker techniques indicated that both terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources were important to seaside sparrows. However, FAA could only be evaluated qualitatively, due to a currently limited understanding of trophic modification of fatty acids between primary producer and this consumer's tissues. Quantitative stable isotope (SIA or CSIA-AA) mixing models predicted nearly equal contributions of terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources supporting seaside sparrows, yet estimates based on CSIA-AA had greater precision. Conclusions These findings support the use of CSIA-AA as an emerging tool to quantify the relative importance of basal carbon sources in salt marsh consumers. Integrating multiple biomarker techniques, with their differing benefits and limitations, will help to constrain models of carbon and energy flow in future ecosystem studies.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs; i.e., mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) play a critical role in global carbon (C) cycling, storing 10x more C than temperate forests. Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, can form in the sediments of these ecosystems. Currently, CH4 emissions are a missing component of VCE C budgets. This review summarizes 97 studies describing CH4 fluxes from mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass ecosystems and discusses factors controlling CH4 flux in these systems. CH4 fluxes from these ecosystems were highly variable yet they all act as net methane sources (median, range; mangrove: 279.17, -67.33 to 72,867.83; salt marsh: 224.44, -92.60 to 94,129.68; seagrass: 64.80, 1.25-401.50 mu mol CH4 m(-2) day(-1)). Together CH4 emissions from mangrove, salt marsh, and seagrass ecosystems are about 0.33-0.39 Tmol CH4-C/year-an addition that increases the current global marine CH4 budget by more than 60%. The majority (~45%) of this increase is driven by mangrove CH4 fluxes. While organic matter content and quality were commonly reported in individual studies as the most important environmental factors driving CH4 flux, they were not significant predictors of CH4 flux when data were combined across studies. Salinity was negatively correlated with CH4 emissions from salt marshes, but not seagrasses and mangroves. Thus the available data suggest that other environmental drivers are important for predicting CH4 emissions in vegetated coastal systems. Finally, we examine stressor effects on CH4 emissions from VCEs and we hypothesize that future changes in temperature and other anthropogenic activites (e.g., nitrogen loading) will likely increase CH4 emissions from these ecosystems. Overall, this review highlights the current and growing importance of VCEs in the global marine CH4 budget.

AB  - Total concentrations and fractionation of Cu, Zn and Pb in seven operationally defined phases (exchangeable, carbonates, manganese oxides, organic complexes, amorphous iron oxides, crystalline iron oxides and residual) were determined in sediments colonised by the halophyte species Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima in a Tagus estuary salt marsh (Portugal). We aimed to determine whether the speciation of these metals was different in areas colonised by each halophyte. Higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and, in particular Pb, were found in the rhizosphere of S. maritima than in the root sediments of H. portulacoides. Geochemical fractionation of Cu, Zn and Pb in sediments of the salt marsh depended upon the metal, and for Zn and Pb clearly varied with depth and with the colonising species. The higher redox potential observed in sediments colonised by H. portulacoides may in part explain the observed differences in the speciation of Cu, Zn and Pb. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changes in atmospheric mercury deposition are used to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations controlling emissions. This analysis can be complicated by seemingly incongruent data from different model runs. model types, and field measurements. Here we present a case study example that describes how to identify trends in regional scale mercury deposition using hest-available information from Multiple data sources. To do this, we use data from three atmospheric chemistry models (CMAQ. GEOS-Chem. HYSPLIT) and Multiple sediment archives (ombrotrophic bog, headwater lake, coastal salt marsh) from the Bay of Fundy region in Canada. Combined sediment and modeling data indicate that deposition attributable to US and Canadian emissions has declined in recent years. thereby increasing the relative significance of global sources. We estimate that anthropogenic emissions in the US and Canada account for 28-33% of contemporary atmospheric deposition in this region. with the rest from natural (14-32%) and global sources (41-53%).

AB  - Aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter (MOM), and wetland soil characteristics were measured periodically between 1983 and 1998 in a created brackish-water marsh and a nearby natural marsh along the Pamlico River estuary, North Carolina to evaluate the development of wetland vegetation and soil dependent functions after marsh creation. Development of aboveground biomass and MOM was dependent on elevation and frequency of tidal inundation. Aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora , which occupied low elevations along tidal creeks and was inundated frequently, developed to levels similar to the natural marsh (750 to 1,300 g/m(2) ) within three years after creation. Spartina cynosuroides , which dominated interior areas of the marsh and was flooded less frequently, required 9 years to consistently achieve aboveground biomass equivalent to the natural marsh (600 to 1,560 g/m(2) ). Aboveground biomass of Spartina patens , which was planted at the highest elevations along the terrestrial margin and seldom flooded, never consistently developed aboveground biomass comparable with the natural marsh during the 15 years after marsh creation. MOM (0 to 10 cm) generally developed at the same rate as aboveground biomass. Between 1988 and 1998, soil bulk density decreased and porosity and organic C and N pools increased in the created marsh. Like vegetation, wetland soil development proceeded faster in response to increased inundation, especially in the streamside zone dominated by S. alterniflora. We estimated that in the streamside and interior zones, an additional 30 years (nitrogen) to 90 years (organic C, porosity) are needed for the upper 30 cm of created marsh soil to become equivalent to the natural marsh. Wetland soil characteristics of the S. patens community along upland fringe will take longer to develop, more than 200 years. Development of the benthic invertebrate-based food web, which depends on organic matter enrichment of the upper 5 to 10 cm of soil, is expected to take less time. Wetland soil characteristics and functions of created irregularly flooded brackish marshes require longer to develop compared with regularly flooded salt marshes because reduced tidal inundation slows wetland vegetation and soil development. The hydrologic regime (regularly vs. irregularly flooded) of the "target" wetland should be considered when setting realistic expectations for success criteria of created and restored wetlands.

AB  - To avoid submergence during sea-level rise, coastal wetlands build soil surfaces vertically through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter. At climatic boundaries where mangroves are expanding and replacing salt marsh, wetland capacity to respond to sea-level rise may change. To compare how well mangroves and salt marshes accommodate sea-level rise, we conducted a manipulative field experiment in a subtropical plant community in the subsiding Mississippi River Delta. Experimental plots were established in spatially equivalent positions along creek banks in monospecific stands of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) or Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and in mixed stands containing both species. To examine the effect of disturbance on elevation dynamics, vegetation in half of the plots was subjected to freezing (mangrove) or wrack burial (salt marsh), which caused shoot mortality. Vertical soil development was monitored for 6 years with the surface elevation table-marker horizon system. Comparison of land movement with relative sea-level rise showed that this plant community was experiencing an elevation deficit (i.e., sea level was rising faster than the wetland was building vertically) and was relying on elevation capital (i.e., relative position in the tidal frame) to survive. Although Avicennia plots had more elevation capital, suggesting longer survival, than Spartina or mixed plots, vegetation type had no effect on rates of accretion, vertical movement in root and sub-root zones, or net elevation change. Thus, these salt marsh and mangrove assemblages were accreting sediment and building vertically at equivalent rates. Small-scale disturbance of the plant canopy also had no effect on elevation trajectoriescontrary to work in peat-forming wetlands showing elevation responses to changes in plant productivity. The findings indicate that in this deltaic setting with strong physical influences controlling elevation (sediment accretion, subsidence), mangrove replacement of salt marsh, with or without disturbance, will not necessarily alter vulnerability to sea-level rise.

AB  - A full-scale controlled experiment was conducted on an excavated and re-assembled coastal wetland surface, typical of floristically diverse northwest European saltmarsh. The experiment was undertaken with true-to-scale water depths and waves in a large wave flume, in order to assess the impact of storm surge conditions on marsh surface soils, initially with three different plant species and then when this marsh canopy had been mowed. The data presented suggests a high bio-geomorphological resilience of salt marshes to vertical sediment removal, with less than 0.6cm average vertical lowering in response to a sequence of simulated storm surge conditions. Both organic matter content and plant species exerted an important influence on both the variability and degree of soil surface stability, with surfaces covered by a flattened canopy of the salt marsh grass Puccinellia experiencing a lower and less variable elevation loss than those characterized by Elymus or Atriplex that exhibited considerable physical damage through stem folding and breakage.

AB  - 1 A factorial fertilizer experiment was conducted in a 15-year-old coastal barrier salt marsh with a low soil nitrogen content, and in an older 100-year-old marsh with a higher nitrogen content. Plots were fertilized at high and low marsh elevations in both marshes. Nitrogen and phosphorus were applied at low and high concentrations both separately and in combination in each of 3 successive years.
   2 Nitrogen limited above-ground plant growth in both young and old salt marshes in all years. Phosphorus limitation of plant growth was apparent in the first year in the young marsh and in the last year in both marshes. In young marshes with low soil organic matter, phosphorus limitation may occur. In addition, phosphorus limitation occurs at both successional stages when a marsh is saturated with nitrogen.
   3 Plant species that are typical of nitrogen-rich habitats and late successional stages significantly increased in biomass after fertilization. Limonium vulgare, a low stature species of early and intermediate successional stages, decreased in biomass, whereas the taller Elymus pycnanthus and Artemisia maritima increased. After 3 years of fertilization, plant species composition in a young marsh was similar to the species composition in an unfertilized older marsh. Fertilization of a 100-year-old marsh, however, still resulted in a change in plant species composition, suggesting that succession was still occurring and that, overall, plants in marshes of different age are similar in their response to fertilization.

AB  - Horizontal and profile distributions of nitrogen in marsh soils in different seasons were studied in a typical site within the Erbaifangzi wetland in Northeast China. Results showed that there was higher spatial heterogeneity for nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), as well as available nitrogen (AN), in surface soils in July compared to that in September. Relative to July, the mean nitrogen contents in surface soils were slightly higher in September; however, in November, soils contained significantly lower NO3--N and NH4+-N, higher AN, organic nitrogen (Org-N), and total nitrogen (TN). Except for mineral nitrogen, no significant differences were observed between Org-N and TN contents in September and November. Nitrogen contents generally declined exponentially with depth along soil profiles in three sampling dates (July, September, and November), except for a significant accumulation peak of NO3--N at the 20-30 cm depth in September. However, NH4+-N contents showed a vertical alternation of "increasing and decreasing" in both July and September, while nearly kept constant with depth in November. The depth ranking of nitrogen showed the shallowest distribution for AN, followed by Org-N and TN, while deeper distributions for NO3--N and NH4+-N. TN, Org-N, and AN were significantly correlated with soil organic matter and total phosphorus. Soil pH values were significantly correlated with TN and AN contents in surface soils. Clay contents showed significant correlations with nitrogen contents except for NO3--N in surface soils and NH4+-N in profile soils. However, soil moisture was not significantly correlated with nitrogen contents among all soil samples.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Large quantities of sediment deposited in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary by the Changjiang River promote the propagation of coastal wetlands, the expansion of saltmarsh vegetation, and carbon sequestration. In this study, using the Chongming Dongtan Wetland in the Changjiang estuary as the study area, the spatial and temporal distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and the influences of sedimentation and vegetation on the SOC stocks of the coastal wetland were examined in 2013. There was sediment accretion in the northern and middle areas of the wetland and in the Phragmites australis marsh in the southern area, and sediment erosion in the Scirpus mariqueter marsh and the bare mudflat in the southern area. More SOC accumulated in sediments of the vegetated marsh than in the bare mudflat. The total organic carbon (TOC) stocks increased in the above-ground biomass from spring to autumn and decreased in winter; in the below-ground biomass, they gradually increased from spring to winter. The TOC stocks were higher in the below-ground biomass than in the above-ground biomass in the P. australis and Spartina alterniflora marshes, but were lower in the below-ground biomass in S. mariqueter marsh. Stocks of SOC showed temporal variation and increased gradually in all transects from spring to winter. The SOC stocks tended to decrease from the high marsh down to the bare mudflat along the three transects in the order: P. australis marsh > S. alterniflora marsh > S. mariqueter marsh > bare mudflat. The SOC stocks of the same vegetation type were higher in the northern and middle transects than in the southern transect. These results suggest that interactions between sedimentation and vegetation regulate the SOC stocks in the coastal wetland in the Changjiang estuary.

AB  - An 87-day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of various water levels on the soil nitrogen content in an inland salt marsh of Xianghai, China. Soil samples were collected from depths in the range of 0 to 30 cm at 10-cm intervals after 15, 54 and 87 days of incubation. The total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) contents and the nitrogen activation coefficient (NAC) were measured to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics under three inundation treatments (-5, 0 and 5 cm). The results showed that TN was generally accumulated in all soil layers and exhibited a peak value in subsurface soils at the -5-cm inundation level at the end of the incubation period, whereas no obvious changes were observed in the TN contents in the bottom soils at the three inundation levels. Compared with the initial contents in the soils, the NO3--N and NH4+-N contents were significantly reduced in all soil layers at the 0-cm and the 5-cm inundation levels at the end of the incubation period. In general, the available nitrogen content was higher in the surface soils compared with the deeper soils at all inundation levels. The NAC values exhibited a pronounced change in the subsurface soils at all inundation levels, decreasing significantly from 0.17 to 0.04 at the 5-cm inundation level; however, a higher mean NAC value (0.126) was found over the incubation period at the 0-cm inundation level compared with the 5-cm and the -5-cm inundation levels. Nitrogen was released from plants into the soil under all inundation treatments over the incubation period. The soil organic matter exerted positive loadings on the TN and NO3--N contents and negative loadings on the NH4+-N content at all inundation levels, and the water content generally exhibited a negative relationship with all forms of nitrogen. Additionally, the total phosphorus content exhibited a positive correlation with the TN and NO3--N contents. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The effects of drought on salt marsh sediments from Sapelo Island, Georgia, were examined in flow-through reactor experiments. Three hydrological treatments were employed: a continuously flooded anoxic control, a periodic drought treatment that experienced alternate periods of flooding and drying, and a severe drought treatment, where sediment was exposed to drought (drying) for several weeks and then flooded; the effect of both buffered and non-buffered flooding solutions were examined. In permanently anoxic sediments as well as in sediments exposed to drought, organic carbon oxidation was dominated by SO4 (2-) reduction (SR) and SR rates increased over time. The shift from anoxic to oxic conditions in drought treatments significantly altered sediment geochemistry and pathways of microbial metabolism. Drought conditions favored suboxic mineralization processes, such as Fe(III) reduction and denitrification, which was fueled by NH4 (+) oxidation promoted by O-2 delivered during drought conditions. Other major drought-induced changes included pH decrease, and altered concentrations of solid phase adsorbed metals.

AB  - There is a lack of a comprehensive study of eastern Adriatic salt marsh vegetation with special attention to plant-soil relationships that determine individual plant assemblages. We surveyed 41 sites of salt marshes on the Croatian coastline in order to classify their vegetation by numerical methods and to compare the resulting groups in terms of soil chemical properties. A clear zonation between plant communities along the hydro-sequence was identified and was well represented by the dominance of individual diagnostic species. Two large vegetation groups were detected, well distinguished by mean species richness and soil properties. The first group, assigned into the classes Thero-Salicornietea and Sarcocornietea fruticosae, contains three subgroups of succulent, sparse stands of species-poor vegetation on the mudflat zone flooded by sea water, characterised by high salinity, electric conductivity, exchangeable Mg and K, and low nutrient content (total nitrogen, organic carbon) of the substrate. In the second group, tall rush communities (class Juncetea maritimi), three subordinate clusters, were identified, occurring in the upper, brackish zone with infrequent tides. Their soils had low salinity and electric conductivity and increased total nitrogen, organic carbon and exchangeable Mg and Ca. Vegetation within the second group occurring in the uppermost tidal zone had the highest species-richness, nutrient content in the soil and the lowest salinity. It has not been previously identified. Here, we described it as the new association Limonio narbonensis-Caricetum divisae.

AB  - 1 Submergence of coastal wetlands in Louisiana is currently rapid and widespread. A number of factors contribute to this loss of habitat, including the activities of herbivores. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of large mammals, predominantly nutria and wild boar, on processes controlling soil elevation in coastal marshes.
   2 Effects of herbivores on soil and vegetation were assessed by the use of paired fenced and unfenced plots over two successive growing seasons. Above-ground biomass, Litter production, changes in soil elevation, vertical soil accretion, shallow subsidence, below-ground production of roots and rhizomes, the thickness of the root zone, soil bulk density, and soil organic matter were measured.
   3 Above-ground biomass, below-ground production, soil elevation and the expansion of the root zone decreased due to herbivore activity. Litter production, the rate of soil surface accretion and shallow soil subsidence were all higher in grazed compared to unrated plots, while soil organic matter and bulk density did not differ significantly between treatments.
   4 The results indicate that herbivores can have a negative effect on soil building processes, primarily by reducing below-ground production and expansion of the root zone. Where natural rates of mineral sediment deposition are high, coastal marshes are expected to persist, despite herbivore activities. However, where sediment inputs are substantially less, herbivores may lead to destruction of habitat.

AB  - The wetlands on the Zoige Plateau have experienced serious degradation, with most of the original marsh being converted to marsh meadow or meadow. Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities.

AB  - Soil fungal communities drive diverse ecological processes and are critical in maintaining ecosystems' stability, but the effects of plant invasion on soil fungal diversity, community composition, and functional groups are not well understood. Here, we investigated soil fungal communities in a salt marsh ecosystem with both native (Suaeda salsa) and exotic (Spartina alterniflora) species in the YellowRiver Delta. We characterized fungal diversity based on the PCR-amplified Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) DNA sequences from soil extracted total DNA. The plant invasion evidently decreased fungal richness and phylogenetic diversity and significantly altered the taxonomic community composition (indicated by the permutation test, P < 0.001). Co-occurrence networks between fungal species showed fewer network links but were more assembled because of the high modularity after the invasion. As indicated by the fungal Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac distances, the fungal community became homogenized with the invasion. FUNGuild database analyses revealed that the invaded sites had a higher proportion of saprophytic fungi, suggesting higher organic matter decomposition potential with the invasion. The plant invasion dramatically inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi, which may facilitate the expansion of invasive plants in the intertidal habitats. Soil pH and salinity were identified as the most important edaphic factors in shaping the fungal community structures in the context of Spartina alterniflora invasion. Overall, this study elucidates the linkage between plant invasion and soil fungal communities and poses potential consequences for fungal contribution to ecosystem function, including the decomposition of soil organic substrates.

AB  - Radium isotopes provide unique and important information concerning water exchange in a salt marsh-tidal creek system. Seasonal radium data collected over five tidal cycles from a creek draining a South Carolina salt marsh, radium and thorium data from the adjacent marsh sediments, and interstitial water radium data from the drainage basin are modeled to yield residence times of water in the upper 10 cm of the marsh sediments ranging from less than one to twenty-six hours. Water residence times derived from chambers which directly measure the flux of Ra isotopes to the creek waters agree well with these calculated interstitial water turnover times.
   Dissolved radium activities in the tidal creek were greater during the summer than during other times of the year. We suspect that seasonal changes in the storage of organic carbon and rates of bioturbation lead to net reduction of radium carrier phases in the marsh sediments during the summer.

AB  - Fe (III) reduction is a key component of the global iron cycle, and an important control on carbon mineralization. However, little is known about the relative roles and rates of microbial (biotic) iron reduction, which utilizes organic matter, versus abiotic iron reduction, which occurs without carbon mineralization. This paper reports on the capacity for salt marsh sediments, which typically are rich in iron, to support abiotic reduction of mineral Fe (III) driven by oxidation of sulphide. Sediment was reacted with amorphous FeS under strictly anaerobic conditions at a range of temperatures in biotic and abiotic microcosm experiments. Fe (III) reduction driven by sulphide oxidation occurs abiotically at all temperatures, leading to Fe (II) and elemental sulphur production in all abiotic experiments. In biotic experiments elemental sulphur is also the oxidized sulphur product but higher bicarbonate production leads to FeCO3 precipitation. Abiotic reduction of Fe (III) occurs at rates that are significant compared with microbial Fe (III) reduction in salt marsh sediments. The solid phases produced by coupled abiotic and biotic reactions, namely elemental sulphur and FeCO3, are comparable to those seen in nature at Warham, Norfolk, UK. Furthermore, the rates of these processes measured in the microcosm experiments are sufficient to generate siderite concretions on the rapid time scales observed in the field. This work highlights the importance of abiotic Fe (III) reduction alongside heterotrophic reduction, which has implications for iron cycling and carbon mineralization in modern and ancient sediments.

AB  - Microbial interactions driving key biogeochemical fluxes often occur within multispecies consortia that form spatially heterogeneous microenvironments. Here, we describe the "green berry" consortia of the Sippewissett salt marsh (Falmouth, MA, United States): millimeter-sized aggregates dominated by an uncultured, diazotrophic unicellular cyanobacterium of the order Chroococcales (termed GB-CYN1). We show that GB-CYN1 is closely related to Crocosphaera watsonii (UCYN-B) and "Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa" (UCYN-A), two groups of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that play an important role in marine primary production. Other green berry consortium members include pennate diatoms and putative heterotrophic bacteria from the Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Tight coupling was observed between photosynthetic oxygen production and heterotrophic respiration. When illuminated, the green berries became supersaturated with oxygen. From the metagenome, we observed that GB-CYN1 encodes photosystem II genes and thus has the metabolic potential for oxygen production unlike UCYN-A. In darkness, respiratory activity rapidly depleted oxygen creating anoxia within the aggregates. Metagenomic data revealed a suite of nitrogen fixation genes encoded by GB-CYN1, and nitrogenase activity was confirmed at the whole-aggregate level by acetylene reduction assays. Metagenome reads homologous to marker genes for denitrification were observed and suggest that heterotrophic denitrifiers might co-occur in the green berries, although the physiology and activity of facultative anaerobes in these aggregates remains uncharacterized. Nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean was long thought to be driven by filamentous cyanobacterial aggregates, though recent work has demonstrated the importance of unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria (UCYN) from the order Chroococcales.The green berries serve as a useful contrast to studies of open ocean UCYN and may provide a tractable model system to investigate microbial dynamics within phytoplankton aggregates, a phenomenon of global importance to the flux of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen in surface waters.

AB  - Microplastics are widely dispersed in the coastal and marine environment, and sediments are considered to be sinks for microplastics. In this study, a total of 53 sediment samples were removed from different depths of two sediment cores collected in Andong salt marsh, Hangzhou Bay. The microplastics were extracted from the sediment cores through a density floating separation method. The shape, size, and color of the microplastics was then observed under a microscope. Polymer types were identified using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average abundance of microplastics was 13.2 +/- 6.0 items 50 g(-1) dry weight. The main components of microplastics were polystyrene, cellophane, polyethylene and polypropylene. The quantities of microplastics at different depths in the sediment cores were consistent with the history of microplastic pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution that affects salt marshes is a major environmental concern due to its toxic nature, persistence, and potential risk to organisms and to human health. Mining waste deposits originated four decades ago, by the metallurgical extraction of heavy metals, are found near to the San Antonio salt marsh in Patagonia. The aim of the work was to determine the geochemical processes that control the distribution and concentration of Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn in the soils of this Patagonian salt marsh. A survey of themining waste deposits was carried outwhere three dumpswere identified. Samples were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter and metal contents and the soil mineralogical composition. The results shows that the soils developed over the miningwaste deposits are predominantly reddish constitutedmainly by iron oxide, hydroxide and highly soluble minerals such as Zn and Cu sulphates. The drainage from these deposits tends to move towards the salt marsh. Within the salt marsh, the highest concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occur in the sectors closest to the mining wastes deposits. The sulphide oxidation and the dissolution of the Cu, Pb and Zn sulphates could be the mainly source of these metals in the drainage water. The metals in solution that reach the salt marsh, are adsorbed by the organic matter and the fine fraction of the soils. These adsorbed metals are then remobilized by tides in the lower sectors of the marsh by desorption from the cations present in the tidal flow. On the other hand, Fe tends to formnon soluble oxides, hydroxides and sulphateswhich remain as alteringmaterialwithin the mining waste deposit. Finally, the heavymetal pollutants recorded in the San Antonio saltmarsh shows that the mining waste deposits that were abandoned four decades ago are still a source metal contamination.

AB  - Boreal peatlands are a major global C sink, thus having important feedbacks to climate. A decreased concentration in atmospheric CO2 7000-10 000 yr ago has been linked to variations in peatland C accumulation rates attributed to a warm climate and increased productivity. Yet, this period also corresponds to early stages of peatland development (as peatland was expanding) following retreat of ice sheets and increases in C storage could be associated with wetland evolution via lake filling or following marine shoreline emergence. Unravelling past links amongst peatland dynamics, C storage, and climate will help us assess potential feedbacks from future changes in these systems, but most studies are hampered by low temporal resolution. Here we provide a decadal scale C accumulation record for a fen that has begun transformation from salt marsh within the last 70 yr on the isostatically rebounding coast of James Bay, Qu,bec. We determined time frames for wetland stages using palynological analyses to reconstruct ecological change and Pb-210 and Cs-137 to date the deposit. The average short-term C accumulation rates during the low and high tidal marsh and incipient fen stage (42, 87 and 182 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) were as much as six times higher than the global long-term (millennial) average for northern peatlands. We suggest that the atmospheric CO2 flux during the early Holocene could be attributed, in part, to wetland evolution associated with isostatic rebound, which makes land for new wetland formation. Future climate warming will increase eustatic sea level, decrease rates of land emergence and formation of new coastal wetlands, ultimately decreasing rates of C storage of wetlands on rebounding coastlines.

AB  - Extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) of five enzymes (peroxidase, phenol oxidase, beta-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was analysed in sediments colonised by Spartina maritima in two salt marshes (Rosario and Pancas) of the Tagus estuary (Portugal) with different characteristics such as sediment parameters and metal contaminant levels. Our aim was a better understanding of the influence of the halophyte on microbial activity in the rhizosphere under different site conditions, and its potential consequences for metal cycling and phytoremediation in salt marshes. Acid phosphatase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase presented significantly higher EEA in Rosario than in Pancas, whereas the opposite occurred for peroxidase. This was mainly attributed to differences in organic matter between the two sites. A positive correlation between root biomass and EEA of hydrolases (P-glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase) was found, indicating a possible influence of the halophyte in sediment microbial function. This would potentially affect metal cycling in the rhizosphere through microbial reactions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are a significant source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to coastal ecosystems, which impacts nutrient cycling, light exposure, carbon dynamics, phytoplankton activity, microbial growth, and ecosystem productivity. There is a wide variety of research on the properties and sources of DOM; however, little is known about the characteristics and degradation of DOM specifically sourced from tidal wetland plants. By conducting microbial and combined UV exposure and microbial incubation experiments of leachates from fresh and senescent plants in Chesapeake Bay wetlands, it was demonstrated that senescent material leached more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than fresh material (77.9 +/- 54.3 vs 21.6 +/- 11.8 mg DOC L-1, respectively). Degradation followed an exponential decay pattern, and the senescent material averaged 50.5 +/- 9.45% biodegradable DOC (%BDOC), or the loss of DOC due to microbial degradation. In comparison, the fresh material averaged a greater %BDOC (72.6 +/- 19.2%). Percent remaining of absorbance (83.3 +/- 26.7% for fresh, 90.1 +/- 10.8% for senescent) was greater than percent remaining DOC, indicating that colored DOM is less bioavailable than non-colored material. Concentrations of DOC leached, %BDOC, and SUVA280 varied between species, indicating that the species composition of the marsh likely impacts the quantity and quality of exported DOC. Comparing the UV + microbial to the microbial only incubations did not reveal any clear effects on %BDOC but UV exposure enhanced loss of absorbance during subsequent dark incubation. These results demonstrate the impacts of senescence on the quality and concentration of DOM leached from tidal wetland plants, and that microbes combined with UV impact the degradation of this DOM differently from microbes alone.

AB  - Tidal marshes have been previously shown to affect fluxes of carbon and nutrients in adjacent estuaries by acting as sources, sinks or transformers of compounds transported in water exchanged between the marsh and estuary. Relative to information on the amount and direction of these exchanges, much less is known about the distribution and fate of the distinctive dissolved organic compounds derived from marshes, and the spatial extent to which this 'marsh signature' affects optical and biogeochemical variability in the estuary. In the present study we address the spatial distribution of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as other biogeochemical components, in the Rhode River estuary-marsh complex of the Chesapeake Bay. High-spatial-resolution transects showed that the marshes are a major source of DOC, DIC and pCO(2) to the adjacent estuary and atmosphere, and that they seem to trap algae and other suspended particulate matter while releasing high-molecular-weight, aromatic-rich, highly colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into the estuary through tidal flushing. These processes result in strong variability in water characteristics considerably beyond the marsh-estuary interface. Non-conservative mixing in CDOM with salinity was probably due to both intense processing of the more labile marsh-exported components, as well as to mixing with other terrestrial and wetland inputs into the estuary. Despite the possible role of the adjacent subtidal mudflat as a sink for some of the material released from the marshes, the marsh signature was distinguishable from the regional estuarine background over a distance of more than 1 km into the river.

AB  - Foundation plant species play an important functional role in modifying microenvironment through vegetation structure and by influencing soil properties. Mangroves and salt marsh differ in vegetation structure, yet offer similar ecosystem services. This work aimed to understand how different vegetation classes and abiotic factors along a latitudinal gradient of spatial and temporal complexity affect soil CO2 efflux. Soil CO2 efflux, biomass, soil properties, and soil and air temperature were measured in July 2015 and January 2016 in situ at 10 sites along a 342-km latitudinal gradient on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Mean CO2 flux values ranged from 0.41 +/- 0.19 to 2.03 +/- 0.19molm(-2)s(-1) across vegetation classes, and efflux values in mangrove plots were not significantly different between sampling dates, whereas ecotone and salt marsh efflux values were. On average, CO2 flux was 1.11 +/- 0.18molm(-2)s(-1) greater in July than in January across plots. There was no significant trend between efflux and aboveground biomass and a positive trend between belowground biomass and CO2 efflux. Edaphic parameters (organic matter content (%), soil N, organic C, and pH) were comparable across all vegetation class soils and there was a positive trend between soil temperature and flux. Soil efflux had an inverse relationship with latitude; in January, there is an increase in efflux with a decrease in latitude, while in July, efflux increases with an increase in latitude. Consequently, we assert that differences in CO2 efflux were due to soil temperature and species productivity along the latitudinal gradient studied.

AB  - The lateral transport of carbon has been increasingly recognized as an important component of carbon budget in wetlands. We studied a typical coastal salt marsh located at the estuary of the Yangtze River by measuring lateral transfer of macro-detritus carbon within a creek during each month's largest spring tide period, and simultaneously, we measured the gross primary production (GPP) by the eddy covariance (EC) method. The results showed a bimodal seasonal pattern of net detritus carbon export, with one peak associated with mainly green/fresh carbon materials and the other peak associated with mainly yellow-dark/senescent carbon materials. We also found that the export of green detritus carbon was highly correlated with plant phenology and the height of tides, suggesting influences from both the standing stock of living biomass and the force of tides. GPP measured by the EC technique (GPP(EC)) and by remote sensing (GPP(RS)) differed substantially. We found this difference was correlated well with the net export of green macro-detritus. In general, we concluded that the lateral flux is an important component of the carbon budget in the marsh and that to cross validate between GPP(EC) and GPP(RS), it must be included as a calibration term for computing GPP(EC).

AB  - Reversible sorption of organic compounds in soils and sediments is a common assumption in assessing risk and determining remedial endpoints. However, the presence of a desorption-resistance phase has been widely reported in the literature. Recent work has suggested that the quality of organic matter is important in the magnitude of the desorption-resistant effect. For example, a series of wetland peats demonstrated little or no desorption resistance for phenanthrene (Huang and Weber, 1997). The goal of the present study was to determine if desorption-resistance is observed in recent deposited organic matter by studying wetland soils explicitly. Sorption/desorption characteristics for both surface marsh soil (top 0-2 cm, <5 years old) and deeper marsh soil (below 10-cm, >20 years old) were investigated to see whether soil age can cause differences in sorption/desorption in wetlands. Sorption-desorption of organic compounds (chlorobenzene and phenanthrene) in recently deposited freshwater marsh soils was determined using the batch desorption procedure of Kan et al. (1998). Adsorption was biphasic with about 30-62% (chlorobenzene) and 46.7-82.9% (phenanthrene) of the adsorbed mass residing in the desorption-resistant fraction after 7-14 desorption steps. Sorption/desorption parameters were determined for several of the currently proposed models for explaining the desorption resistance including the Tomson-Kan model, slow sorption model and dual reactive domain model (DRDM). All models indicated the presence of a sizeable desorption-resistant phase in wetland soils and an increase in the size of the desorption-resistance in "older" organic matter. Implications for wetland remediation are discussed.

AB  - Restoring and protecting "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows are actions considered for increasing global carbon sequestration. To improve understanding of which management actions produce the greatest gains in sequestration, we used a spatially explicit model to compare carbon sequestration and its economic value over a broad spatial scale (2500 km of coastline in southeastern Australia) for four management scenarios: (1) Managed Retreat, (2) Managed Retreat Plus Levee Removal, (3) Erosion of High Risk Areas, (4) Erosion of Moderate to High Risk Areas. We found that carbon sequestration from avoiding erosion-related emissions (abatement) would far exceed sequestration from coastal restoration. If erosion were limited only to the areas with highest erosion risk, sequestration in the non-eroded area exceeded emissions by 4.2 million Mg CO2 by 2100. However, losing blue carbon ecosystems in both moderate and high erosion risk areas would result in net emissions of 23.0 million Mg CO2 by 2100. The removal of levees combined with managed retreat was the strategy that sequestered the most carbon. Across all time points, removal of levees increased sequestration by only an additional 1 to 3% compared to managed retreat alone. Compared to the baseline erosion scenario, the managed retreat scenario increased sequestration by 7.40 million Mg CO2 by 2030, 8.69 million Mg CO2 by 2050, and 16.6 million Mg CO2 by 2100. Associated economic value followed the same patterns, with large potential value loss from erosion greater than potential gains from conserving or re-storing ecosystems. This study quantifies the potential benefits of managed retreat and preventing erosion in existing blue carbon ecosystems to help meet climate change mitigation goals by reducing carbon emissions.

AB  - Seasonal variation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in roots of the high salt marsh plant Spartina patens, the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the rhizosphere and plant growth performance was studied at key stages of the growing season coinciding with major plant phenological stages, i.e., vegetative growth, reproduction and senescence. AMF colonization was highest during vegetative growth, with values declining during the growing season to the same level seen at plant dormancy. AMF colonization was reduced at lower depths in the sediments where anoxic conditions were observed and in plants treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl. Only small changes in diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in general and more specifically of those belonging to the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria were detected during the season or between treatments by PCR-RFLP of nifH gene fragments with DNA as template for amplification; however, greater seasonal changes were displayed when cDNA was used as template for amplification as a proxy for gene expression and thus active bacteria. DGGE analyses of nifH gene fragments representing nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria using both using DNA and cDNA as template showed highly diverse profiles that changed during the season and in response to treatment. Seasonal changes were observed for a suite of plant growth attributes and differences were observed between treatments, with higher values generally obtained on non-treated plants compared to Benomyl-treated plants. These differences were most pronounced during vegetative growth; however, differences between non-treated and Benomyl-treated plants were reduced seasonally and disappeared by the onset of senescence. This study demonstrates seasonal changes in AMF colonization on S. patens and in the community structure of nitrogen-fixing members of the epsilon-subdivision of Proteobacteria in the plant root zone. Plant growth performance changed seasonally with some effects of Benomyl-treatment.

AB  - Phragmites australis is a common invasive reed of North American coastal marshes, and efforts to control or eradicate it often are included in coastal marsh restoration efforts. While much research has tested impacts of P. australis removal on plant and faunal communities, less is known about biogeochemical responses to P. australis removal. Since coastal marshes are valued for their robust carbon sequestration, understanding the effect of P. australis removal on marsh carbon cycling dynamics is important. Temporary P. australis aboveground biomass clearing conducted as part of a restoration effort provided an opportunity to evaluate changes in fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) during P. australis removal and recovery. In Experiment 1 (2014 growing season), GHG fluxes were compared between a P. australis stand cleared mechanically and recovered within months of initial removal and an uncleared stand in the same marsh system. CO2 uptake increased dramatically in the cleared stand as P. australis regrew, but CH4 emissions remained unchanged, demonstrating that P. australis did not directly contribute to CH4 emission. In Experiment 2 (2015 manipulations), to test mechanisms of P. australis' impact on GHG fluxes, fluxes (light and dark) were compared between unimpacted P. australis plots, cut P. australis plots with litter, and cleared P. australis plots without litter. P. australis cutting (independent of litter removal) resulted in increased CO2 and CH4 emissions. Recovery of P. australis directly drove the rapid recovery of CO2 uptake, and did not increase (and possibly attenuated) CH4 emissions. Results of this study suggest that at this site, P. australis removal, in the absence of native vegetation recovery, may exacerbate GHG emission of coastal marshes in the short term, and that longer-term impacts warrant investigation.

AB  - Wetland restoration significantly affects ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycles by changing soil physicochemical properties and plant properties. To reveal the effect of wetland restora-tion on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) storage, we measured the SOC and TN content and calculated their storage in a restoration chronosequence (1, 4, 8, 13, 17, 27 years) and compared them with those in a soybean field and a natural marsh, all in Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. Our results showed that the SOC and TN content and storage in the in-vestigated sites increased with restoration time. However, the restoration rate was faster in the first 8 years but slowed down after 8 years of restoration. The SOC and TN content and storage decreased with soil depths in the eight sites. After 27 years of restoration, the carbon and nitrogen storage in the restored site was 2.8 and 1.9 times that in the soybean field, respec-tively. However, the SOC and TN storage in the 27-year restored site was 45.3% and 35.1% lower than that in the natural marsh, respectively. The SOC and TN content, bulk density, moisture content, clay, and plant belowground biomass significantly impact the SOC and TN storage (P < 0.01). This study indicates that marsh restoration contributes to the accumulation of SOC and TN, but the restoration of SOC and TN storage to the level of natural marshes may take decades.

AB  - Prior meta-regression models (MRMs) of wetland values pool value estimates associated with diverse commodity types-for example recreation, flood control, nutrient cycling, habitat provision, nonuse value, and carbon sequestration. Neither theory nor economic intuition justify the inclusion of such dissimilar commodities within a single meta-analytic value function, leading to validity concerns. This article seeks to advance methods for commodity and welfare consistent MRMs, applied to a particular category of wetland values. We develop a wetland value MRM restricted to a specific wetland type (coastal marshes), general location (US and Canada), commodity type (habitat provision and services), and valuation approach (stated preference methods). Results indicate that willingness to pay per household for marsh habitat changes is responsive to scope, spatial scale, market extent, the type of habitat change, household characteristics, and other factors suggested by theory and intuition. Results supersede those of prior wetland value MRMs in terms of statistical performance, estimation of anticipated value surface patterns, and capacity to support conceptually valid benefit transfers. Comparison with an otherwise identical but less commodity consistent MRM demonstrates that commodity consistency leads to improved statistical and benefit transfer performance.

AB  - As the use of in situ burning for oil spill remediation in coastal wetlands accelerates, the capacity of this procedure to restore the ecological structure and function of oil-impacted wetlands becomes increasingly important. Thus, our research focused on evaluating the functional and structural recovery of a coastal marsh in South Louisiana to an in situ burn following a Hurricane Katrina-induced oil spill. Permanent sampling plots were set up to monitor marsh recovery in the oiled and burned areas as well as non-oiled and non-burned (reference) marshes. Plots were monitored for species composition, stem density, above- and belowground productivity, marsh resiliency, soil chemistry, soil residual oil, and organic matter decomposition. The burn removed the majority of the oil from the marsh, and structurally the marsh recovered rapidly. Plant biomass and species composition returned to control levels within 9 months; however, species richness remained somewhat lower in the oiled and burned areas compared to the reference areas. Recovery of ecological function was also rapid following the in situ burn. Aboveground and belowground plant productivity recovered within one growing season, and although decomposition rates were initially higher in the oiled areas, over time they became equivalent to those in reference sites. Also, marsh resiliency, i.e., the rate of recovery from our applied disturbances, was not affected by the in situ burn. We conclude that in situ burning is an effective way to remove oil and allow ecosystem recovery in coastal marshes.

AB  - Wetland restoration is increasingly used as a strategy both to address historical wetland losses and to mitigate new wetland impacts. Research has examined the success of restored wetlands for avifaunal habitat, plant biodiversity, and plant cover; however, less is known about soil development in these systems. Soil processes are particularly important as soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and other properties are directly linked to wetland functions such as water quality improvement. This research compared soil development processes and properties of 30 palustrine depressional wetlands of four different age classes (similar to 5, 14, 35, and 55 years since restoration) located in central New York (USA). Five natural wetlands were used as references. This chronosequence included wetlands 27 years older than previously conducted studies, making it the longest reported database available. Replicated soil cores from each site were analyzed for SOM, bulk density (D-b), CEC, and concentrations of nutrients and other chemical constituents. Decomposition rate and aboveground plant and litter biomass were measured as key contributors to soil development. The results indicate that some soil properties critical for water quality functions take decades or centuries to reach natural reference levels. Of particular importance, in the top five centimeters of soil, SOM, D-b, and CEC achieved <50% of reference levels 55 years after restoration. Soil development processes in these depressional wetlands appear to be driven by autochthonous inputs and by internal processes such as litter decomposition and are not accelerated in the initial phase of development by allochthonous inputs as has been documented in coastal salt marshes and riverine floodplains. While monitoring generally focuses on the initial establishment phase of restored ecosystems, our findings indicate that the later autogenic phase strongly influences development trajectories for important wetland soil properties. Therefore, the role of different successional phases in determining long-term trajectories of ecosystem development should be considered in restoration design, research, and monitoring. This research highlights areas for improving the field of restoration through understanding of successional processes, increased efforts to jump-start soil development, longer-term monitoring programs, and greater focus on soil components of restored wetlands.

AB  - In response to current threats to salt marshes, there are increasing efforts to restore these vital coastal ecosystems and promote their resilience to global change drivers. Unfortunately, the economic cost associated with assessing the effectiveness of restoration is prohibitive and more information is needed about the trajectory and timing of restoration outcomes to improve restoration practices. Microbial communities provide essential salt marsh functions so assessing the degree to which microbial communities in restored marshes resemble reference marshes can serve as a proxy indicator for the potential return of microbial function. We studied a recently restored marsh located on Cape Cod, MA, USA, by examining shifts in the microbial community and sediment edaphic properties in three habitats of a degraded oligohaline marsh, both before and after restoration of tidal flooding and in comparison with three nearbyS. alterniflorareference marshes that never had flow restrictions. We hypothesized that the microbial community would respond rapidly to the restoration and that over time these communities would be indistinguishable from reference marsh communities. We found that soil edaphic characteristics shifted along a trajectory of recovery toward the reference marshes, with increases in salinity and decreases in soil organic matter, percentage of carbon, and percentage of nitrogen. The microbial communities in all three habitats within the restored marsh were different from reference marshes, and both the prokaryotic and fungal communities withinP. australisandTyphasp. habitats became more similar to reference marshes (similarities increasing from an average of 5 to 16% for prokaryotes and 3 to 10% for fungi) during the first 2 years after restoration. In that same time period, by contrast, there was no return of the native marsh vegetation. These results suggest that shifts in microbial community structure occur prior to shifts in marsh vegetation and may facilitate the successful revegetation of restored marshes. Understanding the recovery trajectory of marshes during restoration and the role that microbes play in promoting the long-term sustainability of these habitats is essential; these results suggest that microbial communities respond rapidly and in a positive direction to restoration efforts.

AB  - Investigations on how desiccation changes sorption of organic compounds by salt marsh sediments provide insight into the physical and chemical properties of these wide-spread coastal sediments. We measured sorption of compounds with different polarities (lysine, tyrosine, naphthalene and aniline) onto natural sediments and sediments that were dried and rewetted. Sorption of lysine by marsh sediment decreased significantly when the sediment was dried using a freeze-drier, oven, or desiccator. and sorption capacity was not restored when sediments were rewetted. In contrast to lysine, the sorption capacity of more hydrophobic compounds (tyrosine, aniline and naphthalene) increased significantly after salt marsh sediment was dried. These results suggest that drying greatly increased sediment hydrophobicity. Consistently, water drop penetration time, an index of hydrophobicity, was significantly lower for combusted sediments than for those that were simply dried. Sediments treated with EDTA, or boiled in seawater, exhibited a similar or even greater reduction in lysine sorption capacity compared with sediments that were dried. Water retention capacity of salt marsh sediment decreased 50% after sediment was dried. The effects of pH and salinity on lysine sorption in wet and dry sediments suggest that carboxyl groups play a major role in lysine sorption through cation ion exchange, and drying may reduce access to carboxyl groups. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of organic matter, originating mainly from Spartina alterniflora, is an important factor controlling sorption capacity in salt marsh sediment. The drying process makes sedimentary organic matter change conformation, shrink in volume, and expose hydrophobic groups, thus becoming more hydrophobic. In environments with wet and dry cycles. the distribution of hydrophobic or hydrophilic compounds between solution and particulate phases could thus be influenced by the 3D structure and polarity of organic matter.

AB  - Coastal marshes accrete vertically in response to sea-level rise and subsidence. Inadequate accretion and subsequent conversion of coastal marshes to open water generally is attributed to inadequate mineral sedimentation because mineral sedimentation is widely assumed to control accretion. Using Cs-137 dating to determine vertical accretion, mineral sedimentation, and organic matter accumulation, we found that accretion varied with organic accumulation rather than mineral sedimentation across a wide range of conditions in coastal Louisiana, including stable marshes where soil was 80% mineral matter. These results agreed with previous research, but no mechanism had been proposed to explain accretion via vegetative growth. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we found that flooding stimulated root growth above the marsh surface. These results indicated the need for additional work to determine if flooding controls accretion in some marshes by stimulating root growth on the marsh surface, rather than by mineral accumulation on the marsh surface. Restoration or management that focus on mineral sedimentation may be ineffective where a relationship between accretion and mineral sedimentation is assumed rather than tested. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Salt marshes are decreasing worldwide. Restoration projects address marsh loss, yet it remains unclear how well restored marshes grow, expand, and function in eutrophic waters. Here, we explored how a facultative mutualism between Atlantic ribbed mussels Geukensia demissa and cordgrass Spartina alterniflora may enhance marsh growth and nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic setting. We created experimental plots in Jamaica Bay, NY, that contained live mussels, mussel shells, or no mussels (control). After 9 wk, we measured sediment and plant characteristics. We also collected sediment cores for use in continuous flow-through incubations with ambient site water and water enriched with stable isotope-labeled nitrate ((NO3-)-N-15). Denitrification in marsh plots with live mussels was significantly higher than the other treatments. Live mussels likely enhanced denitrification as biodeposits increased sediment organic carbon and anaerobic conditions. Mussel treatments did not impact cordgrass growth, possibly due to the eutrophic conditions of our study system or the duration of our trials. Ribbed mussels may be a valuable addition for salt marsh restoration projects in eutrophic estuaries since they increase the ecosystem service of nitrogen removal. Future work should focus on long-term effects of ribbed mussels on nitrogen removal and cordgrass biomass in restored marshes to determine how the mutualism impacts restoration success as sites age.

AB  - Wetlands and tidal marshes in the Rhode River estuary of the Chesapeake Bay act as important sources of dissolved organic carbon and strongly absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) for adjacent estuarine waters. The effects of solar exposure on the photochemical degradation of colored DOM (CDOM) were examined for material derived from different sources (estuarine and freshwater parts of the Rhode River, sub-watershed stream, marshes) in this estuarine ecosystem. Consistent with changes in fluorescence emission, absorption loss upon exposure to different portions of the solar spectrum (i.e. different long-pass cut-off filters) occurred across the entire spectrum but the wavelength of maximum photobleaching decreased as the cut-off wavelength of the filter decreased. Our results illustrate that solar exposure can cause either an increase or a decrease in the CDOM absorption spectral slope, S-CDOM, depending on the spectral quality of irradiation and, thus, on the parameters (e.g. atmospheric composition, concentration of UV-absorbing water constituents) that affect the spectral characteristics of the light to which CDOM is exposed. We derived a simple spectral model for describing the effects of solar exposure on CDOM optical quality. The model accurately, and consistently, predicted the observed dependence of CDOM photobleaching on the spectral quality of solar exposure.

   The presented results indicate that throughout the year a dominant refractory fraction is present in the seston, but that seasonal additions can be distinguished, Apart from this seasonal pattern, differences between ebb and flood can be visualized by the use of discriminant analysis. During summertime, flood seston is enriched with lipids and recently synthesized polysaccharides, while during the rest of the year the flood tide samples contain more (remains of) lignin and polysaccharides than their ebb tide counterparts, The lignin markers comprise only fragments with extremely altered (reduced) character,
   These results, which highlight the molecular composition of the exchanged seston but do not offer exact quantitative budget estimations, provide no evidence for export of lignin-rich particulate halophytic material from the marsh to the water system. On the contrary, based on seston compositions, the water system seems to supply lignin-rich particles to the marsh during a considerable part of the year.

AB  - Sediment deposition in tidal wetlands is a critical process that determines whether vertical growth will keep pace with sea-level rise. However, more information is needed on how sediment deposition varies spatially and temporally across wetlands, including the effects of elevation, tidal inundation, vegetation, and weather. We investigated variation in sediment deposition due to season, distance from channel, channel size, and vegetation composition at low and high salinity tidal marshes in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary, California using sediment traps deployed monthly between December 2015 and November 2016. Over the course of the year, sediment deposition ranged widely (1.4 - 174.0 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) and averaged 19.5 +/- 3.5 kg m(-2) yr(-1). Deposition increased with flooding duration, decreased with increasing distance from channels, and was highest during the spring and early summer. Higher wind speeds during the spring may have driven re-suspension from mudflats, promoting deposition. Ratios of organic-to-mineral deposition were twice as high at the fresher site and were correlated with differences in vegetation composition between sites. Our results suggest that seasonality, distance from sediment source, salinity regime, and channel size are important sources of spatiotemporal variation in deposition. These results are relevant to accretion sampling and wetland restoration design.

AB  - Relationships between carbon (C) production and nitrogen (N) mineralization were investigated in two alpine wetland soils of the Tibetan Plateau using laboratory incubation under different temperatures (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and water saturation (noninundation and inundation). A significant positive relationship was found between CO2 production and N mineralization under increasing temperatures from 5 to 35 degrees C with the same water saturation condition in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.491 P < 0.0001) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.38, P < 0.002), and a negative relationship with water saturation increasing at the same temperature, especially 25 and 35 degrees C, in the marsh soil (r(2) > 0.70, P < 0.009) and the peat soil (r(2) > 0.61: P < 0.013). In conclusion, temperatures and water saturation could regulate the relationship between CO2 production and net N mineralization in the Tibetan alpine marsh and peat soils.

TI  - Estimating the contribution of Spartina anglica biomass to salt-marsh sediments using compound specific stable carbon isotope measurements
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - Compound specific delta(13)C analyses were used to determine the relative input of a C-4 temperate grass (Spartina anglica) to primary biomass in a salt-marsh sediment. Lipid distributions revealed a C-32 n-alkanol homologue as a characteristically dominant component of Spartina anglica whilst the cohabiting C-3 species, Puccinellia maritima, exhibited a C-26 maximum. The C-32 n-alkanol component was used to create an isotopic mixing model, between organic matter derived from Spartina anglica and Puccinellia maritima, to estimate their relative contribution to the primary biomass input of salt-marsh sediments. The application of sedimentary lipid isotope data to the model gave values of Spartina anglica contributions ranging from 37 to 100%. This investigation represents the first attempt to quantify inputs to sedimentary biomass based on compound specific stable carbon isotope techniques. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycling is important in determining ecosystem primary productivity and the succession of plant communities in coastal marshes. In order to examine the effects of biotic disturbances (i.e. vegetation change and crab burrowing) on N transformations, we conducted a field experiment in which crabs were either removed or left intact in three marsh types (bare flat, Phragmites australis marsh and Spartina alterniflora marsh) at Chongming Dongtan in the Yangtze River Estuary. The potential rates of soil gross nitrogen mineralization (GNM), gross ammonium immobilization (GAI), gross nitrification and gross nitrate consumption were determined using an ex situ incubation approach. Gross N mineralization was significantly lower in vegetated marshes than in the bare flat, probably because dissolved organic carbon (the main energy source for microbes) was lower in vegetated marshes. Less dissolved organic carbon in vegetated marshes may be attributable to high microbial demand for labile carbon relative to the supply of labile carbon in the rhizosphere. The presence of crabs increased the GAI:GNM ratio, indicating that crabs may increase the soil microbial demand for ammonium. Ammonium immobilization competed with nitrification for ammonium, and limited nitrification in crab-present plots. Furthermore, the lower nitrate production by nitrifies in crab-present plots resulted in lower rates of nitrate consumption. These results highlight the role of labile carbon and N in mediating the effects of macrophyte and soil fauna on N transformations.

AB  - We examined benthic microbial communities in 3 contrasting subtidal salt marsh sediments over the course of a year to investigate the relationship between environmental conditions and benthic microbial community structure. Samples were collected monthly from a high-energy sandy beach, a tidal creek bed, and a Spartina alterniflora marsh border. The concentrations and biomasses of benthic microalgae (BMA), total and potentially active bacteria (measured by an enzyme-activated fluorogenic compound), heterotrophic protists, and metazoan meiofauna were measured at each location. Sediment grain size and porewater pH explained most of the variability in biomass distributions; variations in benthic biomass did not correlate well with temperature. There was a seasonal shift from a BMA-dominated community in the spring and summer months to bacteria-dominated communities in autumn at all locations, when inactive bacteria were most abundant. When normalized to sediment porewater volume, benthic protists concentrations were not significantly related to sediment porosity, Benthic protist porewater concentrations (mean: 3.4 x 10(3), range: 0.1 to 9.3 x 10(3) protists ml(-1)) were comparable to protist concentrations in the water column. In contrast, bacteria were several orders of magnitude more concentrated in the sediments (mean: 4.2 x 10(9); range: 0.6 to 16 x 10(9) bacteria ml-1) than the water column. Low abundances of protists relative to bacteria appear to contribute to long bacterial turnover times, especially in fine-grained sediments. We hypothesize that both grazing by meiofauna and low anaerobic growth efficiency lead to relatively low biomass of bacterivorous protists.

AB  - The Tagus estuary is a mesotidal estuary located on the Western Portuguese coast, and is characterized by large areas of salt marshes (17.24 km(2)) and tidal flats distributed along the margins. Halophyte vegetation in this system concentrates heavy metals during the growing season and subsequently releases these metals to the environment following senescence. Although there currently there are no metal discharges to the estuary, this was not true in the past, and there are still large amounts of legacy metals within the system. The results presented here show that marshes in the Tagus estuary, can export metal contaminants at the rate of 162 Zn kg m(2) y(-1), 26 Cu kg m(2) y(-1), 28 Pb kg m(2) y(-1) and 1 Cd kg m(2) y(-1). Eddies are generated inside the estuary during frequent flood events, enhancing erosion and transport of particles. During neap tide periods plant detritus is mostly retained in the inner estuary in the vicinity of the marsh source; during spring tides, however, export to the main channel and to the ocean is significantly increased. Sea level rise (SLR) and/or expected increase in the frequency of flood events will increase detrital movement within the estuary and discharges of metal contaminated particles to the ocean shelf. This research highlights the capacity of the present estuary to moderate fluxes of legacy metals to the ocean, but also calls for efforts to reduce present contaminant inputs from the watershed to mitigate contaminant transport to the ocean in the future.

AB  - Salt marshes play a key role in removing excess anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads to nearshore marine ecosystems through sediment microbial processes such as denitrification. However, in the Gulf of Mexico, the loss of marsh vegetation because of human-driven disturbances such as sea level rise and oil spills can potentially reduce marsh capacity for N removal. To investigate the effect of vegetation loss on ecosystem N removal, we contrasted denitrification capacity in marsh and subtidal sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill using a combination of N-29(2) and N-30(2) production (isotope pairing), denitrification potential measurements (acetylene block), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of functional genes in the denitrification pathway. We found that, on average, denitrification capacity was 4 times higher in vegetated sediments because of a combination of enhanced nitrification and higher organic carbon availability. The abundance of nirS-type denitrifers indicated that marsh vegetation regulates the activity, rather than the abundance, of denitrifier communities. We estimated that marsh sediments remove an average of 3.6 t N km(-2) y(-1) compared to 0.9 t N km(-2) y(-1) in unvegetated sediments. Overall, our findings indicate that marsh loss results in a substantial loss of N removal capacity in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The collection of high frequency water quality data are key to making the next leap in hydrological and biogeochemical sciences. Commercially available in situ ultraviolet-visual (UV-Vis) spectrometers make possible the long-term collection of absorption spectra multiple times per hour. This technology has proven useful for measuring nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and total suspended solids in many environments, but has not been tested in tidal marsh conditions where upstream freshwater mixes with estuarine waters, resulting in rapid changes in concentrations and salinity. These three parameters encompass only a portion of the nutrients that are of interest in these systems. To test the potential of spectroscopy to measure these and other nutrient concentrations, spectrometers were installed in a constructed brackish tidal marsh and absorbance spectra were compared to lab analyses for coinciding discrete samples. Variable selection techniques, including partial least squares regression, lasso regression, and stepwise regression, were used to develop models with which nitrate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, phosphate, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, and salinity in brackish marsh waters can be predicted from UV-Vis spectrometer measurements. Significant relationships between the absorption spectra and the laboratory measured concentrations were observed for all of the parameters. Phosphate and total phosphorus were the only nutrients which had R-2 values less than 0.86 for their best calibrations. This study shows the potential to collect multiple water quality parameters at a high frequency in brackish waters using in situ spectrometers and gives the tools to replicate this analysis in all environments.

AB  - Efficient and sustainable management of rapidly mounting environmental issues has been the focus of current intensive research. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of plant phenological development stage variation on mercury (Hg) tolerance, accumulation, and allocation in two salt marsh macrophytes Triglochin maritima and Scirpus maritimus prevalent in historically Hg-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stands of T. maritima and S. maritimus were collected from reference (R) and sites with moderate (M) and high (H) Hg contamination in Laranjo bay within Ria de Aveiro lagoon. Hg tolerance, uptake, and allocation in T. maritima and S. maritimus, physico-chemical traits (pH, redox potential, and organic matter content) and Hg concentrations in sediments vegetated by these species were impacted differentially by phenological development stages variation irrespective of the Hg contamination level. In T. maritima, Hg concentration increased with increase in Hg contamination gradient where root displayed significantly higher Hg followed by rhizome and leaf maximally at H. However, in S. maritimus, the highest Hg concentration was perceptible in rhizome followed by root maximally at M. Between the two studied plant species, S. maritimus displayed higher Hg tolerance index (depicted by higher plant dry mass allocated to reproductive stage) and higher available Hg at M (during all growth stages) and H (during senescent stage) when compared to T. maritimus. Both plant species proved to be Hg excluder (low root/rhizome-leaf Hg translocation). Additionally, T. maritima also acted as Hg stabilizer while, S. maritimus as Hg accumulator. It can be inferred from the study that (a) the plant phenological development stage variations significantly influenced plant Hg sensitivity by impacting sediment chemistry, plant growth (in terms of plant dry mass), Hg accumulation, and its subsequent allocation capacity, contingent to Hg contamination gradient; (b) S. maritimus accumulated higher Hg but restricted its translocation to above-ground part using exclusion process at both M and H due to its accelerated growth during Hg-tolerant reproductive/metabolically active phenological development stage greater than its counterpart T. maritima; and (c) the studied salt marsh plants although hailed from the same C3 and monocot group did not necessarily display similar phenotypic plasticity and behavior towards Hg-contaminated scenario during their life cycle.

AB  - Background: Early diagenetic processes involved in natural organic matter ( NOM) oxidation in marine sediments have been for the most part characterized after collecting sediment cores and extracting porewaters. These techniques have proven useful for deep-sea sediments where biogeochemical processes are limited to aerobic respiration, denitrification, and manganese reduction and span over several centimeters. In coastal marine sediments, however, the concentration of NOM is so high that the spatial resolution needed to characterize these processes cannot be achieved with conventional sampling techniques. In addition, coastal sediments are influenced by tidal forcing that likely affects the processes involved in carbon oxidation.
   Results: In this study, we used in situ voltammetry to determine the role of tidal forcing on early diagenetic processes in intertidal salt marsh sediments. We compare ex situ measurements collected seasonally, in situ profiling measurements, and in situ time series collected at several depths in the sediment during tidal cycles at two distinct stations, a small perennial creek and a mud flat. Our results indicate that the tides coupled to the salt marsh topography drastically influence the distribution of redox geochemical species and may be responsible for local differences noted year-round in the same sediments. Monitoring wells deployed to observe the effects of the tides on the vertical component of porewater transport reveal that creek sediments, because of their confinements, are exposed to much higher hydrostatic pressure gradients than mud flats.
   Conclusion: Our study indicates that iron reduction can be sustained in intertidal creek sediments by a combination of physical forcing and chemical oxidation, while intertidal mud flat sediments are mainly subject to sulfate reduction. These processes likely allow microbial iron reduction to be an important terminal electron accepting process in intertidal coastal sediments.

AB  - 3-Mercaptopropionate (3-MPA) is a major hydrophilic thiol in salt marsh sediments from Shelter island, New York. It is associated mainly with the sedimentary particulate phase, although the mechanism of its binding has not been clear. In this study, we show that humic substances coated on clay minerals are involved in binding 3-MPA through di- and poly-sulfide linkages. With increasing depth, the abundance of 3-MPA in the fulvic acid fraction decreases with a concomitant increase in the humic acid fraction, suggesting that, with depth, fulvic-bound 3-MPA is converted into humic-bound 3-MPA. We modeled the depth variation with a multi-G model which suggests that there are two types of reactive components in both fulvic acid-bound and humic acid-bound 3-MPA, one changing about 10 times more rapidly than the other. These two 3-MPA pools probably reflect different types of sulfur bridging, with the polysulfide-bridged pool changing more rapidly than the disulfide-bridged pool. As free thiol, 3-MPA is attacked relatively rapidly by anaerobic bacteria, its degradation following first-order kinetics. However, in the sediment core we studied, humic-bound 3-MPA was present throughout the sediment column, down to 22 cm, corresponding to an age of about 90 years. These results suggest that thiols can escape bacterial degradation in sediments by binding to humic substances. The sedimentary distribution of 3-MPA is an important illustration of the interplay of biological and chemical processes in the fate of thiols in anoxic marine sediments.

AB  - We used Cs-137-dating to determine vertical accretion rates of 15 salt marshes on the Bay of Fundy, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Accretion rates are compared to a number of factors assumed to influence vertical marsh accretion: rates of relative sea-level rise, climatic parameters (average daily temperatures and degree days) and latitude (related to insolation and day length), sediment characteristics (organic matter inventory, bulk, mineral, and organic matter density), distance of the core site from the nearest source of tidal waters, and the tidal range. Unique to our study is a consideration of climatic parameters and latitude, which should influence organic matter production, and thus vertical accretion rates. Significant predictors of accretion rates (in order of importance) were found to be organic matter inventory, distance from a creek, and range of mean tides. Contrary to conclusions from previous studies, we found that accretion rates decreased with increasing tidal range, probably because we considered a wider span of tidal ranges, from micro- to macrotidal. Although four marshes with low organic matter inventories also show a deficit in accretion with respect to relative sea-level rise, organic matter is not limiting in two-thirds of the marshes studied, despite shorter growing seasons.

AB  - Although estuarine tidal marshes are important contributors to the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) emission, and environmental factors, with respect to estuarine marshes, has not been clarified thoroughly. This study investigated the crucial factors controlling the emission of CO2 and CH4 from a freshwater marsh and a brackish marsh located in a subtropical estuary in southeastern China, as well as their magnitude. The duration of the study period was November 2013 to October 2014. Relevant to both the field and incubation experiments, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from the two marshes showed pronounced seasonal variations. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from both marshes demonstrated significant positive correlations with the air/soil temperature (p < 0.01), but negative correlations with the soil electrical conductivity and the pore water/tide water Cl- and SO42- (p < 0.01). The results indicate no significant difference in the CO2 emissions between the freshwater and brackish marshes in the subtropical estuary, whereas there was a difference in the CH4 emissions between the two sites (p < 0.01). Although future sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion could reduce the CH4 emissions from the estuarine freshwater marshes, these factors had little effect on the CO2 emissions with respect to an increase in salinity of less than 5%. The findings of this study could have important implications for estimating the global warming contributions of estuarine marshes along differing salinity gradients.

AB  - An assessment of heavy metal concentrations was performed on two sheltered littoral locations on the north-west coast of Ireland, encompassing the tidal flat, eroded tidal marsh edge and backmarsh/supratidal settings. Both sites possess catchments devoid of major industries, allowing an indication of regional pollution levels to be approximated. Profiles of heavy metal concentrations were interpreted by considering diagenetic effects, with conclusions supported by grain size and organic carbon determinations, An increase in heavy metal concentrations landwards was observed, resultant upon increased organic components in the sediment and a dominance of metal-humic complexes. Concentrations of lead, copper, zinc, chromium and manganese were found to be relatively low for both sites, although an increase in anthropogenic input in recent sediments was implied. Both sites were also dated radiometrically. The dates calculated helped to show that the tidal marshes of north-western Ireland have not yet been anthropogenically modified to the point of toxicity.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems provide a number of life-sustaining services, from which benefits to humans can be derived. They are often inhabited by aquatic vegetation, such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes. Given their wide geographic distribution and coverage, there is need to prioritize conservation efforts. An understanding of the human importance of these ecosystems can help with that prioritization. Here, we summarize a literature review of ecosystem service valuation studies. We discuss (1) the degree to which current valuation information is sufficient to prioritize blue carbon habitat conservation and restoration, (2) the relevancy of available studies, and (3) what is missing from the literature that would be needed to effectively prioritize conservation. Given the recent focus on blue carbon ecosystems in the international conservation, there are a number of areas where research on blue forest ecosystem assessment and valuation could be improved, from enhancing available methodologies to increasing valuation of rarely studied ecosystem services and wider geographic coverage of valuation studies. This review highlights these gaps and calls for a focus on broadening the ecosystem services that are valued, the methods used, and increasing valuation in underrepresented regions.

AB  - Stratigraphic records from sediment cores collected in a freshwater tidal marsh and in the estuary up stream and downstream from the marsh were used to determine the accumulation of nutrients and trace metals over long time periods. Analysis of pollen and seeds show that the high marsh has formed only within the past 100 yr, following increased sedimentation rates in the area. Variations in nutrient and trace metal accumulations over several decades show that pollutants from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge are stored to a greater extent in high-marsh than in low-marsh sediments. Greater accumulation rates in the high marsh are probably related to its greater sedimentary organic carbon concentration.

AB  - We used a GIS-based approach to examine the influence of road density and physical watershed features (watershed size, wetland cover, and bedrock type) on water quality in coastal marshes of Georgian Bay, Ontario. We created a GIS that included landscape information and water-quality data from a 9-year synoptic survey of 105 coastal marshes covering 28 quaternary watersheds. Multiple regressions and partial correlations were used to discern confounding effects of human-induced (road density) versus natural physical watershed determinants of water quality. Road density was the dominant factor influencing many water quality variables, showing positive correlations with specific conductivity (COND), total suspended solids (TSS), and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) and a negative correlation with overall Water Quality Index scores. Road density also showed positive correlations with total nitrate nitrogen (TNN) and total phosphorus (TP). By comparison, larger watershed area was the main factor leading to elevated TP concentrations. The proportion of the watershed occupied by wetlands explained the largest amount of variation in TNN concentrations (negative correlation) and was also negatively correlated with COND and positively correlated with TSS and ISS when we controlled for road density. Bedrock type did not have a significant effect in any of the models. Our findings suggest that road density is currently the overriding factor governing water quality of coastal marshes in Georgian Bay during the summer low-flow period. We recommend that natural variation in physical watershed characteristics be considered when developing water quality standards and management practices for freshwater coastal areas.

AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) were quantified in sediments from two sites in southeastern Louisiana in a 14 d microcosm study using Palaemonetes pugio and Rangia cuneata and two radiolabeled PAHs, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene (b[a]p). For both PAHs studied, mean BSAFs were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in both organisms in sediments from Bayou Trepagnier (BSAF = 0.628 g OC g TLE-1), a brackish swamp, compared to Pass Fourchon (0.065 g OC g TLE-1), a coastal salt marsh. In order to explain observed patterns in BSAFs, organic carbon-normalized PAH distribution coefficients between the sediment and freely dissolved phases (K-OC)(OBS) were determined as well as the various geochemical variables of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM, respectively). These included analyses of particle surface area, total organic carbon (TOC), carbon to nitrogen ratios (C:N), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Bayou Trepagnier was higher in surface area, TOC, C:N, as well as DOC suggesting that the difference in BSAFs may be attributed to compositional differences in POM and DOM between sites. We can not exclude the possibility that other factors (such as differences in organism behavior resulting from contrasting sediment characteristics) were responsible for BSAFs varying between the two sites. Phenanthrene BSAFs were typically higher than b[a]p BSAFs, suggesting contaminants were limited in their desorption from sediment particles as a function of PAH molecular weight. Mean BSAFs for both PAHs were higher on Day 7 than on Day 14. The reason for this decrease is unclear, but did not appear to be due to organisms becoming increasingly stressed in the microcosms. Visual observations indicated that animals remained feeding while no decreases in organism total lipid levels were detected. The trends in BSAFs between sites and over the time course of this experiment suggest that contaminant bioaccumulation in estuarine systems should not be considered to be an equilibrium process.

AB  - The role of tidal marshes as a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for adjacent estuarine waters was studied in the Rhode River subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay. Water in a tidal creek draining brackish, high-elevation marshes was sampled every hour during several semidiurnal tidal cycles in order to examine the tidal exchange of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Water leaving the marsh during ebbing tide was consistently enriched in DOC compared to water entering the marsh during flooding tide. There was a net DOC export from the marsh to the estuary during seasons of both low and high marsh plant biomass. Optical analysis demonstrated that, in addition to contributing to the carbon budgets, the marsh had a strong influence on the estuary's CDOM dynamics. Marsh-exported CDOM had optical properties that were consistently and markedly different from those of CDOM in the adjacent estuary. Specifically, marsh CDOM had: (1) considerably stronger absorption, (2) larger DOC-specific absorption, (3) lower exponential spectral slope, (4) larger fluorescence signal, (5) lower fluorescence per unit absorbance, and (6) higher fluorescence at wavelengths >400 nm. These optical characteristics are indicative of relatively complex, high-molecular-weight, aromatic-rich DOM, and this was confirmed by results of molecular-weight-distribution analysis. Our findings illustrate the importance of tidal marshes as sources of optically and chemically distinctive dissolved organic compounds, and their influence on CDOM dynamics, DOC budgets, and, thus, photochemical and biogeochemical processes, in adjacent estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - Restored salt marshes frequently lack the full range of plant communities present on reference marshes, with upper marsh species underrepresented. This often results from sites being too low in the tidal frame and/or poorly drained with anoxic sediments. A managed coastal realignment scheme at Abbotts Hall, Essex, UK, has oxic sediments at elevations at which upper marsh communities would be expected. But 7 years after flooding, it continued to be dominated by pioneer communities, with substantial proportions of bare ground, so other factors must hinder vegetation development at these elevations. The poorly vegetated areas had high sediment shear strength, low water and organic carbon content and very flat topography. These characteristics occur frequently on the upper parts of created marshes. Experimental work is required to establish causal links with the ecological differences, but other studies have also reported that reduced plant beta-diversity and lower usage by fish are associated with topographic uniformity. Uniformity also leads to very different visual appearance from natural marshes. On the upper intertidal, sediment deposition rate are slow, water velocities are low and erosive forces are weak. So, topographic heterogeneity cannot develop naturally, even if creeks have been excavated. Without active management, these conditions will persist indefinitely.

AB  - The nereid polychaete Hediste diversicolor was frequently used as biomonitor of heavy metals contamination in estuaries. In the present work, the bioaccumulation of five heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb) in tissues of H. diversicolor collected from six salt marshes in the lagoon of Venice is studied by analysing the relationships between concentrations of the operationally-defined reactive fraction of trace metals in sediments and total concentrations in tissues. The characterisation of sediment samples shows a clear distinction between sites near and far from the Industrial Zone; no analogous pattern is observed for tissue concentrations suggesting that metal bioaccumulation is controlled by complex interactions between metal bioavailability and physiological factors. Considering relationships between metals, strong inverse correlations are observed in polychaetes and sediments for Cu and Cr concentrations suggesting a possible interaction between these two metals. The role played by organic matter (OM) in the availability of metal is highlighted considering inverse relationships found between bioaccumulation factors for Cu, Cr, Cd and OM.

AB  - Spatial distribution patterns of Scirpus validus were studied in tidal marshes of the lower Savannah River.  The hypothesis that changes in spatial pattern for S. validus would accompany differences in environmental parameters was tested by sampling densities and biomass along environmental gradients of salinity and elevation.  Coefficients of dispersion were calculated for S. validus and used to compare spatial patterns among freshwater, mildly oligohaline, strongly oligohaline, and mesohaline tidal marshes.  Results indicated significantly greater clumping of S. validus in mesohaline marsh than in freshwater marsh.  Only the mildly oligohaline site supported a random population of S. validus, while the strongly oligohaline marsh supported a uniform spatial distribution.  Spatial pattern and relative importance of S. validus, as well as composition of co-occurring species, changed significantly with changing salinity.  The relations between changes in relative importance of S. validus and differences in soil organic matter and elevation were also significant.

AB  - There is growing evidence for a tight linkage between the structure and function of microbial communities and for the importance of this relationship in ecosystem responses to disturbances such as sea-level rise (SLR). While the role of plants in determining the capacity of salt marshes to keep pace with SLR through sediment accretion has received considerable attention, the role of microbes in offsetting these gains via decomposition is less understood.
   We conducted a controlled experiment to determine the structural and functional responses of microbes to SLR, using soil from the low intertidal zone of two New England salt marshes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, USA. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (t-RFLPs) generated from microbial 16S rDNA to evaluate community composition and diversity and focused on changes in respiration with SLR, measured as total respired carbon normalized by percent organic matter, as a surrogate for decomposition rate.
   We observed a 24% reduction in microbial respiration with a simulated rise in sea level of 40 cm. This functional change was accompanied by a structural shift in microbial community composition among samples from New Hampshire but not Massachusetts, assessed via principal coordinate analysis of t-RFLP data. We also found greater microbial diversity within our New Hampshire samples, suggesting that low diversity may constrain community compositional shifts.
   Our results suggest that decreased microbial respiration could alleviate the negative effects of SLR on salt marsh surface elevation, at least in the short term, and that the diversity of the soil microbial community may positively influence functional responses such as respiration.

AB  - Induced polarization (IP) measurements (0.1-1000 Hz) were conducted on seventeen clay and peat marsh soils that were subsequently analyzed for heavy metal concentrations, moisture content, organic matter, porosity, specific surface area, and pore fluid conductivity. A Cole-Cole model was fit to each sample and model parameters analyzed in terms of physicochemical properties. We found a linear relation between the normalized chargeability (m(n)) and estimated surface area to pore volume (S.) when iron content (ranging from 0.25% to 1.63% by volume) is accounted for as a polarizable element of the soil. In fact, the dependence of m(n) on volumetric Fe concentration per unit volume of the bulk soil is described by a linear relationship with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.94. As Fe concentration is a critical biogeochemical parameter, our findings suggest that IP measurements may provide a hitherto unrecognized approach to probing soil geochemistry, iron cycling and anaerobic microbial activity. Furthermore, our results yield insights into physicochemical controls on IP in natural soils.

AB  - We measured fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) simultaneously in two typical fringing zones, sandy shore and salt marsh, of coastal lagoon, Lake Nakaumi, Japan, in mid-summer 2003. Our aim was to quantify net the greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes and examine key factors, which control variation of the GHGs fluxes in the two sites. Net CO2 and CH4 fluxes were markedly different between the two sites; magnitudes and variations of the both fluxes in sandy shore were lower than those of salt marsh. Meanwhile, magnitude and variation of net N2O flux in the two sites were similar. In sandy shore, temporal and spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were highly controlled by water level fluctuation derived from astronomic tide. In salt marsh, spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were correlated with aboveground biomass, and temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were correlated with soil temperature. The sum of global warming potential, which was roughly estimated using the observed GHGs fluxes, was ca. 174-fold higher in salt marsh than in sandy shore. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem recovery following wetland restoration offers exceptional opportunities to study system structure, function, and successional processes in salt marshes. This study used observations of natural variation and large-scale manipulative experiments to test the influence of vascular vegetation and soil organic matter on the rate and trajectory of macrofaunal recovery in a southern California created salt marsh, the Crown Point Mitigation Site. During the first three years following marsh establishment, macrofaunal density and species richness recovered rapidly within the Spartina foliosa (cordgrass) zone; densities in the created marsh were 50% of those in the natural marsh after 16 mo and 97% after 28 mo. However, the early successional assemblage had a lower proportion of tubificid and enchytraeid oligochaetes, and a higher proportion of chironomids and other insect larvae than did the mature natural marsh. Most of the colonizers arrived by rafting on sea grass and algae rather than by larval dispersal. Initial planting of S. foliosa had no influence on macrofaunal recovery, perhaps because of variable transplant survival. However, subsequently, both positive and negative correlations were observed between densities of some macrofaunal taxa and shoot densities of S. foliosa or Salicornia spp. (pickleweed). Salinity and measures of soil organics (belowground biomass, combustible organic matter, and chlorophyll a) also were correlated with macrofaunal densities and taxon richness. Of foul added soil amendments (kelp, alfalfa, peat, and Milorganite), Milorganite (a sewage product) and kelp both promoted macrofaunal colonization during year 1, but effects were short lived. The most significant sources of heterogeneity in the recovering marsh were associated with site history and climate variation. Faunal recovery was most rapid in highly localized, organic-rich marsh sediments that were remnants of the historical wetland. Elevated sea level during the 1998 El Nino corresponded with similarity of macrofaunal communities in the created and natural marshes. The large spatial scale and multi-year duration of this study revealed that natural sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity may exert stronger influence on faunal succession in California wetlands than manipulation of vegetation or soil properties.

AB  - In addition to their being vital components of mid-to high-latitude coastal ecosystems, salt marshes contain 0.1% of global sequestered terrestrial carbon. Their sustainability is now threatened by accelerating sea-level rise (SLR) that has reached a rate that is many times greater than the rate at which they formed and evolved. Modeling studies have been instrumental in predicting how marsh systems will respond to greater frequencies and durations of tidal inundation and in quantifying thresholds when marshes will succumb and begin to disintegrate due to accelerating SLR. Over the short term, some researchers believe that biogeomorphic feedbacks will improve marsh survival through greater biomass productivity enhanced by warmer temperatures and higher carbon dioxide concentrations. Increased sedimentation rates are less likely due to lower-than-expected suspended sediment concentrations. The majority of marsh loss today is through wave-induced edge erosion that beneficially adds sediment to the system. Edge erosion is partly offset by upland marsh migration during SLR.
   Despite positive biogeomorphic feedbacks, many salt marshes will succumb to accelerating sea-level rise due to insufficient mineral sediment.
   The latest multivariate marsh modeling is producing predictions of marsh evolution under various sea-level rise scenarios.
   The least well-known variables in projecting changes to salt marshes are suspended sediment concentrations and net sediment influx to the marsh.
   We are in the infancy of understanding the importance and processes of marsh edge erosion and the overall dynamicism of marshes.
   This review defines the latest breakthroughs in understanding the response of salt marshes to accelerating sea-level rise and decreasing sediment supply.
   Climate change is accelerating sea-level rise, warming temperatures, and increasing carbon dioxide, all of which are impacting marsh vegetation and vertical accretion.

AB  - Dynamics of reclaimed coastal wetland soils under cultivation has not been well understood, especially at temporal scales longer than a century. In this study, we analyzed major chemical properties of plow-layer soils extensively sampled under two cropping systems (paddy rice vs. upland cropping) along a 500-year soil chronosequence created by intermittent reclamation of coastal salt marshes. The results suggested a rapid desalinization of soil immediately after reclamation. During 500 years of cultivation, the decalcification process lowered soil pH from >8 to nearly neutral. Soil organic carbon (SOC) contents markedly declined in the initial 16 years, but then rapidly recovered within 30 years and thereafter slowly accumulated with cultivation duration. Meanwhile, the recalcitrance of SOC increased. Soil nutrient status was enhanced after centuries of cultivation as indicated by the improved total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorous (TP). Amorphous Fe oxyhydrates progressively decreased, but the crystallinity of Fe oxyhydrates increased with cultivation time. Cropping system greatly affected plow-layer soil properties, with paddy soils having higher SOC. MBC, NH4OAc-extractable Ca2+, but lower TP, NH4OAc-extractable K, potentially mineralizable nitrogen and Fe crystallinity than upland soils. Most soil properties revealed clear temporal patterns with more remarkable changes occurring in the first several decades after reclamation than in the following centuries. In conclusion, there was a transition phase of the soil system within the first several decades after reclamation of coastal wetlands, possibly harmful to agricultural production, but centuries of cultivation seemed to have significantly improved overall soil fertility.

AB  - When non-native primary producers become successful, the structure and function of native detrital food webs can be fundamentally altered. Salt marsh estuaries of the southeastern USA are in part detritus-based ecosystems and rely on the annual production of detritus from a single native species, the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Over the last several decades, the success of a novel primary producer, the red macroalga Agarophyton vermiculophyllum (formerly Gracilaria vermiculophylla), in a system historically devoid of macroalgae provides the opportunity to measure the effect of non-native basal resources on native detrital pathways. We conducted 2 in situ experiments to compare (1) decomposition rates of A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora and (2) invertebrate colonization rates onto dead A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora. Relative to S. alterniflora, we found that A. vermiculophyllum decomposes more rapidly, losing 80% or more of its biomass within 3 wk, while S. alterniflora lost similar to 50%. Experimental litterbags with decomposed A. vermiculophyllum and S. alterniflora harbored similar highly abundant invertebrate communities that differed greatly from denuded areas. Our results demonstrate that A. vermiculophyllum provides a complementary source of labile organic matter relative to S. alterniflora, boosting the amount of food and available habitat for small invertebrates of intertidal salt marshes and mudflats. Thus, non-native macrophytes may differentially affect community and ecosystem properties just as much when dead as alive, especially when they are biologically distinct from native species.

AB  - Polluted sediments in rivers may be transported by the river to the sea, spread over river banks and tidal marshes or managed, i.e. actively dredged and disposed of on land. Once sedimented on tidal marshes, alluvial areas or control flood areas, the polluted sediments enter semi-terrestrial ecosystems or agro-ecosystems and may pose a risk. Disposal of polluted dredged sediments on land may also lead to certain risks. Up to a few years ago, contaminated dredged sediments were placed in confined disposal facilities. The European policy encourages sediment valorisation and this will be a technological challenge for the near future. Currently, contaminated dredged sediments are often not valorisable due to their high content of contaminants and their consequent hazardous properties. In addition, it is generally admitted that treatment and re-use of heavily contaminated dredged sediments is not a cost-effective alternative to confined disposal. For contaminated sediments and associated disposal facilities used in the past, a realistic, low cost, safe, ecologically sound and sustainable management option is required. In this context, phytoremediation is proposed in the literature as a management option. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge on management, (phyto)remediation and associated risks in the particular case of sediments contaminated with organic and inorganic pollutants.
   This paper deals with the following features: (1) management and remediation of contaminated sediments and associated risk assessment; (2) management options for ecosystems on polluted sediments, based on phytoremediation of contaminated sediments with focus on phytoextraction, phytostabilisation and phytoremediation of organic pollutants and (3) microbial and mycorrhizal processes occurring in contaminated sediments during phytoremediation.
   In this review, an overview is given of phytoremediation as a management option for semi-terrestrial and terrestrial ecosystems affected by polluted sediments, and the processes affecting pollutant bioavailability in the sediments. Studies that combine contaminated sediment and phytoremediation are relatively recent and are increasing in number since few years. Several papers suggest including phytoremediation in a management scheme for contaminated dredged sediments and state that phytoremediation can contribute to the revaluation of land-disposed contaminated sediments. The status of sediments, i.e. reduced or oxidised, highly influences contaminant mobility, its (eco)toxicity and the success of phytoremediation. Studies are performed either on near-fresh sediment or on sediment-derived soil. Field studies show temporal negative effects on plant growth due to oxidation and subsequent ageing of contaminated sediments disposed on land. The review shows that a large variety of plants and trees are able to colonise or develop on contaminated dredged sediment in particular conditions or events (e.g. high level of organic matter, clay and moisture content, flooding, seasonal hydrological variations). Depending on the studies, trees, high-biomass crop species and graminaceous species could be used to degrade organic pollutants, to extract or to stabilise inorganic pollutants. Water content of sediment is a limiting factor for mycorrhizal development. In sediment, specific bacteria may enhance the mobilisation of inorganic contaminants whereas others may participate in their immobilisation. Bacteria are also able to degrade organic pollutants. Their actions may be increased in the presence of plants.
   Choice of plants is particularly crucial for phytoremediation success on contaminated sediments. Extremely few studies are long-term field-based studies. Short-term effects and resilience of ecosystems is observed in long-term studies, i.e. due to degradation and stabilisation of pollutants. Terrestrial ecosystems affected by polluted sediments range from riverine tidal marshes with several interacting processes and vegetation development mainly determined by hydrology, over alluvial soils affected by overbank sedimentation (including flood control areas), to dredged sediment disposal facilities where hydrology and vegetation might be affected or managed by human intervention. This gradient is also a gradient of systems with highly variable soil and hydrological conditions in a temporal scale (tidal marshes) versus systems with a distinct soil development over time (dredged sediment landfill sites).
   In some circumstances (e.g. to avoid flooding or to ensure navigation) dredging operations are necessary. Management and remediation of contaminated sediments are necessary to reduce the ecological risks and risks associated with food chain contamination and leaching. Besides disposal, classical remediation technologies for contaminated sediment also extract or destroy contaminants. These techniques imply the sediment structure deterioration and prohibitive costs. On the contrary, phytoremediation could be a low-cost option, particularly suited to in situ remediation of large sites and environmentally friendly. However, phytoremediation is rarely included in the management scheme of contaminated sediment and accepted as a viable option.
   Phytoremediation is still an emerging technology that has to prove its sustainability at field scale. Research needs to focus on optimisations to enhance applicability and to address the economic feasibility of phytoremediation.

AB  - Despite the importance of tidal ecosystems in the global carbon budget, the relationships between environmental drivers and carbon dynamics in these wetlands remain poorly understood. This limited understanding results from the challenges associated with in situ flux studies and their correlation with satellite imagery which can be affected by periodic tidal flooding. Carbon dioxide eddy covariance (EC) towers are installed in only a few wetlands worldwide, and the longest eddy-covariance record from Georgia (GA) wetlands contains only two continuous years of observations. The goals of the present study were to evaluate the performance of existing MODIS Gross Primary Production (GPP) products (MOD17A2) against EC derived GPP and develop a tide-robust Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) based model to predict GPP within a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh on Sapelo Island, GA. These EC tower-based observations represent a basis to associate CO2 fluxes with canopy reflectance and thus provide the means to use satellite-based reflectance data for broader scale investigations. We demonstrate that Light Use Efficiency (LUE)-based MOD17A2 does not accurately reflect tidal wetland GPP compared to a simple empirical vegetation index-based model where tidal influence was accounted for. The NDMI-based GPP model was capable of predicting changes in wetland CO2 fluxes and explained 46% of the variation in flux-estimated GPP within the training data, and a root mean square error of 6.96 g C m(-2) in the validation data. Our investigation is the first to create a MODIS-based wetland GPP estimation procedure that demonstrates the importance of filtering tidal observations from satellite surface reflectance data.

AB  - Hydrocarbons increase abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms, but also decrease microbial diversity. This could disrupt ecosystem dynamics by altering soil organic matter mineralization and resultant nutrient remineralization rates. Crude oil, which is known to contain toxins and reduce microbial diversity, was hypothesized to reduce gross metabolic activity of mixed microbial populations in wetland soils. Soil respiration and Eh were compared, for 6 months, among microcosms containing marsh soils that differed in soil organic matter (Panicum hemitomon Shult. or Sagittaria lancifolia L. dominated marshes), crude oil (Arabian crude, Louisiana crude, or no oil), and additives (a cleaner, a dispersant, fertilizer, or no additive). No treatment slowed activity; instead, Louisiana plus fertilizer and all Arabian treatments temporarily accelerated activity. Additional C respired from oiled microcosms exceeded C added as crude oil by 1.4 to 3.5 times. Thus, much additional C originated from soil organic matter rather than crude oil. Crude oils temporarily lowered soil Eh, which is consistent with accelerated metabolism and demand for electron accepters. The lack of inhibition observed at the community level does not necessarily indicate an absence of toxicity. Instead, tolerant species with metabolic versatility probably maintained activity. Stimulation probably resulted from removal of micronutrient limitation, rather than removal of grazing pressure or macronutrient limitation. Regardless, accelerated soil organic matter mineralization surely accelerated nutrient remineralization. This might explain some reports of crude oil stimulating plant growth. These results are not inconsistent with theoretical and experimental conclusions regarding effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability and productivity, nor are they inconsistent with conclusions that crude oils contain components that are toxic to microbes, vegetation, and fauna. However, these data do indicate that crude oils also contain components that temporarily stimulate metabolic activity of surviving microbes.

AB  - Large-scale agricultural land reclamation activities can trigger substantial changes in the soil bacterial community by disturbances associated with growth of crops and addition of fertilizers and pesticides. In this study, the bacterial 16S gene was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform for bacterial identification and taxonomy. We investigated the (i) soil bacterial diversity and community composition in natural marsh, moderate and severe intensity of interference in wetlands, and (ii) the relationship between soil physical and chemical properties, and soil bacterial community structures in order to understand the effects of interference intensities on the marsh soil environment in the Sanjiang Plain wetland, Northeast China. The natural marsh soil contained most of 573 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between all the three sites (n=1241), while wetland soils of moderate and severe intensity of interference had only 510 and 401 OTUs, respectively. The soil bacterial diversity and richness indices of all disturbed wetlands presented a decline at the OTU level, alpha diversity (Shannon diversity and Chao and Ace diversities). In addition, the composition of soil bacterial communities showed different trends and structure after the disturbance. There were significant variation in unclassified genera and some dominant genera (relative abundance>1% in at least one site) between natural marsh and difference in interference intensities in disturbed wetlands, including Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Chlorobi and Gemmatimonadetes. Composition of soil bacterial community was affected by Soil Moisture, pH, Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Available Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Available Phosphorus, Total Potassium, Nitrate Nitrogen, Available Potassium and Ammonium Nitrogen. This study will provide a fundamental scope to understand the bacterial community structure in wetland ecosystems and the environmental function as a predictor of bacterial community composition.

AB  - Wetland cultivation and its effects on soil properties in salt marshes in the Yellow River Delta, China were examined by using a combination of the satellite imageries and field experiments. Results showed that the conversions mainly occurred between dry lands and Phragmites australis-Suaeda salsa-Tamarix chinensis marshes (PSTMs). The total area of marsh wetland was reduced by 65.09 km(2) during the period from 1986 to 2005, and these conversions might be attributed to a combination of farming, oil exploration and water extraction, as well as soil salinization. Significant differences were observed in bulk density, pH, salinity and NO3--N between different land-use types (P < 0.05). After the conversions from marsh wetlands to dry lands, bulk density, pH, salinity and NH4+-N decreased slightly, while a significant increase in NO3--N. TN (total nitrogen), and AP (available phosphorus) (P < 0.05) was observed. The more loss of soil nutrient storage also occurred after the maximal area conversion from PSTMs to dry lands compared to other conversions during the study period. The storages of soil organic matter, NH4+-N and total phosphorus decreased greatly under the conversion from three types of marshes to dry lands, while those of NO3--N, AP and TN showed an obvious increase during the whole study period.

AB  - Wetlands are an important part of the global soil organic carbon pool and microorganisms play a pivotal role in carbon exchange between soils and atmosphere. Most wetland carbon studies have focused on boreal freshwater wetlands, especially peatlands. Less attention has been paid on the estuarine wetlands where variation in tide salinity can highly affect microbiology and carbon sequestration ability of the wetland soils. In this study, two representative estuarine wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary were chosen to determine the possible differences in microbial communities and activities between coastal (high salinity) and riparian (low salinity) zones of both wetlands. Over a 4-year period, the mean soil respiration of the coastal zones was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the riparian zones in each wetland. Soil respiration activities measured in laboratory as well as dehydrogenase activity were also lower in the coastal than in the riparian zones of the wetlands. The differences in the microbial activities could be a result of the differences in the microbial community structure. The riparian wetlands had e.g. more beta-Proteobacteria with strong heterotrophic metabolic activity than the coastal wetlands. Soil salinity correlated negatively to the abundance of beta-Proteobacteria and thus respiration. The riparian wetlands received approximately the same organic matter from plant biomass compared with the coastal wetlands but have lower soil carbon content than the coastal wetlands. This could be associated to the higher microbial decomposition capacity in soils with low salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Macrobenthos are a key constituent of coastal salt marsh ecosystems and have often been used as sensitive indicators of the environment quality. In this study, field investigations in vegetated regions and adjacent bare patches of low, middle and high marshes were conducted to explore whether and how vegetation influence the macrobenthos distribution in different saltmarsh zones along coastal topographic gradients. Results showed that vegetation positively or negatively influenced macrobenthos mainly by changing their environment in different saltmarsh zones, as there were different degrees of physical stresses and food supply for the macrobenthos from the low to the high marsh. In the low marsh, no major differences in macrobenthos indices between the bare and vegetated sediments were found, yet density and biomass of the molluscs were higher in the bare patches. In the middle marsh, vegetation promoted the biomass and diversity indices but not the density and species richness of the macrobenthos, and vegetation was beneficial for some types of crustaceans but was detrimental for some types of polychaetes. In the high marsh, vegetation promoted the biomass, density, and species richness of the macrobenthos compared to those of adjacent bare patches. Coastal topographic gradients also had effects on macrobenthos distribution consistently with different habitat preferences and ecological niches, and the low marsh had the highest species richness, Shannon diversity, Pielou evenness and Margalef richness. This study also provided scientific implications for the management and restoration of the ecosystems in different intertidal saltmarsh zones.

AB  - Complicated biogeochemical cycling and differential organic matter reactivity make quantifying the relative contribution of a given source of organic carbon to the standing stock within an estuary difficult. Here, a new model of tidal marsh-estuary organic carbon cycling is presented for the Rhode River, MD, a well-studied tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. A dissolved organic carbon (DOC) budget was estimated by summing the source and sink terms and the advection of water within the tributary. 13.1% and 15.3% of the total DOC input to the Rhode River entered from the marsh and the watershed, respectively, and 52.6% was derived from phytoplankton production. Extrapolating to the entire year, 35.5 Mg of DOC is exported to the main stem of Chesapeake Bay annually, which accounts for 12.3% of the total allochthonous and autochthonous inputs to the estuary. Removing the modeled marsh at the head of the Rhode River decreased export of DOC to the main stem by 39.2%, and up to 56% of the estuarine DOC standing stock can be attributed to the marsh. The model described here can be used across temperate estuarine systems and provides a new methodology for quantifying the amount of DOC that can be attributed to or lost by specific source and sink pathways.

AB  - While it has been demonstrated that microbial communities are influenced by plant species composition in upland systems, less is known about how estuarine vegetation may influence the structure and functional capabilities of sediment microbial communities. In this study, we adapted terrestrial catabolic response profile (CRP) methods for use under brackish anaerobic conditions. CRI's were employed to determine whether salt marsh vegetation had an effect on sediment microbial community function. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were utilized as a descriptor of microbial community structure. Samples were obtained from monospecific Spartina alterniffora and Phragmites australis plots located in disturbed and undisturbed estuarine salt marsh systems. In response to the addition of a range of 30 organic substrates we observed significant CO2 production in vegetated versus non-vegetated sediments from the undisturbed site. Vegetated sediments from the undisturbed system produced greater amounts of both CO2 and CH4, while sediments from the disturbed site consumed CO2 except in response to carboxylic acid substrates. In response to nitrogen-containing (amino acid) substrates undisturbed Phragmites sediments produced the highest amount of CO2 seen in any sample. Few differences in CRPs or PLFAs were seen in sediments from the disturbed site. The production of CO2 was significantly correlated with microbial community structure as described by PLFA profiles. This study is the first to use CRPs to describe estuarine sediment microbial community functional ability, and to link this ability with community PLFA composition. Our results suggest that individual plant species have a less pronounced effect than has been observed in upland soils in structuring salt marsh sediment microbial communities. Under anthropogenically disturbed conditions the effects of the macrophyte root zone on the sediment microbial communities may be overwhelmed, resulting in different ecosystem level functional abilities.

AB  - Species composition and ecological preferences of the most important periphytic diatom taxa were studied in lentic ecosystems in the salt marshes of Emporda wetlands (NE Spain). Correspondence analysis with the diatom communities suggested that water confinement/flooding gradient and productivity of the system were the principal factors affecting diatom distribution in the salt marshes of Empord wetlands. Hierarchical analysis clusters allowed 5 diatom assemblages be distinguished, each one characteristic of different degrees of confinement and productivity. Bacillaria paradoxa appeared as the most characteristic species in low confinement and high productivity conditions. Navicula perminuta and N. salinarum were representative of flooding and low productivity conditions. During maximum confinement and low productivity situations Cocconeis placentula dominated the diatom community. When maximum confinement was attained in the waterbodies with higher productivity, this dominance was shared with Nitzschia archibaldii. The 39 species considered proved to be tolerant to salinity and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter) variability. This seems to be a prerequisite for survival in salt marshes where the very dynamic nature of the system results in a large variability of the physical and chemical water composition.

AB  - This study compared soil organic carbon (SOC) in wetlands dominated by native and one invasive plant specie to better understand how short-termSpartina alternifloracolonization affected carbon circulation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Freshwater marsh dominated byPhragmites australis(FM) had the highest SOC, total nitrogen (TN), and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) contents, whereas SOC contents varied only slightly among salt marshes covered bySuaeda salsa(SM2),S. alterniflora(SM3) and bare flat (MD). Invasion byS. alterniflorasubstantially changed the molecular characteristics of SOC. The spectral characteristics of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of humic acids (HAs) were similar from 4000 to 1800 cm(-1)but differed greatly from 1800 to 1000 cm(-1)among four wetlands. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technology (Py-GC/MS) was used to characterize molecular fingerprints of HAs. Aliphatics (27.38%), lignin (16.64%), nitrogen-containing compounds (Nc) (16.16%), polysaccharides (16.93%), and phenol (13.42%) were dominant inFM, and aliphatics, alkyl, and Nc were primary in HAs fromMD,SM2, andSM3.Lignin moieties were only found in HAs fromFMandSM3, which accounted for about 16.64% and 1.6% of the total ion current, respectively. The absorption bands of the FTIR spectrum around 3340 and 1650 cm(-1)inFMsamples were much larger than those in the other three wetlands. However, the ratio of the peak areas at 1620 and 2930 cm(-1)(R-1620/2930) inSM3, was lower than that inMDandSM2, and it meant carbon inSM3was less stable. Proportions of lignin and phenol moieties to total ion counts (TIC) inMDandSM2were 3.3% and 3.4%, while these proportions in FM and SM were 30% and 7.5%, respectively. It showedS. alterniflorainvasion into salt marsh would increase SOC contents and its stability, while it will inverse if freshwater marsh was supplanted byS. alterniflorain the YRD.

T2  - CAHIERS DE BIOLOGIE MARINE
LA  - French
AB  - The influence of biodeposition by filter-feeding bivalves (Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis) on the evolution of salt-marsh meiobenthic communities of the French atlantic coast was studied over a 15-months period.  Quantitative variations of meiofauna were analyzed monthly and, during some phases of the year cycle, at two or three-days intervals.  The reasons for the recorded faunal variations were searched by principal component analysis among the main physico-chemical factors of the environment and more especially those related to the particulate organic matter of sediments.  Over the concerned period, it seemed difficult to point out the subtle effects of biodeposition on meiofauna as the seasonal factor, basically thermal, was found responsible for the largest quantitative variations observed in the communities.  Nematodes and harpacticoid copepods inversely reacted to the massive input of biodeposits.  Finally, the most striking effect of these was a lowering of populations very likely due to the strong reduction of the substrate (negative Eh) and a rather high content of ammonium in interstitial waters.

AB  - The effects of a simulated spill of sunflower oil in salt marsh sediments were compared with an experiment with linseed oil. Sunflower and linseed oil penetrated the sediments at the same rates but different adsorption of the oils onto sediment particles resulted in the establishment of anaerobic conditions at shallower depths in sediments contaminated with linseed oil than with sunflower oil. The total lipid content of sunflower oil contaminated sediments remained almost stable for 6 months, whilst only 40% of linseed oil remained in the sediment after 2 months. Numbers of culturable heterotrophic bacteria and aerobic oil degrading bacteria in muddy sediment increased rapidly in response to the presence of the oils but bacterial numbers in sandy sediments increased more slowly for sunflower oil. Changes in fatty acid composition indicate similar degradation pathways for both oils but sunflower oil degraded more slowly than linseed oil and thus has the potential for longer lasting effects in marine environments.

AB  - In the last decade, measurements of the tidal exchange of inorganic and organic materials, and their extrapolation for the calculation of annual budgets, have played an important role in assessing the ecological functioning and sedimentary status of coastal wetlands. Flux measurements, and their application to longer sequences of tidal flooding, for an enclosed back-barrier salt marsh in Norfolk, England, show how net import/export characteristics for a range of materials (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon), and thus the interpretation of wetland function, are strongly dependent upon the method of budgetary calculation. Annual budgets should be evaluated in a broader context which explores differing combinations of flooding regime, sediment supply and surface accretion, and vegetation production and decay.

AB  - The distribution of biomass among phytoplankton and free-living invertebrates was analysed in a shallow Mediterranean salt marsh submitted to fluctuating water level. Among phytoplankton, biomass accumulated in sizes dominated by mixotrophic species, indicating a competitive advantage for these species, which also prey on other smaller primary producers. Among invertebrates, biomass accumulated in the larger sizes, corresponding to species which partially exploit other nearby systems, such as the aerial environment (insects), or to those able to exploit particulated organic matter in marsh-bed sediment (amphipods). Biomass distribution models developed for pelagic systems are discussed in relation to fluctuating temporary waters. The integrated spectrum approximated (r(2) = 0.96) a Pareto distribution with a slope of c = 1.38. Intense disturbances caused a decrease in r(2) and an increase in c. Under stable conditions, two different tendencies were observed, depending on the degree of eutrophy of the basins: higher values of c were measured in the more eutrophic basins, and lower values in the less eutrophic ones. We hypothesize that highly irregular nutrient input could explain these differences.

AB  - Predominantly anthropogenic Cu, Zn, and Pb present in an approximately 100 yr old mud flat and salt marsh deposit at a high intertidal, oxic site are bound chiefly in the Fe-Mn oxide-hydroxide, organic and residual phases. The amount of each metal in the organic phase is significant and declines with increase in the age of the buried sediment, in harmony with the total amount of organic matter remaining. Application of a quantitative geochemical model provides evidence that those metals remobilized by the progressive oxic degradation of the organic matter do not swell the oxide phase also present in the deposit, but are free to be flushed back into the estuary.
