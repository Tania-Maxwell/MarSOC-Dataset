AB  - Current understanding of the soil organic matter (SOM) transformation pathways and mechanisms in coastal wetland ecosystems is limited. This study was carried out to characterize and compare chemical composition of below-ground SOM from a freshwater marsh and a saline marsh in coastal Louisiana. Composite samples at three depths (0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 cm) from each site were collected and characterized by solid state C-13 NMR spectroscopy. The C-13 NMR spectral composition of three soil depths of the freshwater marsh was similar and dominated by contribution from polysaccharide carbon (C), followed by equal contributions from aliphatic C and total aromatic C. A steady and more pronounced drop in polysaccharide C with depth, accompanied by the demethoxylation of lignin moieties, was observed in the profiles of the saline marsh. The delta C-13 signature of these marsh soils suggested that much of the C in the saline profile was likely derived from the mixed debris of previous freshwater and saline marsh vegetation rather than from the current salt-tolerant Spartina species alone. It was concluded that the chemical composition of SOM was determined more by the difference between the freshwater and the saline soil environment than by the C source in the coastal wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Microorganisms are among the most important organisms to the ecology of salt marsh estuaries; however, fundamental questions regarding their distribution, environmental controls, and interactions with phytoplankton remain unanswered. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of bacterial rRNA genes and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of phytoplankton photopigments to characterize planktonic communities from the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto (ACE) Basin and North Inlet (NI) estuaries on the South Carolina coast, USA. Multivariate comparisons of the planktonic community profiles revealed that the 2 estuaries supported distinct bacterial communities. Furthermore, bacterial communities in both systems were partitioned into separate particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) components. Differences in bacterial populations were also observed along the salinity gradient within each system. Comparisons of water physicochemistry with bacterial profiles indicated significant correlation of PA bacterial community structures with temperature, salinity, organic carbon, total phosphorus, and ammonium, whereas FL communities were affected by nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus and orthophosphate. PA bacterioplankton community structures were also associated with diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes and cryptophytes, while FL assemblages corresponded to prasinophytes, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria. Comparisons between estuaries further demonstrated that ACE Basin communities were mostly associated with the same pigments as PA samples, and that NI assemblages correlated with FL-associated phytoplankton, suggesting different trophodynamics of particles in the 2 systems.

AB  - While cyanide is known to be produced by many organisms, including plants, bacteria, algae, fungi and some animals, it is generally thought that high levels of cyanide in aquatic systems require anthropogenic sources. Here, we report accumulation of relatively high levels of cyanide in non-polluted salt marsh sediments (up to 230 mu mol kg(-1)). Concentrations of free cyanide up to 1.92 mu mol L-1, which are toxic to aquatic life, were detected in the pore-waters. Concentration of total (free and complexed) cyanide in the pore-waters was up to 6.94 mu mol L-1. Free cyanide, which is released to the marsh sediments, is attributed to processes associated with decomposition of cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, roots and possibly from other sources. This cyanide is rapidly complexed with iron and adsorbed on sedimentary organic matter. The ultimate cyanide sink is, however, associated with formation of thiocyanate by reaction with products of sulfide oxidation by Fe(III) minerals, especially polysulfides. The formation of thiocyanate by this pathway detoxifies two poisonous compounds, polysulfides and hydrogen cyanide, preventing release of free hydrogen cyanide from salt marsh sediments into overlying water or air.

AB  - Laboratory mesocosm experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of 2 crab species, Sesarma catenata and Cleistostoma edwardsii, on carbon exchanges across the surface of a south temperate salt marsh. The grapsoid crab S. catenata was most abundant in the vegetated marsh flats, and the ocypodoid C. edwardsii in the unvegetated tidal creek. Replicate mesocosms of the marsh flats and tidal creek were incubated with and without crabs of the species dominant in that region. Both species enhanced the losses of carbon relative to uptake by the marsh, but they did so via different mechanisms. In the tidal creek, C. edwardsii increased the net fluxes of total organic carbon (TOC) by 60 % (or 448 mg C m-2 d-1), but had no significant impact on community net production (NP). (Bioturbation accounted for 95 %of the enhanced TOC fluxes, and excretion only 5 %). In the marsh flats, S. catenata had no measurable impact on the fluxes of TOC, but decreased community NP by 1132 mg C m-2 d-1. (Ninety-two percent of this reduction was caused through reduction in epibenthic NP through crab grazing of microalgae. Crab respiration accounted for only 8 % of the reduction). The crab effects were sufficient to determine whether, for a tide of a particular tide elevation, the marsh functioned aS d carbon source or sink. When crabs were absent, the marsh functioned as a carbon sink at all except the very highest tides that, in turn, accounted for only 3 % of all tides inundating the marsh. When crabs were present, the marsh functioned as a carbon source at 87 %, and all except the very lowest tides.

AB  - The contribution of denitrification to sediment metabolism was studied at 2 sites (muddy and sandy) in unvegetated tidal creek sediments from a small Cape Cod, USA, salt marsh receiving nitrate-enriched groundwater flows (32 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Simultaneous measurements of sediment N-2, CO2, O-2, and dissolved inorganic N fluxes were made over annual cycles. A total of 46% of the ammonium remineralized within the sediments was transformed to N-2 by coupled nitrification-denitrification (D-n). Denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria contributed 15 and 18% to total sediment C and O cycling, respectively. C, N, and O-2 cycling rates were limited by both temperature and the availability of labile organic matter. Muddy sediment C content was twice that of sandy sediments, but was half as labile, resulting in similar mean metabolic rates between sediment types (mean muddy and sandy O-2 consumption rates were 62 and 58 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively; CO2 production was 58 and 46 mmol m(-2) d(-1); and D-n was 5.4 and 4.9 mmol N m(-2) d(-1)). Sediment delta(13)C (-18.5 and -20.8parts per thousand) and the molar CO2:N flux ratio (6.1) at both sites are consistent with a sediment metabolism based on algal rather than macrophytic biomass, and groundwater nitrate was the dominant source of N supporting algal growth. Annually, D-n accounted for 72% of total denitrification, with the remainder accounted for by water column-supported denitrification. Since all the denitrified N originated from groundwater nitrate, algal uptake must have initially out-competed denitrification for water column nitrate, but nearly half of this algal N was subsequently remineralized and denitrified.

AB  - To elucidate the influence of tidal marshes on the amount and chemical structure of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in adjacent coastal waters, surface water samples were collected along three cross-marsh transects in tidal marshes within the Changjiang Estuary. In addition, three sediment cores were collected from the marshes and incubated for 10 h in the laboratory after adding overlying tidal waters. Nutrients, DOC, absorption, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, and other parameters were measured in these samples, which clearly illustrated releases by the tidal marshes of DOC, and CDOM absorbent and fluorescent molecules. To characterize the chemical nature of the marsh-derived CDOM, variations in a suite of optical indices (including molar absorptivity, absorption spectral slope, fluorescence quantum yield, and fluorescence ratios between certain excitation/emission locations) in these samples were plotted against the offshore distance of the stations as well as the incubation time. From the literature, it has been suggested that these variations are closely associated with molecular weight, aromaticity, and humic/fulvic or allochthonous/autochthonous ratios in the CDOM mixtures. This study showed that the CDOM fluorophores changed to more humic-like and were less protein-like from sea to land across the marsh gradients. Furthermore, subtractions between EEM spectra before and after laboratory incubations were applied to illustrate in greater detail the properties of the pure fluorescent compounds exchanged at the sediment-overlying water interface.

AB  - Increasing salinity due to sea level rise is an important factor influencing biogeochemical processes in estuarine wetlands, with the potential to impact greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there is little consensus regarding what salinity thresholds will significantly alter the production of GHGs or the physiochemical properties of wetland soils. This study used a fine-scale salinity gradient to determine the impact of seawater concentration on the potential production of CH4, CO2 and N2O and associated soil properties using bottle incubations of tidal freshwater marsh soils from the Min River estuary, SE China. Potential CH4 production was unaffected by salinities from 0 to 7.5 parts per thousand, but declined significantly at 10 parts per thousand and above. Potential CO2 production was stimulated at intermediate salinities (5 to 7.5 parts per thousand), but inhibited by salinities >= 15 parts per thousand, while potential N2O production was unaffected by salinity. In contrast, soil dissolved organic carbon and NH4+-N generally increased with salinity. Overall, this research indicates salinities of similar to 10-15% represent an important tipping point for biogeochemical processes in wetlands. Above this threshold, carbon mineralization is reduced and may promote vertical soil accretion in brackish and salinity wetlands. Meanwhile, low-level saltwater intrusion may leave wetlands vulnerable to submergence due to accelerated soil organic carbon loss.

AB  - Tidal marshes have a large capacity for producing and storing organic matter, making their role in the global carbon budget disproportionate to land area. Most of the organic matter stored in these systems is in soils where it contributes 2-5 times more to surface accretion than an equal mass of minerals. Soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration is the primary process by which tidal marshes become perched high in the tidal frame, decreasing their vulnerability to accelerated relative sea level rise (RSLR). Plant growth responses to RSLR are well understood and represented in century-scale forecast models of soil surface elevation change. We understand far less about the response of SOM decomposition to accelerated RSLR. Here we quantified the effects of flooding depth and duration on SOM decomposition by exposing planted and unplanted field-based mesocosms to experimentally manipulated relative sea level over two consecutive growing seasons. SOM decomposition was quantified as CO2 efflux, with plant- and SOM-derived CO2 separated via (CO2)-C-13. Despite the dominant paradigm that decomposition rates are inversely related to flooding, SOM decomposition in the absence of plants was not sensitive to flooding depth and duration. The presence of plants had a dramatic effect on SOM decomposition, increasing SOM-derived CO2 flux by up to 267% and 125% (in 2012 and 2013, respectively) compared to unplanted controls in the two growing seasons. Furthermore, plant stimulation of SOM decomposition was strongly and positively related to plant biomass and in particular aboveground biomass. We conclude that SOM decomposition rates are not directly driven by relative sea level and its effect on oxygen diffusion through soil, but indirectly by plant responses to relative sea level. If this result applies more generally to tidal wetlands, it has important implications for models of SOM accumulation and surface elevation change in response to accelerated RSLR.

AB  - The effect of nutrient enrichment on benthic macroinfauna was examined in a long-term experiment that increased food supply in a macroinfaunal community inhabiting salt marsh muddy tidal creeks in Great Sippewissett Marsh (MA, USA). After 15 years of nutrient addition, macrofaunal density and production were higher in fertilized compared to control creeks, primarily because of the response of oligochaete species. Although mean annual total secondary production was higher in fertilized creeks (9.4 g dry weight . m(-2). y(-1)) than in control creeks (6 g dry weight . m(-2). y(-1)), P:B ratios for the key species were similar in both creeks, ranging between 2 and 3. Sustained enrichment shifted species dominance in fertilized creeks. Two oligochaete species, the naidid Paranais litoralis (Muller, 1784), and the tubificid Monopylephorus evertus Baker and Brinkhurst, 1981, became the dominant species responding to the sustained enhancement of food resources by the fertilizer addition. In non-fertilized creeks, the polychaete Streblospio benedicti Webster, 1879, remained the dominant species throughout the 15 year duration of the experiment. The fertilizer has stimulated growth of different oligochaete populations that are able to exploit different resources through the year (bottom-up regulation). During summer, the bottom-up effect of fertilization disappears, and predation controls invertebrate abundance (top-down regulation).

AB  - Recent research has highlighted the valuable role that coastal and marine ecosystems play in sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon (C) sequestered in vegetated coastal ecosystems, specifically mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes, has been termed "blue carbon". Although their global area is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that of terrestrial forests, the contribution of vegetated coastal habitats per unit area to long-term C sequestration is much greater, in part because of their efficiency in trapping suspended matter and associated organic C during tidal inundation. Despite the value of mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and salt marshes in sequestering C, and the other goods and services they provide, these systems are being lost at critical rates and action is urgently needed to prevent further degradation and loss. Recognition of the C sequestration value of vegetated coastal ecosystems provides a strong argument for their protection and restoration; however, it is necessary to improve scientific understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control C sequestration in these ecosystems. Here, we identify key areas of uncertainty and specific actions needed to address them.

AB  - Motile organisms are thought to play a role in biogeochemical cycles in tidal systems, but few studies have addressed links between animal activities and dissolved nutrients. Our observations and experiments indicated that movements, feeding, and excretion by fishes and shrimps resulted in subsidies of NH4+ and PO43- to intertidal salt marsh creeks. During low tide, isolated pools inhabited by nekton became biogeochemical hotspots with up to fivefold increases in water column nutrient concentrations. In field experiments, simultaneous measurements in artificial pools and an adjacent natural intertidal pool demonstrated that nekton were sources of NH4+ during day and night, contributing 17-109% of the net increase in NH4+ and 3-18% of the PO43- in the natural intertidal pool. Nekton residing in intertidal pools generated the equivalent of 5% of the total NH4+ imported to the creek. At night, nekton in pools contributed the equivalent of 12% of the NH4+ and 4% of the PO43- imported from the subtidal channel. As the tide flooded the intertidal creek, nutrient enriched pool water was pulsed up the creek and into the intertidal basin. Tidally controlled patterns of nekton movements and feeding result in retention and reintroduction of nutrients to the upper reaches of intertidal creek basins. Accordingly, nekton contribute to the recycling of nutrients through a positive feedback loop that may enhance primary production and invertebrate prey within salt marsh creek basins. We conclude that nekton can be important and underappreciated contributors of dissolved nutrients in tidal systems.

AB  - 1 Plant and microbial nitrogen (N) dynamics were examined in soils of an Arctic salt marsh beneath goose-grazed swards and in degraded soils. The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth.
   2 In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of (NH4Cl)-N-15 into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial N-15 excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of N-15. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated N-15 such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils.
   3 The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer.
   4 Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of N-15 in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion.
   5 Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention.

AB  - We investigated the seasonal changes and the interactions of the CO2 system in a marsh-dominated estuary, the Duplin River, on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Surface water pCO(2), total alkalinity (TA), and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) showed a pronounced seasonal progression in this system. The estuary released 256-306 g C m(-2) (of water) yr(-1) of CO2 to the atmosphere and exported log g C m(-2) (of water) yr(-1) of DIC to adjacent coastal waters. There was a clear seasonal pattern in both fluxes with spring minima, and late summer and fall maxima. Release of inorganic carbon as a respiratory product from surrounding salt marshes is the primary process supporting these two carbon export terms. Concurrently, TA was exported from the Duplin River mainly in summer and fall as a result of anaerobic respiration in marshes. Based on data from the upper Duplin River, export of inorganic carbon from salt marshes was 156 g C m(-1) (of marsh) yr(-1). Extrapolation of this value to all southeastern U.S. salt marshes indicates that they cumulatively export 0.7 x 10(12) g inorganic carbon annually to coastal waters. This export rivals that of riverine inorganic carbon flux. We propose that the CO2 fixation of marsh grasses and the subsequent export of inorganic and organic carbon is one major mechanism that causes the marsh-influenced nearshore and offshore waters in the southeastern U.S. to be annual net sources of atmospheric CO2. We also suggest that this process provides an efficient and unique means for ocean carbon sequestration of atmospheric CO2.

AB  - Coastal marshes play an important role in global carbon cycles, yet coastal development has led to widespread losses of marsh habitat. To address this problem, many coastal wetlands have been restored or created over the past several decades using a variety of construction techniques, but it is unclear if net plant carbon capture in constructed marshes is equal to that of reference marshes, or if rates of plant carbon capture are influenced by marsh construction techniques. To comparatively assess relative carbon capture by emergent and submerged vegetation in constructed and reference marshes, we measured standing biomass and carbon content in above- and belowground emergent plant tissue and submerged vegetation in three constructed areas (2-3 years old) and one reference area in a brackish marsh in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in 2009 and 2010. We also used aerial photographs to construct a GIS database of emergent and submerged vegetation coverage. These data were combined to estimate net annual plant carbon capture per square meter of marsh vegetation in each constructed and reference area. This index of carbon input to wetland vegetation suggests that rates of carbon capture by emergent aboveground vegetation and submerged aquatic vegetation were similar in constructed and reference areas. However, submerged vegetation captured less carbon (0.1-0.3 kg m(-2)) than emergent vegetation (0.2-1.7 kg m(-2)), and constructed areas contained an order of magnitude less emergent habitat than the reference area. Consequently, the annual carbon production of entire constructed areas (emergent + submerged vegetation; 0.1-1.2 kg m(-2)) was always less than half that of the reference area (0.8-2.5 kg m(-2)). Therefore, although productivity of emergent and submerged vegetation in constructed and reference areas was similar, the smaller ratio of land to water in the constructed areas reduced their annual rate of plant carbon capture at a larger spatial scale. To more closely mimic rates of plant carbon capture in reference marsh habitats, constructed marsh designs should aim to replicate the ratio of land to water in adjacent reference marshes.

AB  - The digestive tract of animals harbors microbiota important for the host's fitness and performance. The interaction between digestive tract bacteria and soil animal hosts is still poorly explored despite the importance of soil fauna for ecosystem processes. In this study, we investigated the interactions between the bacterial communities from the digestive tract of the litter-feeding, semi-terrestrial crustacean Orchestia gammarellus and those obtained from the environment; these organisms thrive in, i.e., soil and plant litter from salt marshes. We hypothesized that elevation is an important driver of soil and litter bacterial communities, which indirectly (via ingested soil and litter bacteria) influences the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of O. gammarellus. Indeed, our results revealed that elevation modulated soil and litter bacterial community composition along with soil organic matter content and the C:N ratio. Soil and plant litter differed in alpha diversity indexes (richness and diversity), and in the case of plant litter, both indexes increased with elevation. In contrast, elevation did not affect the composition of bacterial communities associated with O. gammarellus' digestive tract, suggesting selection by the host, despite the fact that a large component of the bacterial community was also detected in external sources. Importantly, Ca. Bacilloplasma and Vibrio were highly prevalent and abundant in the host. The taxonomic comparison of Ca. Bacilloplasma amplicon sequence variants across the host at different elevations suggested a phylogenetic divergence due to host habitat (i.e., marine or semi-terrestrial), thus supporting their potential functional role in the animal physiology. Our study sheds light on the influence of the environment on soil animal-bacteria interactions and provides insights into the resilience of the O. gammarellus-associated bacteria to increased flooding frequency.

AB  - This study examines spatial variability in sedimentary organic matter (OM). A total of 25 surface sediment samples were analyzed from two transects across a 0.5-km(2) salt marsh island; one transect traverses relatively old marsh and the other a mix of old and new marsh. We use elevation and distance to creek head as geomorphic proxies and associate them with the abundance (carbon, nitrogen) and the isotopic/molecular composition of organic constituents (i.e., lignin). Statistically significant linear correlations were observed between elevation and distance from the creek head with OM content, suggesting a likely geomorphic influence. However, the trend was positive for the older marsh and negative for the new marsh. Hence, sediment sampling at or near levees can give rise to a factor of 5-8 difference in OM content. Also, opposing trends were observed in OM provenance with old marsh having greater contributions of marine algae or allochthonous OM and new marsh having a predominantly autochthonous OM signature. Further, these data reveal two scales of variability in OM content and composition, one at similar to 10(1) m and the other at similar to 10(3) m. We ascribe the 10(1)-m scale variability to the effect of salt marsh geomorphic structure, while the 10(3)-m scale variability is likely related to the differences in local nutrient input and OM preservation and due to sediment source and accumulation rates and processes between sites.

AB  - The Changjiang Estuary (CE), two transects along the Andong salt marsh (AD-A and AD-C) south-west of Hangzhou Bay, and three salt marshes on Zhoushan Island (ZS-A, ZS-B and ZS-C) were coastal zones receiving different flow regimes and human activities. In this study, sedimentary P species consisting of exchangeable P (Ex-P), iron P (Fe-P), authigenic P, detrital P (De-P) and organic P (OP) were determined in these sediments. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the degree of P pollution and the potential for these sediments to release P into the environment. Authigenic P was the largest fraction in AD-A, AD-C, CE, ZS-A and ZS-B (42-62%), followed by Ex-P (28-33%), Fe-P (4-19%), OP (2-8%) and De-P (1-2%); except in ZS-C where Ex-P was the most abundant (57.86%), followed by authigenic P (24.45%), Fe-P (12.34%), OP (2.85%) and De-P (2.49%). High portions of authigenic P indicate presence of apatite minerals; low levels of OP and De-P suggest low P pollution and low contribution from riverine input. The sedimentary total P (TP) in these locations (ranged from 91.30 to 324.74 mg/kg) indicates the risk of P pollution was very low. However, the bioavailable P (Ex-P, Fe-P and OP) constituted approximately 37-73% of TP. Thus, these locations are prone to release P from Ex-P fraction under oxic conditions and from Fe-P fraction under anoxic conditions.

AB  - Habitat utilization by fish and decapod crustaceans was compared among 3 transplanted and 3 natural Spartina alterniflora marshes on the Texas (USA) coast during spring 1986. Created marshes had been transplanted on dredged material and were approximately 2 to 5 yr old at the time of sampling. Although conclusions are limited to the spring season, the use of replicate marshes allowed us to test the null hypothesis that transplanted marshes on the Texas coast were equivalent to natural marshes. Mean values for stem density and above-ground biomass of S. alterniflora were consistently higher in the transplanted marshes, and the difference was statistically significant for stem density. Macro-organic matter (MOM) in the upper 5 cm of sediment was significantly lower in the transplanted marshes. Densities of polychaetes and amphipods within transplanted marshes were positively correlated with this MOM. Transplanted marshes had significantly lower densities of decapod crustacea (primarily daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio and juvenile brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus) compared with natural marshes. This reduced utilization may have been a response to low densities of benthic food organisms, and densities of decapods were positively correlated with densities of prey in sediment cores. In contrast to the utilization pattern of decapods, densities of fish (dominated by the darter goby Gobionellus boleosoma and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) were similar between natural and transplanted marshes. These small fish may rely on salt marshes more for protective cover than for enhanced food resources, and above-ground structure in the transplanted marshes may have adequately provided this function. Comparisons of functional equivalency between natural and transplanted salt marshes require adequate information on how salt marshes actually function for fish and decapod crustaceans. For example, the use of prey density as an indicator of food value in a marsh can be misleading unless trophic pathways are well understood and access to the marsh surface is considered.

AB  - There has been considerable interest in a recently recognized and important sink in the global carbon pool, commonly referred to as "blue carbon". The major goal of this study was to determine the historical reconstruction of mangrove expansion (Avicennia germinans) into salt marshes (Spartina alterniflora) and its effects on carbon sequestration and soil chemistry in wetland soils of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. We used bulk stable isotopic, chemical biomarker analyses, and aerial imagery analysis to identify changes in OC wetland sources, and radiotracers (Cs-137 and Pb-210) for chronology. Soil cores were collected at two sites at Port Aransas, Texas (USA), Harbor Island and Mud Island.
   Stable isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of all soil samples ranged from -26.8 to -15.6 parts per thousand and 1.8-10.4 parts per thousand and showed a significant trend of increasing depletion for each isotope from bottom to surface soils. The most depleted delta C-13 values were in surface soils at the Mud Island (Mangrove 2) location. Carbon sequestration rates were greater in mangroves and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 sites ranged from 253 to 270 and 101-125 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Lignin storage rates were also greater for mangrove sites and for the Mud Island Mangrove 1 and the Marsh 1 ranged from 19.5 to 20.1 and 16.5 to 12.8 g lignin m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The Delta(8) and Delta(6) values for all cores ranged from 0.5 to 21.5 and 0.4 to 16.5, respectively, and showed a significant increase from bottom to surface sediments. If regional changes in the Gulf of Mexico are to persist and much of the marsh vegetation was to be replaced by mangroves, there could be significant increases on the overall storage and sequestration of carbon in the coastal zone.

AB  - Freshwater influenced wetlands (FIW), wetlands impacted by both freshwater flooding and underground seawater (MIW) and seawater influenced wetlands (SIW) were chosen as sampling sites to investigate the variations in the soil organic carbon content and stock in wetlands with different hydrologic conditions in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that a salinity gradient developed as the hydrologic conditions ranged from freshwater to seawater. In 0-50cm soils, the mean values of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and readily oxidized organic carbon (ROOC) were higher in FIW and SIW than those in MIW, while the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a higher mean value in MIW. Along the 0-50cm soil profile, SOC, MBC, ROOC and DOC decreased as the soil depth increased in FIW and SIW. However, in MIW, soil carbon initially decreased and then increased later. The annual mean values of SOC in 0-50 cm soils were 6.87 g/kg in FIW, 4.92 g/kg in MIW and 5.42 g/kg in SIW, respectively. The soil organic carbon density (SOCD) values for FIW, MIW and SIW were 4.55, 3.26 and 3.84 kg C/m(2), respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that SOC, ROOC and DOC were significantly negatively correlated with soil pH, bulk density (BD), sand content, and the C/N ratio, and positively related with water content (WC), silt content, and TN (p < 0.05). However, MBC showed a significantly negative relationship with EC, salt ions content, pH, BD and the C/N ratio, and a significantly positive correlation with TN (p < 0.05).

AB  - Intertidal flats, as transition zones where terrestrial and marine ecosystems meet, provide unique environments and play an important role in marine ecosystems. In particular, the environmental characteristics of tidal marshes show are different than those of bare flats, especially in the rhizosphere. However, unlike the rhizosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, the rhizosphere of plants in tidal marsh areas and the associated microbial community have been the focus of very little research. Thus, this study investigated the diversity and variation in bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of a Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica and along the sediment depths. High-throughput sequencing was performed by amplifying the 16S rRNA gene of environmental DNA extracted from sediment cores, and indicator species were identified with respect to the vegetation type and sediment depth. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes. In general, the results indicated that not only vegetation type and sediment depth themselves but also their interaction resulted in significant differences among the bacterial communities. The envfit results revealed that the environmental variables of sediment, such as mud content, organic matter, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen, had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The indicator species varied depending on the vegetation type and sediment depth, showing significant correlations with certain selected environmental variables, but were fundamentally related to the rhizosphere. Overall, this study revealed the key factors that determine the bacterial community structure in tidal marshes and the indicator species according to vegetation type in the little studied rhizosphere of the intertidal ecosystem.

AB  - Tidal wetlands play an important role with respect to climate change because of both their sensitivity to sea-level rise and their ability to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Policy-based interest in carbon sequestration has increased recently, and wetland restoration projects have potential for carbon credits through soil carbon sequestration. We measured sediment accretion, mineral and organic matter accumulation, and carbon sequestration rates using Cs-137 and Pb-210 downcore distributions at six natural tidal wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Estuary. The accretion rates were, in general, 0.2-0.5 cm year(-1), indicating that local wetlands are keeping pace with recent rates of sea-level rise. Mineral accumulation rates were higher in salt marshes and at low-marsh stations within individual sites. The average carbon sequestration rate based on Pb-210 dating was 79 g C m(-2) year(-1), with slightly higher rates based on Cs-137 dating. There was little difference in the sequestration rates among sites or across stations within sites, indicating that a single carbon sequestration rate could be used for crediting tidal wetland restoration projects within the Estuary.

AB  - Estuaries integrate atmospheric, watershed, oceanic, and human influences over space and time, Therefore, spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water-column properties are useful as metrics to evaluate external factors related to internal processes. The National Estuarine Research Reserve monitoring program, including the North Inlet-Winyah Bay complex in South Carolina, provides an ideal setting to track water quality relationships. Our goal was to assess hydrography, chlorophyll a, and particulate and dissolved materials from monitoring data collected at sites from both the salt and estuarine marsh components since 1993-94. Salinity, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, suspended solids, and chlorophyll a were much greater at the estuarine site, whereas organic nitrogen dominated the total nitrogen pool at both locations. Nitrate was a significant fraction of the total nitrogen pool at the estuarine site but not within the salt marsh. Whereas dissolved organic nitrogen was positively correlated to water temperature, nitrate concentrations were the lowest in the summer, Principal components analysis identified seasonal patterns within the salt marsh for temperature, chlorophyll a, ammonium, suspended solids, and particulate nitrogen. These parameters, grouped together as a primary component, were positively correlated to Spartina alterniflora biomass. In contrast, the estuarine site was more characterized by salinity, pH, and dissolved organic carbon. Although the water-column properties of the salt marsh site reflected a high degree of internal production and remineralization in the summer, patterns at the estuarine site were more likely influenced by seasonal changes in circulation and biogeochemical processing common to coastal plain estuaries.

AB  - Spatial variability of the properties of soils and the character of vegetation was studied on seacoasts of the Velikii Island in the Kandalaksha Bay of the White Sea. It was found that the chemical and physicochemical properties of marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols) are largely dictated by the distance from the sea and elevation of the sampling point above sea level. The spatial distribution of the soil properties is described by a quadratic trend surface. With an increase in the distance from the sea, the concentration of ions in the soil solution decreases, and the organic carbon content and soil acidity become higher. The spatial dependence of the degree of variability in the soil properties is moderate. Regular changes in the soil properties along the sea-land gradient are accompanied by the presence of specific spatial patterns related to the system of temporary water streams, huge boulders, and beached heaps of sea algae and wood debris. The cluster analysis made it possible to distinguish between five soil classes corresponding to the following plant communities: barren surface (no permanent vegetation), clayey-sandy littoral with sparse halophytes, marsh with large rhizomatous grasses, and grass-forb-bunchberry vegetation of forest margins. The subdivision into classes is especially distinct with respect to the concentration of chloride ions. The following groups of factors affect the distribution of vegetation: the composition of the soil solution, the height above sea level, the pH of water suspensions, and the humus content.

AB  - Stable carbon isotope ratios of bacterial biomarkers were determined to infer sources of organic carbon used by bacteria in the sediments of three salt marshes. Biomarkers studied were polar lipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA), mainly bacteria-specific, methyl-branched i15:0 and a15:0. Experiments showed that isotopic fractionation between substrate and biomarkers was relatively constant (-4 to -6 parts per thousand, on average) compared to the wide range in C-13/C-12 ratios of carbon sources found in the studied marshes. At the Spartina site of the Waarde Marsh (The Netherlands), biomarker C-13/C-12 ratios were depleted by approximately 6 parts per thousand more than expected for bacteria growing on Spartina litter and were similar to an unvegetated control sediment. This pattern suggested that local macrophyte production was of little importance and that other material (probably of algal origin) was the dominant carbon source for bacterial growth. Spartina contributed about half of the carbon in bacterial PLEA at the Kattendijke Marsh (The Netherlands) and dominated at the Great Marshes (U.S.). The variation in bacterial carbon sources in these marshes was probably related to estimated inputs of nonmacrophyte organic matter to the sediment. At the Waarde Marsh, a clear plant species effect was found as coupling between plant and bacteria was more important in Scirpus maritimus than in Spartina anglica. The contribution of local plant production to bacterial biomass in salt-marsh sediments is highly variable between marshes and depends on the input of nonmacrophyte material by sedimentation in comparison to local plant input, which in turn may differ among plant species.

AB  - Schoenoplectus americanus is a model organism for studying ecological and ecosystem responses of salt marsh plant communities to global climate change. Here we characterize 16 microsatellite loci in S. americanus to facilitate studies on the genetic basis of phenotypic responses to changing climate conditions such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide. Most loci also amplified in the morphologically similar sister species, Schoenoplectus pungens. Five loci exhibited species-specific alleles or distinct allelic size distributions that discriminate S. americanus from S. pungens.

AB  - The influence of salt marsh sediment extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) on metal fractions and organic matter cycling was evaluated on a seasonal basis. in order to study the relation between organic matter cycles and the associated metal species. Metals in the rhizosediment of Halimione portulacoides were fractioned according to the Tessier's scheme and showed a similar pattern regarding the organic-bound fraction, being always high in Autumn, matching the season when organic matter presented higher values. Both organic-bound and residual fractions were always dominant, being the seasonal variations due to interchanges between these two fractions. Phenol oxidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase had higher activities during the Spring and Summer, contrarily to peroxidase which had higher activity during Winter. Protease showed high activities in both Spring and Winter. These different periods of high organic matter hydrolysis caused two periods of organic metal bound decrease. Sulphatase peaks (Spring and Winter) matched the depletion of exchangeable metal forms, probably due to sulphides formation and consequent mobilization. This showed an interaction between several microbial activities affecting metal speciation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In laboratory studies, sorption of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in wetland soil and floodwater was strongly influenced by high levels of naturally-occurring dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Organic matter-dominated wetlands (e.g., marshes) containing high concentrations of DOC demonstrated no advantage over mineral-dominated wetlands (e.g., bottomland hardwood forests) for sorption of HCB due to partitioning in this DOC phase. Sorption of HCB was described adequately using a three-phase model that included the DOC phase. However, partition coefficients in the bottomland hardwood soil were time-dependent. This time-dependent phenomena was not observed in the freshwater marsh soil. Sorptive assimilation of organic compounds in wetlands appears to be dependent on the unique hydrological conditions that promote sediment-water exchange and accretion rather than any enhanced sorptive ability of wetland soils themselves.

AB  - Advective, dispersive and total dissolved oxygen (DO) fluxes from 1297 complete tidal cycles were analyzed to test the '' outwelling '' hypothesis as it pertains to DO. A 910 day time series of meteorological and water quality data (approximately 35,000 half-hourly observations) was used to assess DO fluxes and dynamics at Crab Haul Creek, a small (1.1 km(2)) tidal salt marsh basin at North Inlet, South Carolina, within the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.
   A basin storage curve, derived from water velocity measurements made across a permanent transect in the tidal creek every half hour for eight semidiurnal tidal cycles, enabled water discharges to be estimated from tide height readings in the 910 day time series. The discharges along with DO concentration measurements were used to calculate DO fluxes for each tidal cycle in the series.
   The long-term mean dispersive and advective DO fluxes were -0.281 g O-2 s(-1) and -0.375 g O-2 s(-1), respectively. Based on '' t '' tests both means are significantly less than zero (p < 0.02), indicating exports. Furthermore a significant correlation was found between the dispersive DO export and the tidal mean solar radiation, indicating that photosynthesis is the principal process driving the dispersive export of DO. On the other hand no significant correlations were found between the advective export of DO and solar radiation or between the dispersive fluxes of DO and salt. The absence of such correlations indicates that the advective export of DO is simply an artifact of a slight ebb sampling bias in our computation of the tidal mean discharge. On a unit area basis the average annual dispersive export of DO is 8.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) or 0.28 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1). This is a small fraction of the oxygen produced in the basin by phytoplankton (18 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1)) and its contribution to the DO resources of the receiving waters is far exceeded by the oxygen demand associated with the concurrent export of dissolved organic carbon (200-300 g m(-2) yr(-1)).

AB  - The trophic importance of different primary organic matter sources to macroinvertebrates was studied in the intertidal salt marsh (Scirpus triqueter) habitat of the Nakdong River estuary (Korea) using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of primary producers and dominant invertebrates, along with their biomass or abundance, were monitored monthly from December 2004 to November 2005. S. triqueter flourished from spring to summer and vanished in late fall to winter. Biomass of microphytobenthos peaked in late spring to summer. Of 25 taxa of macrozoobenthos collected, 7 were found throughout the year. Despite a dramatic seasonal fluctuation in the marsh club-rush S. triqueter biomass, the expected seasonal change in the isotopic signatures of the 7 dominant macroinvertebrates was not found. A large gap (3.5 to 12.3%o) in the delta C-13 signature between S. triqueter (-27.9 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand) and the marsh-dwelling macroinvertebrates (means from -24.4 to - 15.6 parts per thousand) indicates little utilization of this marsh-derived organic matter by the animals. Surf ace grazers and deposit f eeders (e. g. Hediste japonica, Heteromastus filiformis, Angustassiminea castanea, flyoplax pusilla and Paranthura sp.) had delta C-13 similar to VN and about 4 %. higher than those (- 16.5 +/- 2.1 and 8.7 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand, respectively) of microphytobenthos, revealing that mainly microphytobenthos-derived carbon contributed to their diets. Two suspension-feeding bivalves (e.g. Laternula marilina and Corbicula sp.) showed a similar delta C-13 to that of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in the channel (-23.0 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) and the Nakdong River (-24.5 +/- 1.9 parts per thousand). However, their delta N-15 values are about 4 %. higher than that of channel POM (5.7 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand), but lower compared to that of river POM (-11.6 +/- 2.3 parts per thousand), suggesting that organic matter derived from coastal phytoplankton, not river discharge, is a major nutritional source for these bivalves. Overall, our isotopic data suggest that the S. triqueter-marsh invertebrates are generally more dependent on organic matter derived from algal sources than on S. triqueter or terrestrial sources.

AB  - The formation of wetland channel networks on coastal river floodplains is affected by spatial transitions in tidal-fluvial processes. This study evaluated sedimentation patterns in tidal marshes on the 147-km tidal Columbia River and its 87-km estuary and characterized the cross-sectional geometry and planform morphometry of tidal wetlands along the estuarine to riverine gradient. Tidal marshes were predominantly depositional (median 0.7 cm yr(-1), primarily silt), consistent with late-Holocene rates. Marsh sediment accretion rate increased with annual maximum 7-day average daily maximum water depth. Elevation was negatively correlated with accretion rate in the tidal river and positively correlated with total organic carbon (TOC%) in the tidal river and estuary. TOC% was greater in the estuary and, like percent fines, greater farther from the main-channel Columbia River. For four single-channel and six channel-network planforms of tidal marsh, shrub-dominated, and forested wetlands: (1) Spatial patterns of cross-sectional morphology conformed to typical coastal wetland morphology in estuarine reaches up to the tidal river. (2) Reach-based and common slope linear models for channel perimeter on wetland area were predictive in the estuary (R-2 > 0.81) and differed between island (n = 144) and mainland (n = 164) wetlands. No planform linear models were predictive for the entire study area or the tidal river. No models for channel outlets were acceptable. (3) Channel perimeter, surface area, and outlets were all highly variable within and among estuarine-riverine reaches. Analyses of sediment, cross-section, and planform support the use of a "natural network paradigm" for wetland-restoration design on tidal river floodplains.

AB  - Salt marshes are capable of reducing metal pollution in coastal waters, but this capacity is highly dependent on the metal, the physico-chemical characteristics of the sediment, the plant species, the production of biomass, the time of the year, etc. The aim of this study was to assess the uptake and accumulation of Pb, Ni, Cu and Zn in Spartina alterniflora from three salt marshes within the Bahia Blanca estuary (BBE), a human-impacted Argentinean system. Metal concentrations in sediments and plants showed the same order at all sites: Zn > Cu > Pb = Ni. The site with lower organic matter and fine sediment content had lower metal concentrations in the sediments, but not a lower metal content in the plant tissues, meaning that the sediment characteristics influenced the metal concentrations in the sediment and their uptake by plants. Despite differences in sediment characteristics between sites, metals were always higher in the belowground tissues than in aboveground ones and, in general, higher in dead than in live tissues. Some metals were accumulated in plant tissues, but not others, and this is dependent on the metal and the sediment characteristics. Allocation patterns of metals in tissues of S. alterniflora were mainly dependent on metal concentrations, determining higher belowground pools, but the aboveground pools were important in some cases due to higher biomass. Partitioning of metals in above or belowground pools determines their fate within the estuarine system, since tissues can decompose in situ (belowground) or be exported (aboveground). Seasonal dynamics were important for some variables but were less noticeable than the differences between sites and tissues. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora from the BBE is efficient in accumulating some metals, despite usually low metal concentrations in sediments and plants. This accumulation capacity has implications for the whole system through the fate of the tissues. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Central aspects of carbon and sulfur biogeochemistry were studied along a transect extending from an unvegetated mudflat into a Spartina anglica salt marsh. Conditions along the transect differed with respect to tidal elevation, sediment characteristics, vegetation coverage, and benthic macrofauna abundance. Dark sediment O-2 uptake and CO2 emission at the highly bioturbated mudflat were low and relatively unaffected by tidal coverage. Sulfate reduction accounted for 30-60% of the daily CO2 emission from the open mudflat sediment. Sediment O-2 uptake within the nonbioturbated and vegetated marsh was up to seven times higher during air exposure than during inundation, whereas the difference in CO2 emissions always was less than a factor of 2. The contribution of sulfate reduction to CO2 production was low (<21%) and decreased progressively with tidal elevation as a result of the oxidizing capacity of S. anglica roots in the vegetated marsh. The boundary between the mudflat and the retreating marsh is a unique environment. High near-surface pore-water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) above the marsh cliff and highly elevated total carbon dioxide (TCO2) pore-water concentrations at both sides of the cliff during air exposure coincided with extremely high TCO2 emissions and apparent respiratory quotients (up to 14) only below the marsh cliff during inundation. We propose that substantial seepage of DOC-poor and HCO3--rich pore water may have occurred from the elevated marsh to the unvegetated sediment below during low tide followed by massive release of HCO3- during high tide. Accordingly, sulfate reduction accounted for more than the TCO2 release above the marsh cliff, but only for about 40% below the cliff. Mineralization rates and pathways in salt-marsh sediments vary considerably on small spatial and temporal scales and are dependent on inundation frequency as well as the composition and distribution of flora and fauna.

AB  - Intertidal creeks play an important role in transporting nutrients between coastal ecosystems and ocean. Reclamation is a predominant anthropogenic disturbance in coastal regions; however, the influence of reclamation on carbon and nitrogen species and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in creek remains unclear. In a subtropical salt marsh of eastern China, the seasonal patterns of dissolved carbon (DOC, DIC, CO2, and CH4) and inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N and N2O) species, and the diffusive fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O, were compared between the natural tidal creeks and the reclaimed creeks. Due to notably changed hydrological and biological conditions in the reclaimed creeks, concentrations of all dissolved carbon species, NH4+-N and NO2--N increased significantly by 60.2-288.2%, while NO3--N and N2O decreased slightly, compared to the natural tidal creeks. DIC and NO3--N were the primary components of the total dissolved carbon and inorganic nitrogen in both creek types; however, their proportions decreased as a result of elevated DOC, CO2, CH4, NH4+-N, and NO2--N following reclamation. Significantly higher global warming potential (0.58 +/- 0.15 g CO2-eq m(-2) d(-1)) was found in the reclaimed creeks, making them hotspot of greenhouse effects, compared to the natural tidal creeks. Our results indicated that changes in flow velocity, salinity, Chlorophyll a, and pH were themain factors controlling the dissolved carbon and nitrogen and consequent GHG emissions, due to reclamation. This study is helpful in understanding of carbon and nitrogen sink-source shifts resulting from land use changes in coastal wetlands. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Tidal marshes will be threatened by increasing rates of sea-level rise (SLR) over the next century. Managers seek guidance on whether existing and restored marshes will be resilient under a range of potential future conditions, and on prioritizing marsh restoration and conservation activities.
   Methodology: Building upon established models, we developed a hybrid approach that involves a mechanistic treatment of marsh accretion dynamics and incorporates spatial variation at a scale relevant for conservation and restoration decision-making. We applied this model to San Francisco Bay, using best-available elevation data and estimates of sediment supply and organic matter accumulation developed for 15 Bay subregions. Accretion models were run over 100 years for 70 combinations of starting elevation, mineral sediment, organic matter, and SLR assumptions. Results were applied spatially to evaluate eight Bay-wide climate change scenarios.
   Principal Findings: Model results indicated that under a high rate of SLR (1.65 m/century), short-term restoration of diked subtidal baylands to mid marsh elevations (-0.2 m MHHW) could be achieved over the next century with sediment concentrations greater than 200 mg/L. However, suspended sediment concentrations greater than 300 mg/L would be required for 100-year mid marsh sustainability (i.e., no elevation loss). Organic matter accumulation had minimal impacts on this threshold. Bay-wide projections of marsh habitat area varied substantially, depending primarily on SLR and sediment assumptions. Across all scenarios, however, the model projected a shift in the mix of intertidal habitats, with a loss of high marsh and gains in low marsh and mudflats.
   Conclusions/Significance: Results suggest a bleak prognosis for long-term natural tidal marsh sustainability under a high-SLR scenario. To minimize marsh loss, we recommend conserving adjacent uplands for marsh migration, redistributing dredged sediment to raise elevations, and concentrating restoration efforts in sediment-rich areas. To assist land managers, we developed a web-based decision support tool (www.prbo.org/sfbayslr).

AB  - Coastal wetlands are commonly exposed to hydrocarbon pollutants derived from extraction disasters like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Naturally occurring microbes can degrade oil, but the rate of oil degradation depends heavily on the key chemical and biological factors. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of interactions between marsh plants and nitrogen (N) on the degradation of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Oil disappearance was measured with gas chromatography (GC) focusing on the change in C-18 n-alkane-to-phytane ratio of oil, and instantaneous oil degradation rates were measured using an instantaneous carbon isotopic partitioning method. N addition often stimulates oil decomposition in soil slurries, but the effect of N in our mesocosms depended on plant species. N addition accelerated oil degradation in Spartina alterniflora mesocosms but slowed oil degradation in Spartina patens mesocosms. Across all plant and N treatments, oil degradation related to plant root growth. In many ecosystems including marshes, N addition has been shown to diminish root growth by reducing the need for nutrient foraging. Where N addition reduces root growth, N may ultimately exacerbate oxygen scarcity in marsh soils possibly negating or reversing the positive, direct effects that N has on oil degradation. Based on these findings, fertilization strategies that maximize marsh plant root growth will be the most effective at increasing the microbial degradation of oil and will have the greatest potential to mitigate the impacts of oil in marsh ecosystems.

AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and "reclaimed" for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada's Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m(-2) yr(-1), more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

AB  - Long-term assessment of ecosystem restoration projects is complex because of ecological processes such as succession, particularly in highly dynamic ecosystems such as estuaries. Restoration of intertidal flats and marshes on formerly embanked land, often called managed coastal realignment (MR), became popular in estuarine management. In our study, biophysical and monetary data were collected to calculate the value of 15 (sub) ecosystem services (ES) delivered by a large tidal marsh restoration project in the Schelde estuary in Belgium and the Netherlands. We hypothesized that ES delivery changes over time due to ecological succession and hence the long-term benefits are subject to this phenomenon and need to be taken into consideration. A marsh sediment accretion model (MARSED) was used to simulate potential marsh succession scenarios. In this way, the temporal evolution of ES delivery caused by ecological succession could be evaluated. Our study shows that benefits during successional marsh stages could actually be higher than for marshes in equilibrium. This finding does not suggest that ecosystems in transition always have a higher value than systems in equilibrium, but emphasizes the need to consider long-term ecological dynamics, such as succession, in a benefit assessment for restoration projects.

AB  - Under a changing climate, coastal wetlands experience sea level rise, warming, and vegetation change, all of which may influence organic matter mineralization. In coastal wetlands of subtropical west-central Florida (USA), we investigated how soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization respond to soil water, temperature, and ecosystem type (Avicennia germinans mangrove forest vs. Juncus roemerianus salt marsh). We evaluated how soil respiration and mineral N concentration varied along a soil moisture gradient, and whether these relationships differed between ecosystem types. Then, we manipulated soils in a 28-d laboratory incubation to evaluate how potentially mineralizable C and N respond to temperature (23 vs. 27 degrees C), soil hydroperiod (inundated 4 vs. 20 h/d), and soil source. Soil saturation and inundation suppressed short-term (minutes to weeks) C mineralization from near-surface soils. Soil CO2 efflux declined by 65% as soil moisture increased from 75% to 85%, and potentially mineralizable C was 18% lower with a 20-h hydroperiod than with a 4-h hydroperiod. Organic C quality appears to be greater in A. germinans than in J. roemerianus soils, as A. germinans soils had higher field CO2 efflux rates and greater mineralizable C:N (despite lower total C:N). Increasing incubation temperature from 23 to 27 degrees C elevated potentially mineralizable C by 40%, indicating that two symptoms of climate change (increased inundation from sea level rise, and warming) may have opposing effects on soil C mineralization. Temperature sensitivity of C mineralization was high for long-hydroperiod soils, however, suggesting that protection of soil organic matter (SUM) due to prolonged inundation will be undermined by warming. Potentially mineralizable N was greater in J. roemerianus soils, although in situ mineral N was not different between ecosystems, instead correlating positively with SOM. These results indicate that models forecasting soil elevation responses to climate change might include inundation effects on mineralization rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global changes are causing broad-scale shifts in vegetation communities worldwide, including coastal habitats where the borders between mangroves and salt marsh are in flux. Coastal habitats provide numerous ecosystem services of high economic value, but the consequences of variation in mangrove cover are poorly known. We experimentally manipulated mangrove cover in large plots to test a set of linked hypotheses regarding the effects of changes in mangrove cover. We found that changes in mangrove cover had strong effects on microclimate, plant community, sediment accretion, soil organic content, and bird abundance within 2 yr. At higher mangrove cover, wind speed declined and light interception by vegetation increased. Air and soil temperatures had hump-shaped relationships with mangrove cover. The cover of salt marsh plants decreased at higher mangrove cover. Wrack cover, the distance that wrack was distributed from the water's edge, and sediment accretion decreased at higher mangrove cover. Soil organic content increased with mangrove cover. Wading bird abundance decreased at higher mangrove cover. Many of these relationships were non-linear, with the greatest effects when mangrove cover varied from zero to intermediate values, and lesser effects when mangrove cover varied from intermediate to high values. Temporal and spatial variation in measured variables often peaked at intermediate mangrove cover, with ecological consequences that are largely unexplored. Because different processes varied in different ways with mangrove cover, the "optimum" cover of mangroves from a societal point of view will depend on which ecosystem services are most desired.

AB  - We studied the biochemical degradation of organic matter comprising marine diatom, land grass, and salt marsh plant in estuarine ecosystems in two laboratory microcosms consisting of estuarine sediments and coastal seawater. The materials were incubated separately and together under controlled oxic and anoxic conditions to test effects of co-metabolism and redox on overall degradation of organic matter. We followed variations of bulk parameters [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, delta C-13(TOC), and delta N-15(TN)], fatty acid concentrations, and compound-specific delta C-13 values over 3 months. Coexistence of marine diatom (relatively labile) with land grass/salt marsh plant (relatively refractory) in the microcosms yielded a negative co-metabolism effect (retardation rather than acceleration) on the overall degradation of organic matter. The ratios of oxic to anoxic degradation rate constants (k (ox)/k (an)) of TOC and most fatty acids were in a range of 1.1-1.7, implying that redox conditions per se had a limited influence on degradation of fresh organic materials in estuarine ecosystems. Variations of two bacteria-specific fatty acids (iso- and anteiso-15:0) and their delta C-13 values indicated that bacterial metabolism could use organic carbon (OC) from any available material when only one single-source material was dominant in the ecosystems. However, bacteria probably utilized OC preferentially from labile marine diatom when multiple-source materials were almost equally present in the ecosystems.

AB  - We investigated the direct and indirect influence of tides on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in a temperate brackish tidal marsh. NEE displayed a tidally driven pattern with obvious characteristics at the multiday scale, with greater net CO2 uptake during spring tides than neap tides. Based on the relative mutual information between NEE and biophysical variables, this was driven by a combination of higher water table depth (WTD), cooler air temperature, and lower vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during spring tides relative to neap tides, as the fortnightly tidal cycle not only influenced water levels but also strongly modulated water and air temperature and VPD. Tides also influenced NEE at shorter timescales, with a reduction in nighttime fluxes during growing season spring tides when the higher of the two semidiurnal tides caused inundation at the site. WTD significantly influenced ecosystem respiration (R-eco), with lower R-eco during spring tides than neap tides. While WTD did not appear to affect ecosystem photosynthesis (gross ecosystem production, GPP) directly, the impact of tides on temperature and VPD influenced GPP, with higher daily light-use efficiency and photosynthetic activity during spring tides than neap tides when temperature and VPD were lower. The strong direct and indirect influence of tides on NEE across the diel and multiday timescales has important implications for modeling NEE in tidal wetlands and can help inform the timing and frequency of chamber measurements as annual or seasonal net CO2 uptake may be underestimated if measurements are only taken during nonflooded periods.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a master variable in aquatic systems. Resolving DOC dynamics requires high-temporal resolution data. However, DOC concentration cannot be directly measured in situ, and discrete sample collection and analysis becomes expensive as temporal resolution increases. To surmount this problem, an option is to predict site-specific DOC concentration with linear modeling and optical data predictors collected from high-cost, high-maintenance in situ spectrophotometers. This study sought to improve upon the accuracy and field costs of linear predictive DOC methods by using machine learning modeling coupled to low-to-zero cost predictors. To do this, we collected 16 months of in situ data (e.g., spectrophotometer attenuation, salinity, temperature), assembled freely available predictors (e.g., point in year, rainfall), and collected samples for DOC analysis, all in a salt marsh creek. At seasonal timescales, machine learning (coefficient of determination [R-2] = 0.90) modestly improved upon the accuracy of linear methods (R-2 = 0.80) but offered substantial instrumentation cost reductions (similar to 90%) by requiring only cost-free predictors (online data) or cost-free predictors paired with low-cost in situ predictors (temperature, salinity, depth). At intertidal timescales, linear methods proved ill-equipped to predict DOC concentration compared to machine learning, and again, machine learning offered a substantial instrumentation cost reduction (similar to 90%). Although our models were developed for and applicable to a single site, the use of machine learning with low-to-zero cost predictors provides a blueprint for others trying to model DOC dynamics and other analytes in any complex aquatic system.

AB  - Dissolved copper levels, copper complexing capacities and conditional stability constants have been determined in the Tagus estuarine waters and one of the saltmarshes located in this estuary, the Rosario saltmarsh. Tagus estuarine waters show a constant and around 20 nM copper concentration during the estuarine mixing. Most of this copper is organically complexed by a strong ligand (L-1) with a concentration that varies between 19 and 55 nM and a log K' between 14.14 and 15.75. In addition L-1/Cu ratios are quite constants and close to 1 all through the estuary, indicating the same source. A second and weaker ligand (L-2) was also detected in these waters in higher concentrations (36-368 nM) but with a lower log K' that varies between 12.06 and 13.13. The present work has demonstrated that salt-marsh areas are important and continuous sources of copper complexing ligands to the Tagus estuary. Noticeable, tidal induced transport continuously feed these waters with copper and ligands, mainly with the stronger one. This continuous input, together with the high residence times of this system results in a quite constant concentration along the salinity gradient. This input represents 95% of the ligand present in the estuary. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf litter is an important nutrient source for benthic communities within mangrove ecosystems and in adjacent areas. Exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion to the eastern coastlines of China has been shown to alter trophic relationship of benthos in mangrove wetlands, but little is known about potential effect of exotic litter decomposition on food sources of benthic macrofauna. We took the advantage of significant differences in the delta C-13 values of exotic S. alterniflora (C-4 plant) from a native mangrove species Kandelia obovata (C-3 plant) to investigate leaf carbon assimilation by polychaetes during litter decomposition. We found that exotic S. alterniflora leaf litter decomposed more slowly than that of native mangrove species at the mangrove site (P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference between them at the salt marsh site (P = 0.270). The polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from K. obvata and the particulate organic matter (> 90%) at the mangrove site. But the polychaetes assimilated major organic matter from S. alterniflora (> 60%) at the salt marsh site. However, after adding S. alterniflora leaf litter at the mangrove site, polychaetes assimilated more carbon from S. alterniflora (> 45%) than that from K. obovata (< 25%). Furthermore, the significant carbon assimilation only occurred within a short period time (1-2 months) during decomposition. Our results suggested that Spartina invasion can change food sources of local mangrove polychaetes through utilizing the organic matter released from litter decomposition, but such assimilation of exotic foods is of short time nature.

AB  - Two tidal marshes in the New Jersey Meadowlands, one constructed and one natural were characterized to compare their ability to immobilize trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn). Surface and pore waters were sampled four times a year between 2008 and 2010 and sediment cores were collected yearly in the constructed marsh and once in 2010 in the natural marsh. Interactions of trace metals with redox active species such as iron and sulfide as well as with organic matter were investigated. Precipitation with sulfides played a major role in immobilizing certain trace metals, including Cr, Mn, and Pb. At both sites, the presence of sulfide did not preclude the presence of dissolved trace metals in pore-water at concentrations exceeding their metal sulfide solubility product. Thermodynamic equilibrium modeling indicated these dissolved metals remained in solution due to an association with heterogeneous dissolved organic carbon. No net trace metal accumulation in the surficial sediments of the constructed marsh was noted between 2007 and 2010. This implied that a dynamic equilibrium of trace metal flux into and out of the sediments was established, rather than a long-term net accumulation of trace metals. In the constructed marsh, little difference was found between the immobilization potential in the area of intermittent flooding (high marsh) and the area of sustained flooding (low marsh). The newly constructed wetland immobilized significantly more Cr, Mn, and Zn than the natural marsh and similar concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Pb. This may be due to increased redox buffering through a larger FeS buffering pool against tidally induced oxygen delivery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of bioturbation on sediment suspension and elevation loss by the Atlantic mud fiddler crab, Uca pugnax (Smith), were investigated in this study. High densities of U. pugnax occur in unvegetated areas of Cape Cod salt marshes that have been denuded by the herbivorous Sesarma reticulatum (purple marsh crab). The hypothesis addressed in this study is that U. pugnax then causes sediment suspension and subsequent erosion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that unlike vegetated zones sediments are rapidly eroding from dieback areas, but the various mechanisms by which this is occurring are unclear. In this study, we focused on the role that U. pugnax might play in this process through experiments that assessed sediment suspension during rainfall events and flooding tides, as well as elevation changes. The results indicate that U. pugnax contributes to elevated sediment loads in the water column and that the suspended sediment is transported elsewhere, resulting in elevation lowering. The loss of vegetation through S. reticulatum herbivory has resulted in a cascading series of events, with one of the consequences being an elevated potential for sediment mobilization and erosion by U. pugnax bioturbation. This has consequences for vegetation recovery and overall marsh resiliency.

AB  - The use of dredge material is a well-known technique for creating or restoring salt marshes that is expected to become more common along the Gulf of Mexico coast in the future. However, the effectiveness of this restoration method is still questioned. Wetland structural characteristics were compared between four created and three natural salt marshes in southwest Louisiana, USA. The created marshes, formed by the pumping of dredge material into formerly open water areas, represent a chronosequence, ranging in age from 3 to 19 years. Vegetation and soil structural factors were compared to determine whether the created marshes become more similar over time to the natural salt marshes. Vegetation surveys were conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2002 using the line-intercept technique.,Site elevations were measured in 2000. Organic matter (OM) was measured in 1996 and 2002, while bulk density and soil particle-size distribution were determined in 2002 only. The natural marshes were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, as were the oldest created marshes; these marshes had the lowest mean site elevations (< 30 cm NGVD). The six-year-old created marsh (formed in 1996) was higher in elevation (> 35 cm NGVD) and became dominated by high marsh (S. patens, Distichlis spicata) and shrub (Baccharis halimifolia, Iva frutescens) species. The higher elevation marsh seems to be following a different plant successional trajectory than the other marshes, indicating a relationship between marsh elevation and species composition. The soils in both the created and natural marshes contain high levels of clays (30-65 %), with sand comprising < 1 % of the soil distribution. OM was significantly greater and bulk density significantly lower in two of the natural marshes when compared to the created marshes. The oldest created marsh had significantly greater OM than the younger created marshes, but it may still take several decades before equivalency is reached with the natural marshes. Vegetation structural characteristics in the created marshes take only a few years to become similar to those in the natural marshes, just so long as the marshes are formed at a proper elevation. This agrees with other studies from North Carolina and Texas. However, it will take several decades for the soil characteristics to reach equivalency with the natural marshes, if they ever will.

AB  - Measuring fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is fundamental to estimating their impact on global warming. We examined diurnal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) vertical fluxes in a tidal marsh ecosystem. Measurements were recorded on neap and spring tide days in April and September 2010 in the Shanyutan wetland of the Min River estuary, southeast China. Here, we define a positive flux as directing into the atmosphere. CH4 fluxes on the diurnal scale were positive throughout, and CH4 emissions into the atmosphere on neap tide days were higher than on spring tide days. CH4 releases from the marsh ecosystem on neap tide days were higher in the daytime; however, on spring tide days, daily variations of CH4 emissions were more complex. The marsh ecosystem plays a twofold role in both releasing and assimilating CO2 and N2O gases on the diurnal scale. Average CO2 fluxes were positive on the daily scale both on neap and spring days and were greater on the neap tide days than on spring tide days. Diurnal variations of N2O fluxes fluctuated more. Over the diurnal period, soil temperature markedly controlled variations of CH4 emissions compared to other soil factors, such as salinity and redox potential. Tidal water height was a key factor influencing GHGs fluxes at the water-air interface. Compared with N2O, the diurnal course of CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the marsh ecosystem appeared to be directly controlled by marsh plants. These results have implications for sampling and scaling strategies for estimating GHGs fluxes in tidal marsh ecosystems.

AB  - The above-ground biomass of three dominant salt-marsh vascular plants (Juncus kraussii, Sarcocornia quinqueflora and Sporobolus virginicus) was measured to assess both spatial and temporal Variation and to provide baseline data. Additionally, the culm dynamics of the rush J. kraussii were measured so that aboveground productivity could be estimated.
   No distinct seasonal patterns were detected in above-ground biomass in J. kraussii. Averaged over all sites and times, the above-ground biomass of J. kraussii was 1116 g dry weight m(-2). Culms are replaced annually, hence standing crop approximated annual above-ground productivity. Much of the dead aboveground biomass appears to accumulate in the upper marsh, as evidenced by the elevated nutrient and organic carbon content of the soil there relative to the sediment in the mangrove zone. Above-ground biomass of the decumbent perennial grass Sporobolus virginicus and the procumbent perennial chenopod Sarcocornia quinqueflora showed no consistent spatial or temporal trends. The above-ground standing crops of these species were about one-third that of J. kraussii.

AB  - Twenty-eight tidal creeks along the South Carolina coast were sampled during the summer of 1995 to determine the levels of sediment contamination including organic chemicals (i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and DDT and its metabolites) associated with different types and varying levels of watershed development (i.e., industrial/urban, suburban, forested, and salt marsh). Organic analysis utilized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and capillary gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) for PAHs, and gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) for pesticides and PCBs. Results indicated that creeks with industrial/urban watersheds had significantly higher concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and DDT compared with creeks with suburban and forested (reference) watersheds. The suburban watershed class of creeks had concentrations of half the PAH analytes and the total PCBs which exceeded the concentrations found in the forested watershed class of creeks. The spatial distribution of organic contaminants was evaluated in four of these tidal creek-salt marsh systems representing urban/industrial, suburban, and forested watersheds, from, the creek channel. to the adjacent uplands. The distribution of organic contaminants within each representative creek was not concordant with the total organic carbon or the clay content of the sediment. The representative industrial/urban creek-marsh system, Diesel Creek, had the highest concentration of PAHs in the creek channel and the highest concentration of PCBs and DDT on the marsh surface, primarily in the upper portion of the system, The representative suburban creek-marsh system, Shem Creek, had elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs throughout the entire system. This system also had one site with a total PAH concentration of 324,000 ppb and a total DDT concentration that was 20-100 times higher than the other sites. One of the representative forested creek-marsh systems, Rathall Creek, had low levels of the three organic contaminants except for one sampling site that had PAH concentrations a factor of 10 higher than the other sites. The other representative forested creek-marsh system, Long Creek, bad low levels of PAHs and PCBs, but elevated levels of DDT were observed, particularly in the upper portion on the marsh surface. The results of this study suggest that (1) anthropogenic alteration of the land cover in the watersheds of tidal creek-salt marsh systems may increase the organic contaminant loadings in the sediment, and (2) tidal creek-salt marsh sediments, particularly in the creek channel, are repositories and potentially conduits of organic contaminants from the upland environment to the deeper estuarine areas.

AB  - This study focussed on the determination of the main trophic subsidies for three dominant filter feeding molluscs of the benthic community, namely, Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg), Mytilus edulis (L.) and Crepidula fornicata (L.), cultivated or naturally occurring in the Bay of Mont Michel (France). delta C-13 and delta N-15 values revealed that the diet of these filter feeders was primarily based on marine plankton together with a lower contribution of the organic matter derived from salt marsh phanerogames, as estimated through the isotopic mixing equations (Isosource). The microphytobenthos inhabiting the intertidal flat and the salt marshes do not contribute significantly to the diet of cultivated and naturally occurring C. gigas and M. edulis. Hence, in this bay, the major trophic pathways differ from previous results obtained in several coastal systems devoted to shellfish culture. This could result from ecological particularities and/or strong hydrodynamic conditions in the Bay of Mont Michel. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An oligohaline tidal marsh on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, LA was characterized with respect to the distributions and abundances of plant species over spatial and temporal gradients using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA).  In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA).  The distributions of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter.  They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity).  Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake.  Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens.  The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland.  Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions.  We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake.  Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community.  The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials.  Most of the annuals frequently co-occurred with Sagittaria lancifolia, which was the shortest in stature and had the least persistent canopy of the three mid-seasonal dominant perennials.

AB  - In nitrogen-limited temperate marshes, increasing nitrogen availability via biological mechanisms such as N-2 fixation and organic matter mineralization may lead to elevated marsh plant growth and macroinvertebrate densities. A polysaccharide, alginate, known to enhance microbial activity was added to sediment in a salt marsh (GA, USA) and the responses of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and densities of common macroinvertebrates with important roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow through detrital systems were examined. Plant characteristics and macroinvertebrate densities were measured over portions of two growing seasons between July 2007 and July 2008. Spartina alterniflora stem densities increased in the alginate treatment compared to controls after six weeks of exposure, and this difference was evident throughout the second growing season. Differences in plant heights emerged during the second growing season. Positive effects on Geukensia demissa densities occurred during both growing seasons, Littoraria irrorata densities were elevated relative to controls only in the second growing season, and no differences were observed for Uca pugnax. This potential for increased marsh productivity following carbon amendments may be useful in developing plans for salt marsh recovery.

AB  - We compared densities of nekton and infauna among 5 natural and 10 created (3 to 15 yr in age) salt marshes in the Galveston Bay system of Texas to test whether these marshes were functionally equivalent. Decapod crustaceans dominated the nekton on the marsh surface during both the spring and the fall. Densities of daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, the most abundant decapod, were not significantly different among marshes, but the size of these shrimp in created marshes was significantly smaller than in natural marshes. Densities of the marsh grass shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris and of 3 commercially-important crustaceans (white shrimp Penaeus setiferus, brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus, and blue crab Callinectes sapidus) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus were the most abundant fish collected, mainly on nonvegetated bottom adjacent to marsh habitats. Fish densities within vegetation (predominantly gobies and pinfish Lagodon rhomboides) were significantly lower in created marshes than in natural marshes. Natural and created marshes, however, did not differ in species richness of nekton. Sediment macro-organic matter and density and species richness of macroinfauna (mainly polychaete worms) were all significantly lower in created marshes than natural marshes. There was a positive relationship in created marshes between marsh age and sediment macro-organic matter, but marsh age was not related to nekton densities. Natural marshes were similar in having low elevations and flooding durations between 74 and 80% of the year; while created marshes were flooded from 43 to 91% of the time. In contrast to marsh age, tidal flooding was often related to nekton densities in marsh habitats. We conclude that marsh elevation and tidal flooding are key characteristics affecting use by nekton and should be considered in marsh construction projects.

AB  - We numerically classified tidal wetland vegetation and determined the relationships between variation in plant species composition and environmental factors. Sampling was conducted at eight sites along a range of tidal magnitudes (< 2 to >14 m). Cluster analysis revealed seven distinct salt or brackish marsh plant associations, usually dominated by a single graminoid species. Redundancy analysis showed continuous variation among community units and identified inundation time, elevation, soil salinity, and organic matter content as key correlates of plant community patterns. Associations detected were similar to those found in New Brunswick's Bay of Fundy and Northumberland Strait wetlands, and to those farther south in northern New England, but two new brackish associations were also identified within this study (Juncus balticus Willd. - Festuca rubra L. and Spartina pectinata Link). Although elevation is understood to drive vegetation types in salt marshes in the region, here we show that salinity can differentiate vegetation types at the same elevation. These data provide a quantitative baseline and allow for better predictions of tidal wetland ecological restoration trajectories in Nova Scotia.

AB  - Little information is available on biogenic elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) and the ecological stoichiometric characteristics of plants in coastal wetlands. To investigate the contents of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur of plants, and their ecological stoichiometric characteristics in the Yellow (Huanghe) River Delta, plant samples were collected from two typical salt marshes (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis wetlands) during the period of from August to October in 2007, and the ratios of C/N, C/P, N/P, C/N/P and C/N/P/S were calculated. Results showed that during the studying period, plant C, N and P were lower than the global average values, and plant N and P were lower than the China's average values. Leaf C and S in Suaeda salsa were significantly lower than those in Phragmites australis (P < 0.05), and leaf N and P in Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis showed no significant differences (P > 0.05). Average C/N ratios were 23.75 in leaf, 73.36 in stem, 65.67 in root of Suaeda salsa, and 33.77 in leaf, 121.68 in stem, 97.13 in root of Phragmites australis. Average C/N ratios of Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis were all great than 25, indicating the salt marsh in the Yellow River Delta is an N limitation system. Average C/P ratios were 276.78 in leaf, 709.28 in stem and 1031.32 in root of Suaeda salsa, and 536.94 in leaf, 768.13 in stem and 875.22 in root of Phragmites australis. The average N/P ratios of Suaeda salsa were 12.92 in leaf, 10.77 in stem and 10.91 in root, and the average N/P ratios of Phragmites australis were 16.40 in leaf, 7.40 in stem and 6.92 in root, indicating the Suaeda salsa wetlands were N limited and Phragmites australis wetlands were N limited in August and P limited in October in 2007. The average C/N, C/P and C/N/P ratios in Suaeda salsa and Pragmites australis were higher than the global average values, indicating the lower quality of organic matter provided by wetland plants in the Yellow River delta.

AB  - Seasonal changes in the assemblage structure of dominant epipelic diatoms were studied along a transect crossing a salt marsh, sandflat, and mudflat of an estuarine intertidal shore at Berrow Flats, Somerset, UK. Seasonal changes in cell numbers displayed different patterns in the salt marsh and sandflat/mudflat. At salt marsh sites highest numbers of individuals were recorded in summer followed by a smaller autumn growth, while in the sandflat lower numbers showed no seasonal pattern. Repeated annual patterns in the succession of taxa were not observed as environmental conditions changed at the study site with time. Measurements of salinity, pH, interstitial water content, air and soil temperature were taken together with the diatom samples. A canonical correspondence analysis was employed to relate seasonal changes in assemblage structure to measured environmental variables. Total percentage variation in the first four axes of the species/site-environmental biplots ranged between 54 and 66%. In winter, sites and species separated most significantly along gradients of salinity and levels of organic matter. In spring and autumn, interstitial water content became a more significant environmental variable. By summer steep gradients in pH, levels of organic matter, and hypersaline conditions separated sites and assemblages into more discrete groups when compared to the more even spread of points in the other seasons. The results indicate that different combinations of environmental variables influence diatom assemblage structure seasonally.

AB  - This study reports the soil-plant relationships along the intertidal gradient from unvegetated mudflats to the ecotone between high marshes and coastal dunes. The main objective was to establish the integrated role of spatial and seasonal changes in the sedimentary abiotic environment in relation to the establishment of the halophytes zonation pattern. The sedimentary environment and the halophytes coverage were sampled bimonthly during a year in nine intertidal habitats characterized by different plant communities. The highest values of sediment water content (40-60%) and electrical conductivity (20-30 mS cm(-1)) were registered in low middle marshes, the highest organic matter content (ca. 23%) was found in middle marshes, and the highest pH (8.5-9.0) was recorded in high marshes. The conductivity and the pH of the marsh sediments changed seasonally. The sediment conductivity reached its highest values during spring and summer. The spatial variations in the sedimentary environment were closely associated with the distribution of most of the recorded halophytes, especially in low and high marshes where the abiotic environment was more stressful. At the same time, cyclical seasonal changes in conductivity seemed to determine the distribution of the halophytes in high marshes, where the seasonality was very marked under Mediterranean climate. The combination and integration over time of these spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment defined habitats with contrasted abiotic conditions parallel to the tidal line and complex abiotic mosaics inside some of these habitats, allowing the cohabitation of > 30 plant species along the intertidal gradient.

AB  - Biogeochemical models that incorporate nitrogen (N) limitation indicate that N availability will control the magnitude of ecosystem carbon uptake in response to rising CO2. Some models, however, suggest that elevated CO2 may promote ecosystem N accumulation, a feedback that in the long term could circumvent N limitation of the CO2 response while mitigating N pollution. We tested this prediction using a nine-year CO(2)xN experiment in a tidal marsh. Although the effects of CO2 are similar between uplands and wetlands in many respects, this experiment offers a greater likelihood of detecting CO2 effects on N retention on a decadal timescale because tidal marshes have a relatively open N cycle and can accrue soil organic matter rapidly. To determine how elevated CO2 affects N dynamics, we assessed the three primary fates of N in a tidal marsh: (1) retention in plants and soil, (2) denitrification to the atmosphere, and (3) tidal export. We assessed changes in N pools and tracked the fate of a N-15 tracer added to each plot in 2006 to quantify the fraction of added N retained in vegetation and soil, and to estimate lateral N movement. Elevated CO2 alone did not increase plant N mass, soil N mass, or N-15 label retention. Unexpectedly, CO2 and N interacted such that the combined N+CO2 treatment increased ecosystem N accumulation despite the stimulation in N losses indicated by reduced N-15 label retention. These findings suggest that in N-limited ecosystems, elevated CO2 is unlikely to increase long-term N accumulation and circumvent progressive N limitation without additional N inputs, which may relieve plant-microbe competition and allow for increased plant N uptake.

AB  - [ 1] Coastal wetlands are sensitive to global climate change and may play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, the dynamics of carbon ( C) cycling in coastal wetlands and its response to sea level change associated with global warming is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the long-term and short-term rates of C accumulation, using C and C isotopic measurements of peat cores collected along a soil chronosequence, in a coastal wetland in north Florida. The long-term C accumulation rates determined by examining the C inventory and the radioactive decay of radiocarbon as a function of depth in the peat cores decrease with time from -130 +/- 9 g C/m(2)/yr over the last century to -13 +/- 2 g C/m(2)/yr over the millennium timescale. The short-term C accumulation rates estimated by examining the differences in the radiocarbon and C contents of the surfacial peat between archived ( 1985, 1988) and present ( 1996 and 1997) samples range from 42 to 193 g C/m(2)/yr in low marsh, from 18 to 184 g C/m(2)/yr in middle marsh, and from -50 to 181 g C/m(2)/yr in high marsh. The high end-values of our estimated short-term C accumulation rates are comparable to the estimated rates of C sequestration in coastal wetlands reported by Chmura et al. [ 2003], but are significantly higher than our estimated long-term rates in the marshes and are also much higher than the published rates of C sequestration in northern peatlands. The higher recent rates of C accumulation in coastal marshes, in comparison with the longer-term rates, are due to slow but continuous decomposition of organic matter in the peat over time. However, other factors such as increased primary production in the coastal wetland over the last decades or century, due to a rise in mean sea level and/or CO2 and nitrogen fertilization effect, could also have contributed to the large difference between the recent and longer-term rates. Our data indicate that salt marshes in this area have been and continue to be a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of higher rates of C sequestration and lower CH4 emissions, coastal wetlands could be more valuable C sinks per unit area than other ecosystems in a warmer world.

AB  - In order to intensify cattle utilization, embankments were constructed to avoid tidal ingressions in Samborombon Bay, Argentina, The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tidal suppression and cutting-frequency of a-salt marsh dominated-by Spartina densiflora Brongn. Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was almost 70% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high importance for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - This study presents a new approach to modeling marsh evolution. The Tidal Marsh Model (TMM) has been developed as a module within the SCHISM (Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model) framework. Some unique features of the TMM are dynamic rates, cross-scale simulations, and incorporation of anthropogenic stressors, which allow it to overcome many limitations that current marsh models possess. To evaluate model performance, the TMM was applied in Carter Creek and Taskinas Creek within the York River system (Virginia, USA). We assessed model outputs against field observations focusing on two main aspects: marsh boundary evolution and distribution of marsh sediments. Marsh change is captured with an accuracy of 81% in Carter Creek and an accuracy of 78% in Taskinas Creek. Different statistical descriptors were used to evaluate the model's ability to reproduce the distribution of observed marsh sediment fractions. Results in both study areas show a satisfactory agreement between sediment model outputs and field observations. This innovative modeling approach will help close some critical knowledge gaps in the current understanding of the system dynamics and allow better implementation of management actions to preserve these ecosystems and their services.

AB  - Tidal wetlands have been increasingly recognized as long-term carbon sinks in recent years. Work on carbon sequestration and decomposition processes in tidal wetlands focused so far mainly on effects of global-change factors such as sea-level rise and increasing temperatures. However, little is known about effects of land use, such as livestock grazing, on organic matter decomposition and ultimately carbon sequestration. The present work aims at understanding the mechanisms by which large herbivores can affect organic matter decomposition in tidal wetlands. This was achieved by studying both direct animal-microbe interactions and indirect animal-plant-microbe interactions in grazed and ungrazed areas of two long-term experimental field sites at the German North Sea coast. We assessed bacterial and fungal gene abundance using quantitative PCR, as well as the activity of microbial exo-enzymes by conducting fluorometric assays. We demonstrate that grazing can have a profound impact on the microbial community structure of tidal wetland soils, by consistently increasing the fungi-to-bacteria ratio by 38-42%, and therefore potentially exerts important control over carbon turnover and sequestration. The observed shift in the microbial community was primarily driven by organic matter source, with higher contributions of recalcitrant autochthonous (terrestrial) vs. easily degradable allochthonous (marine) sources in grazed areas favoring relative fungal abundance. We propose a novel and indirect form of animal-plant-microbe interaction: top-down control of aboveground vegetation structure determines the capacity of allochthonous organic matter trapping during flooding and thus the structure of the microbial community. Furthermore, our data provide the first evidence that grazing slows down microbial exo-enzyme activity and thus decomposition through changes in soil redox chemistry. Activities of enzymes involved in C cycling were reduced by 28-40%, while activities of enzymes involved in N cycling were not consistently affected by grazing. It remains unclear if this is a trampling-driven direct grazing effect, as hypothesized in earlier studies, or if the effect on redox chemistry is plant mediated and thus indirect. This study improves our process-level understanding of how grazing can affect the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of semi-terrestrial ecosystems that may help explain and predict differences in C turnover and sequestration rates between grazed and ungrazed systems.

AB  - Depth concentration profiles of PAHs, organic carbon and dissolved oxygen in non-colonised sediments and sediments colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa from Mitrena salt marsh (Sado, Portugal) were determined in November 2004 and April 2005. Belowground biomass and PAH levels in below and aboveground material were also determined. In both periods, colonised sediments were oxygenated until 15-cm, rich in organic carbon (max 4.4%) and presented much higher PAH concentrations (max. 7.1 mu g g(-1)) than non-colonised sediments (max. 0.55 mu g g(-1)). Rooting sediments contained the highest PAH concentrations. The five- and six-ring compounds accounted to 50-75% of the total PAHs in colonised sediments, while only to 30% in non-colonised sediments. The elevated concentrations of PAHs in colonised sediments may be attributed to the transfer of dissolved PAH compounds towards the roots as plant uptake water and subsequent sequestration onto organically rich particles. A phase-partitioning mechanism probably explains the higher retention of the heavier PAHs. In addition oxygenated conditions of the rooting sediments favour the degradation of the lighter PAHs and explain the elevated proportion of the heavier compounds. Below and aboveground materials presented lower PAH concentrations (0.18-0.38 mu g g(-1)) than colonised sediments. Only 3- and 4-PAHs were quantified in aboveground material, reflecting either preferential translocation of lighter compounds from roots or atmospheric deposition. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dynamics of reclaimed coastal soils under cultivation has not been well understood. In this study, we analyzed major soil chemical properties under two cropping systems (rice-barley vs. cotton-barley cropping systems) along a 60-year soil chronosequence created by intermittent reclamation of coastal salt marshes in Shangyu, Zhejiang Province of China. Soil horizons were identified and selected pedogenic properties such as soil salinity, pH, organic carbon (Sac), nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were used to characterize the horizons. Results showed that the soil profiles with 36-year or longer cultivation durations included the soil horizon arrangement of A-B-C, while those with 28-year or shorter cultivation durations had the soil horizon arrangement of A-C. The paddy soil profiles showed the plow pan and redoximorphic features with rice-barley cropping system, but the upland soil profiles did not show redoximorphic features and a distinct plow pan with cotton-barley cropping system. Rice-barley cropping system significantly increased the contents of SOC, nitrogen, diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-Mn, DTPA-Zn, and DTPA-Cu in 0-20 cm soil depth, but significantly decreased soil pH, salinity and potassium in 0-20 cm soil depth. The chronosequence of soil development was obvious in terms of increasing the contents of SOC, nitrogen, phosphorus, DTPA-Mn, DTPA-Zn, and DTPA-Cu with cultivation time, and decreasing soil pH, salinity, and the contents of potassium, total Mn, total Zn and total Cu with cultivation time except for no obvious decreases of total Cu in the cotton-barley cropping systems. Thirty-six years of cultivation history seemed to be long enough to differentiate paddy profiles with rice-barley cropping system from upland ones with cotton-barley cropping system in terms of soil pH, salinity, and SOC contents. Therefore, the direction and intensity of soil development undergone by the reclaimed soils depend not only on their natural characteristics but also on the way and time that they are managed after land reclamation. The results of this work could be helpful for management plans in reclaimed coastal areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interpretation of soil features produced by ancient and modern processes in degraded landscapes .5. Development of saline sulfidic features in non-tidal seepage areas
T2  - GEODERMA
LA  - English
AB  - Saline sulfidic soils are usually associated with tidal flushing zones. However, less developed saline sulfidic soils have recently been identified in non-tidal seepage and marsh areas strongly affected by waterlogging, dryland salinity and erosion in the Mediterranean climatic region (>600 mm per annum winter rainfall maximum) of the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia. A conceptual sub-model is developed to explain the formation of these saline sulfidic soils by using data from detailed pedological, mineralogical, hydrological and physico-chemical investigations.
   The following three saline sulfidic features were recognised both within the subsurface soil layers and on the soil surface: (i) black sulfidic materials, (ii) iron-rich gelatinous precipitates and (iii) salt-iron crusts. The abundance of these features and their distribution in relation to each other were used to establish a chronological order of formation. For each saline sulfidic feature, specific minerals (e.g. pyrite framboids, ferrihydrite and schwertmannite) were identified and their conditions of formation (e.g, Eh and pH) established. Their development is closely associated with two water-flow systems: a rising saline sulfatic groundwater aquifer and the seasonal discharge of fresh water via a perched water table, The conceptual sub-model shows how these two water-how systems and three biomineralization processes lead to the formation of these saline sulfidic marsh soils. It illustrates how the following three main conditions control the formation of these non-tidal saline sulfidic marsh soils: (i) the development of aquic and saline conditions throughout the solum, (ii) the accumulation of organic matter from which Fe and S reducing/oxidising bacteria derive their energy, and (iii) a continuous supply of Fe and S in groundwater aquifers. In the Mt Lofty Ranges, such conditions are due to rising saline sulfatic groundwater tables following land clearing since European settlement and contemporary weathering of pyrite lenses in the underlying rock.

AB  - Carbon entering the food web originating from microalgal productivity may be as important to salt marsh consumers as carbon originating from vascular plant production. The objective of this study was to further our understanding of the role played by microalgae in salt marshes. We focused on microalgal productivity, community dynamics, and pelagic food web linkages. Across three consecutive springs (2001-2003), we sampled the upper Nueces Delta in southeast Texas, United States; a shallow, turbid system of ponds and elevated vegetated areas stressed by low freshwater inflow and salinities ranging from brackish (11) to hypersaline (300). Despite high turbidity and low external nutrient loadings, microalgal productivity was on the order of that reported for vascular plants. Primary productivity in surface waters ranged from 0 to 2.02 g C m(-2) d(-1) and was usually higher than primary productivity associated with the benthos, which ranged from 0 to 1.14 g C m(-2) d(-1). This was likely due to high amounts of wind-driven resuspended sediment limiting production at greater depths. Most of the water column microalgal biovolume seemed to originate from the benthos and was comprised mostly of pennate diatoms. But true phytoplankton taxa were also observed, which included cryptomonads, chlorophyhtes, dinoflagellates, and cyanobacteria. Succession from r-selected to K-selected taxa. with the progression of spring, a common phenomena in aquatic systems, was not observed. Codominance by both potentially edible and less edible taxa was found. This was likely due to decreased grazing pressure on r-selected taxa as salinity conditions became unfavorable for grazers. In addition to a decoupled food web, reduced primary and net productivity, community respiration, and microalgal and zooplankton population densities were all observed at extreme salinities. Our findings suggest that a more accurate paradigm of salt marsh functioning within the landscape must account for microalgal productivity as well as production by vascular plants. Because the value of microalgal productivity to higher trophic levels is taxa specific, the factors that govern microalgal community structure and dynamics must also be accounted for. In the case for the Nueces Delta, these factors included wind mixing and increasing salinities.

AB  - The inner filter effects in synchronous fluorescence spectra (Delta lambda = 60 nm) of sedimentary humic substances from a salt marsh were studied. Accordingly to their type and the influence of plant colonization, these humic substances have different spectral features and the inner filter effects act in a different manner. The fluorescence spectra of the humic substances from sediments with colonizing plants have a protein like band (lambda(exc) = 280 nm) which is strongly affected by primary and secondary inner filter effects. These effects were also observed for the bands situated at longer wavelengths, i.e., at lambda(exc) = 350 nm and lambda(ex) = 454 nm for the fulvic acids (FA) and humic acids (HA), respectively. However, they are more important for the band at 280 nm, causing spectral distortions which can be clearly seen when the spectra of solutions 40 mg L-1 of different samples (Dissolved Organic Carbon - DOC similar to 20 mg L-1) are compared with and without correction of the inner filter effects. The importance of the spectral distortions caused by inner filter effects has been demonstrated in solutions containing a mixture of model compounds which represent the fluorophores detected in the spectra of sedimentary humic samples. The effectiveness of the mathematical correction of the inner filter effects in the spectra of those solutions and of solutions of sedimentary humic substances was studied. It was observed that inner filter effects in the sedimentary humic substances spectra can be mathematically corrected, allowing to obtain a linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity and humic substances concentration and preventing distortions at concentrations as high as 50 mg L-1 which otherwise would obscure the protein like band.

AB  - A series of diversion projects has been implemented to reintroduce Mississippi River water into Louisiana's coastal wetlands in order to reduce wetland loss. The export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured in a 3,700-ha ponded freshwater marsh that receives diverted Mississippi River water. Results show that highly organic marsh soil and plant material are a source of DOC. DOC, on average, was 3 mg/l greater in outlet water as compared to the concentration in river water entering the wetland. DOC in water leaving the marsh was higher in summer months, with a concentration up to 18 mg/l. Based on a discharge of 1,000 ft(3)/sec (28.3 m(3)/sec), it was estimated that the equivalent of 7,335 kg/day of DOC would be exported from the marsh into Lake Cataouatche, located in the northern portion of the Louisiana Barataria Basin estuary. Results suggest that river diversion would likely increase the export of DOC from the marsh as compared to normal transport associated with rainfall and tidal exchange.

AB  - The dietary importance of marsh vascular plants (primarily Salicornia virginica), algae and upland particulate inputs to macro-invertebrate consumers was studied in Carpinteria Salt Marsh, southern California, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. This marsh is predominantly a marine or hypersaline system and succulents are the most common vascular plant species. Of invertebrates collected from the vegetated marsh, tidal flats and channels, only detritivores from the vegetated marsh (Traskorchestia traskiana, Melampus olivaceus) had isotope values (delta(13)C= - 20 parts per thousand) that suggested some use of Salicornia-derived carbon. T. traskiana cultured in the laboratory on decomposing S. virginica or blue-green micro-algal mat had distinctive isotopic signatures, reflecting the capability of this consumer to assimilate carbon and nitrogen derived from these sources. The delta(13)C values (generally -16 parts per thousand 0 to -15 parts per thousand) of species from tidal flats and channels (e.g. Cerithidea californica, Protothaca staminea, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Neotrypaea califormiensis) were most similar to values for benthic algae and phytoplankton. Specimens of M. galloprovincialis along a gradient of presumed increase in marine influence had similar isotope values, suggesting little contribution to diet from upland runoff. The present results differ most noticeably from published values in the C-13 enrichment of suspension-feeders, suggesting the use of resuspended C-13-enriched benthic microalgae in tidal channels by these consumers, and in the C-13 depletion and N-15 enrichment of plants and consumers along a portion of the marsh boundary receiving inputs of nutrient-enriched perched groundwater. In general, the isotopic composition of macro-invertebrates indicated the incorporation of algal production rather than of S. virginica or upland sources into the marsh food web.

AB  - Growth and maturation of transplanted salt marshes is often limited by the availability of nitrogen (N). We examined the role of N-2-fixing benthic microbial assemblages (microalgae and associated bacteria) in two restored marshes (l-year-old and 6-year-old marsh) and a natural salt marsh in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. Benthic N, fixation (nitrogenase activity NA), chlorophyll a (Chl a concentration, Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) stem counts, and sediment organic matter content were determined in the three marshes. Significant differences were observed between sites for both Chi a and NA. The 1-year-old marsh always exhibited the highest levels of NA and Chi a. Sediment organic matter content was lowest in the 1-year-old marsh (similar to 2%), intermediate in the 6-year-old marsh (similar to 5%), and highest in the natural marsh (similar to 10%). Carbon and nitrogen analyses were also performed on the 1-year-old marsh sediments, which were depleted in N. a positive correlation was observed between surface sediment N and Chi a. Remineralized, microbially derived N may provide growth-limiting inorganic N to Spartina transplants. N-2-fixing microbial assemblages in the 1-year-old marsh may also be an important food source for marsh infauna. Benthic N-2-fixing microbial assemblages play a key role in the N economy of restored salt marshes.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion results in increased estuarine salinity, affecting both ecosystem nutrient dynamics and bacterial community composition in estuarine tidal marshes. However, whether soil microbial biomass (SMB) and bacterial community composition have different responses to low levels of salinity increase is largely unknown. We designed an experiment to investigate the stoichiometry of microbial biomass and bacterial community composition in both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along a low-level salinity gradient across two freshwater and three oligohaline marshes. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) significantly decreased in both rhizospheres and bulk soils as salinity increased, while microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) increased only in the rhizospheres. Rhizospheric effects increased the concentrations of MBC and MBP but did not significantly affect the concentration of MBN relative to the bulk soils. MBC/MBN/MBP ratios fluctuated drastically, and no clear trends were observed for both the rhizospheres and bulk soils along the salinity gradient. The composition of the bacterial communities changed greatly with increases in salinity, affected by changes in the proportional frequencies of the bacterial taxa, while bacterial alpha diversity was not significantly affected by salinity. A redundancy analysis found that the overlying water salinity and sulfate and soil total organic carbon had a synergistic effect on SMB and bacterial community composition. Our findings demonstrate that increased salinity, even in the low-level salinity range, had a large effect on decreasing MBC and MBN pools, increasing MBP stocks, and affecting bacterial community composition. However, it had a small effect on bacterial diversity. Also, rhizospheres exerted a major control on increasing MBC and MBP but rarely affected bacterial community composition or diversity.

AB  - The pathway for the flow of salt-marsh grass production into marsh food-webs is still not well defined. We compared the abilities of three marsh macroinvertebrates [salt marsh periwinkles, Littoraria irrorata (Say) (=Littorina irrorata), salt-marsh coffee-bean snails, Melampus bidentatus (Say); and a talitrid amphipod, Uhlorchestia spartinophila Bounsfield and Heard] to access standing-dead leaves of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel). The invertebrates were incubated with naturally-decaying leaves, and the rates of removal of organic matter and living fungal biomass (ergosterol) were measured. The impact of invertebrate activity upon fungal growth rates was measured as rates of fungal-membrane synthesis (incorporation of radioacetate into ergosterol). The removal rates of organic leaf biomass per mg individual biomass were highest for amphipods (700 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)) and lowest for periwinkles (90 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)), but the relatively large biomass of the snails made their removal rates per individual greater than those of amphipods. Net removal of ergosterol by all three invertebrates was >50% for yellow-brown (early-decay) leaf blades. For fully-brown (advanced-decay) blades, >50% removal of ergosterol was found only for periwinkles; exposure to coffee-bean snails and amphipods resulted in a net ergosterol reduction of less than or equal to 20%. The lower net reduction of living fungal biomass by coffee-bean snails and amphipods may have been due to fungal-growth stimulation (2.3-fold stimulation in coffee-bean snails and 1.5-fold stimulation in amphipods). Grazing by periwinkles did not stimulate fungal growth, possibly because of its high intensity. Grazing by these three salt-marsh shredders may affect marsh-grass shoot-decay in different ways. Periwinkles may abbreviate the period of fungal production, and incorporate the decaying material relatively quickly into snail biomass and fecal-pellet rain to the sediments. Coffee-bean snails and amphipods may enhance and prolong fungal production, along with the formation of fecal-pellet rain. All three invertebrates fed preferentially on leaf blades rather than leaf sheaths, and feeding rates of gastropods were higher during the night than during the day.

AB  - The impact of benthic macrofauna (Nereis diversicolor) and macrophytes (Spartina anglica) on the dynamics of microbial mineralization rates and pathways in saltmarsh sediment was studied over 1 growing season. Measurements were conducted in 4 saltmarsh mesocosms subjected to a natural tidal regime, and inhabited by either flora, fauna or both,or kept without the presence of, macroorganisms. Total benthic mineralization was measured during spring, summer and fall as sediment oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release under air-exposed as well as inundated conditions, while anaerobic mineralization was quantified as sulfate reduction. Porewater concentration profiles of total carbon dioxide (TCO2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), SO42-, Cl- and Fe2+, were determined monthly. The presence of fauna had minor effects on plant growth, while sediment vegetated by S. anglica renders the habitat unsuitable for N. diversicolor, possibly due to food limitation. Without the presence of macroorganisms, a dense algal mat (Vaucheria sp.) developed on the sediment surface. As a result, the sediment was greatly reduced with benthic respiration completely dominated by sulfate reduction. Grazing by fauna (N. diversicolor) kept the sediment surface free of epibenthic microalgae, and irrigation oxidized the top 15 to 20 cm of the sediment by enhancing porewater exchange with overlying water. Porewater TCO2, DOC and Fe 21 only accumulated below 15 to 20 cm depth. Sulfate reduction was still the dominating degradation pathway, accounting for 50 to 60% of the total microbial mineralization. The presence of flora (S. anglica) enhanced total microbial mineralization but lowered the importance of sulfate reduction (22 to 54%). Porewater constituents such as DOC and TCO2 were kept low and relatively evenly distributed with depth. The oxidizing capacity of S. anglica was evident throughout the sediment column. The presence of both flora and fauna produced the largest increase in oxic as well as total microbial mineralization rates. In conclusion, the mesocosm approach simulated natural salt marsh conditions well, and the results provide good evidence for the interactions between flora and fauna as well as their impact on sediment geochemistry.

AB  - Straw addition can increase the content of soil organic carbon (SOC), and affect the content of aggregates and organic carbon fractions. The changes in aggregates and organic carbon fractions in the natural salt marsh, 10-year and 15-year freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary were studied by 120-day field in situ culture experiments with Phragmites australis straw addition. The results showed that straw addition mainly enhanced the soil aggregate stability in the 10-year freshwater pumping area, and the organic carbon content of small macro-aggregates increased significantly by 26.36% (P < 0.05). In particular, the content of coarse particulate organic carbon (cPOC) with small macro-aggregates in all areas increased significantly with the addition of straw (P < 0.05). For small macro-aggregates in the 10-year pumping area, the cPOC contents increased significantly by 21.73 g/kg (P < 0.05); and were significantly higher than the fine particulate organic carbon (fPOC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (mSOC) contents, as the fPOC contents in micro-aggregates increased by 85.92% (P < 0.05). Additionally, the cPOC contents of small macro-aggregates and fPOC contents of micro aggregates increased by 34.59% and 43.24% in the 15-year pumping area. The contents of mSOC were the lowest in different aggregates across all areas. Thus, straw addition had a significant effect on the contents of cPOC and fPOC, while freshwater pumping in the YRE could affect the distribution of fPOC and mSOC with aggregates.

AB  - Nitrous oxide is a powerful, long-lived greenhouse gas, but we know little about the role of estuarine areas in the global N2O budget. This review summarizes 56 studies of N2O fluxes and associated biogeochemical controlling factors in estuarine open waters, salt marshes, mangroves, and intertidal sediments. The majority of in situ N2O production occurs as a result of sediment denitrification, although the water column contributes N2O through nitrification in suspended particles. The most important factors controlling N2O fluxes seem to be dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and oxygen availability, which in turn are affected by tidal cycles, groundwater inputs, and macrophyte density. The heterogeneity of coastal environments leads to a high variability in observations, but on average estuarine open water, intertidal and vegetated environments are sites of a small positive N2O flux to the atmosphere (range 0.15-0.91; median 0.31; Tg N2O-N yr(-1)). Global changes in macrophyte distribution and anthropogenic nitrogen loading are expected to increase N2O emissions from estuaries. We estimate that a doubling of current median NO3- concentrations would increase the global estuary water-air N2O flux by about 0.45 Tg N2O-N yr(-1) or about 190%. A loss of 50% of mangrove habitat, being converted to unvegetated intertidal area, would result in a net decrease in N2O emissions of 0.002 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). In contrast, conversion of 50% of salt marsh to unvegetated area would result in a net increase of 0.001 Tg N2O-N yr(-1). Decreased oxygen concentrations may inhibit production of N2O by nitrification; however, sediment denitrification and the associated ratio of N2O:N-2 is expected to increase.

AB  - The dynamic changes of soil microorganisms after Phragmites oust rails straw addition in the incubation tubes were analyzed by phospholipid fatty acid stable isotope probing (PLEA-SIP). After comparing soils from different freshwater pumping areas in the Yellow River Estuary (10-year pumping area, 15-year pumping area and natural salt marsh without pumping), the results showed that the total PLEA contents significantly increased by 59.99%-146.93% after the addition of straw to surface soils (0-10 cm) in the pumping areas, whereas the changes in deeper soils (10-20 cm) were not significant. In particular, the PLFA results showed that bacteria and fungi were significantly increased after 10 days with straw addition. Straw treatment also improved the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in the surface soils of all sampling sites. The soil microorganisms directly absorbed straw-derived C-13, where Gram-negative bacteria (GN) were found to have the highest PLFA-C-13 values during the 40-day decomposition process. Soil characteristics can significantly affect microbial community composition. Accordingly, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly positively related to bacterial, fungal and other microbial biomasses, while moisture, electric conductivity (EC) and soil aggregate composition were important factors of influence on the microbial community. The findings indicated that both fungi and bacteria were essential microbial communities in straw decomposition, the significant increase of fungi biomass and the absorption of straw-derived C-13 by bacteria were the main changes of microbial community. Long-term freshwater pumping can promote straw decomposition by increasing microbial biomass and changing microbial community composition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salt pools (shallow water filled depressions) are common landforms in north temperate salt marshes Despite their widespread distribution the origin of pools as primary or secondary features of salt marshes remains uncertain and their description in the geologic record unclear This study combines analyses of modern sediments and cores to determine pool origin and describe pool deposits We collected samples from tidal flat tidal creek salt pool low marsh and high marsh environments and 23 Dutch cores through extant and paleopools from salt marshes in Ogunquit Wells Brunswick Gouldsboro Addison and Lubec Maine Salt pool sediment is a dark gray high water content mud with intermediate total organic carbon values (2 21-9 08) and typically lower carbon to nitrogen ratios than low and high marsh sediments Pool sediment contains a suite of biological macrofossils, most common are drupes of the submerged aquatic plant Ruppia maritima and the gastropod Hydrobia totteni Microfossil analyses reveal no unique foraminiferal assemblages associated with pools though mites (subclass Acarina) were commonly found within pool sediment Cores reveal that most studied pools are of secondary not primary origin and that many are dynamic features of these salt marshes some rapidly in filling with sediment when drained Our results suggest that local pool dynamics (that may or may not be linked to larger regional signals like sea level change) dominate the geologic records in many of these marshes Correct interpretations of core records hinge on the correct identification of the cores subunits with the salt pool unit now identified and defined re examinations and potential reinterpretations of salt marsh stratigraphic records are warranted

AB  - We compared the functions and values of fringing salt marshes to those of meadow marshes along the southern Maine/New Hampshire coast. Differences included soil organic matter content, plant species richness, and percent cover of high and low-marsh species. More sediment was trapped per unit area in fringing marshes than in meadow marshes, but this difference was not significant. Similarities included aboveground and belowground peak season biomass and the ability to dampen wave energy. Both marsh types reduced the height of waves coming onto the marsh surface by 63% only 7 m into the marsh. Fringing marshes are diverse in terms of their physical characteristics (width, length, slope, elevation, soils). Despite their small size, they are valuable components of estuaries, performing many ecological functions to the same degree as nearby meadow marshes. More effort should be made to include them in regional efforts to conserve and restore coastal habitats.

AB  - Drainage of interstitial water from creekbanks vegetated by tall Spartina alterniflora was directly measured using an in situ chamber technique over complete tidal cycles throughout the year in the Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Massachusetts, USA. Estimates of porewater seepage into chambers compared favorably with water exchange calculated from parallel measurements of water table excursion and sediment-specific yield when plants were inactive. Upon low tide exposure of the marsh surface, there was an initial large loss of porewater, then a continuously declining discharge which paralleled the pattern of water table drop in the adjacent creekbank sediments. Seepage losses were related to the vertical height of the creekbank with banks ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 m showing more than a 3-fold greater discharge than those only 0.25 to 0.5 m high on a linear basis and nearly 2-fold greater on an areal basis. Strong seasonal variations in seepage volume and extent of low tide water table excursion occurred in the tall S. alterniflora zone. In summer when water removal was through both drainage and evapotranspiration, the water table fell at almost twice the rate as in winter when drainage predominated. The annually averaged volume of creekbank seepage was 15.2 l m(-2) or 8.9 l m(-1) per tide. The magnitude of the seepage pathway for organic matter and nutrient export from marsh sediments was assessed from simultaneous measurements of seepage volume and concentrations of DOC, NH4+, NO3-+NO2-, and PO43- in both seepage and tidal waters. Sediments underlying tall S. alterniflora showed a net export of DOC of 1080 mmol C m(-2) yr(-1) (544 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), NH4+ 115 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) (57 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), and NO3-+NO2- 6.5 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) (4.7 mmol m(-1) yr(-1)), while PO43- was imported from tidal waters. Measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen losses in drainage waters represent only about 3% of the inorganic nitrogen export from this marsh. While porewater drainage was a major factor in the water budget of creekbank areas and represents a potential aeration subsidy to sediment oxidation, it was not found to be a significant pathway for the transfer of organic carbon or inorganic nutrients from the Spartina root zone to tidal waters.

CP  - International Symposium on Suspended Particulate Matter in Rivers and Estuaries
AB  - The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Georgia rivers are significantly higher than the concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC). This dissolved organic matter (DOM) is shown to be composed mainly of DOC large than 10,000 dal, nominal molecular weight (NMW). The concentrations of this large molecular size fraction of the DOC appear to vary relative to river flow. Up to 25 % of the large molecular size carbon brought to the marshes by rivers form particulates when contacting the salinity gradients at the head of the estuaries. This newly formed POC has an enriched N/C ratio relative to riverine DOC. Concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are equal to or greater than inorganic nitrogen in these river systems indicating that DON may represent a significant source of nitrogen to heterotrophs in the estuaries. Annual flux of carbon as DOC and nitrogen as DON from the Georgia upland watersheds to the salt marsh estuaries is 23.6 +/- 3.5 thousands of tonnes C and 11.3 +/- 2.6 hundreds of tonnes N, respectively.

AB  - The overall dependence of benthic secondary production on the main primary producers at three different habitats in the Nakdong River estuarine system, Korea, was estimated. Inventories of macrobenthic invertebrate biomass were combined with multiple-isotope-mixing models to evaluate the trophic base, comparing Scirpus triqueter-dominated and Phragmites australis-dominated marshes and bare intertidal flat. The feasible contributions of four main food sources, marsh macrophytes, the microphytobenthos, and riverine and marine suspended particulate organic matter (RPOM and MPOM), to the consumer biomasses were calculated using the isotopic mixing model. After weighting the feasible contributions of food sources to each taxon by the consumer biomass, the resultant values were summed for all the consumers at each habitat to quantify the trophic base of the benthic invertebrate community. Dual-isotope-mixing model calculations verified the varying dependence on those potential food sources among the functional feeding groups. In addition, the dependence on each source of the same functional group varied between bare intertidal and salt-marsh habitats, shifting from a dominance of benthic and pelagic microalgal sources on the former habitat to a mixed food source at the latter habitat. The biomasses of the species comprising each functional group differed among habitats and sampling dates, so that each functional group made a different contribution to the whole benthic community and its basal food source. Given the calculation of the overall dependence of macrozoobenthic community on each food source, our results indicate that the microphytobenthic source dominates (nearly half) the trophic base in all the intertidal habitats of different vegetational compositions. Marsh-macrophyte-derived organic matter and RPOM served as considerable subsidies only to salt-marsh food webs, reflecting the use of the mixed food source by salt-marsh-bed consumers. Conversely, the dominance of MPOM in the total food base was equal to that of the microphytobenthos in the bare intertidal ecosystem but increased during spring-summer in the salt-marsh systems. Our results also suggest that the river discharge concentrated during the summer monsoon does not lead to any shift in trophic base for estuarine secondary production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Temperatures are increasing globally and causing species-specific geographic range expansions. In the Gulf of Mexico, mangroves are encroaching regions historically dominated by temperate salt marshes, changing animal communities and nutrient cycling in the intertidal zone. Marine systems are highly connected; therefore, we expect that changes in the intertidal will alter functions of adjacent subtidal seagrass meadows. We surveyed seagrass meadows adjacent to mangroves, salt marshes, and a mixture of the two and asked, do changes in intertidal plant composition influence (1) environmental conditions (subtidal water and sediment characteristics); (2) biogeochemical cycling (net oxygen and nitrogen gas fluxes); (3) seagrass meadow cover, biomass, and productivity; and (4) invertebrate community assemblage? There are clear differences in sediment organic matter and net nitrogen gas (N-2) fluxes between adjacent intertidal habitats, but the magnitude or direction of change differs seasonally. We hypothesize that this seasonal pattern is due to outwelling from the intertidal, as mangroves senesce in fall, and marshes senesce later in winter. Therefore, changes in adjacent intertidal habitat can impact the timing of organic matter delivery. This also has implications for seagrass biomass. Thalassia testudinum belowground biomass adjacent to mangroves substantially decreased over the winter, suggesting vulnerability to stressors as the intertidal plant community shifts from marsh to mangrove dominance. Epifauna density and diversity did not vary among seagrass meadows based on adjacent intertidal habitats, but subtle differences in community assemblages associated with shifts in intertidal plant community were detected. This work demonstrates that impacts of species range expansions are far-reaching due to connectivity in marine systems.

AB  - Chemistry of porewaters and soils were compared in a low organic matter (1%) created marsh established on an upland site in 1983 and a high organic matter (almost-equal-to 50%) natural marsh nearby to characterize the role of created wetlands in estuarine nutrient cycles. Porewater physico-chemical properties (water level, temperature, salinity, dissolved O2, pH, redox potential (Eh), Fe, Mn) and nutrient (organic C, N, P, NH4, NO3, PO,) concentrations were monitored monthly for 1 yr in the two marshes. Soil nutrients (organic C, N, P), physical properties (bulk density, texture, porosity, hydraulic conductivity) and chemical characteristics (Eh, pH, Fe, Mn, Al) also were measured at the end of the study. 5 yr after emergent vegetation was established, the conversion from upland porewater and soil properties to typical wetland characteristics was incomplete. Dissolved O2, Eh, Fe, Mn and NO3-N were significantly higher in created marsh porewaters as compared to porewaters collected from the natural marsh. The created marsh also contained lower porewater dissolved organic C and N, NH4-N and PO4-P and had lower pH. Soil bulk density and extractable Fe were significantly higher, and porosity, hydraulic conductivity, pH, total organic C and N, and exchangeable NH4-N and NO3-N were lower in the created marsh than in the natural marsh soil. These results imply that mitigation of wetland disturbance by creating wetlands on graded upland sites, initially, may not duplicate the hydrologic and nutrient cycling functions associated with natural wetlands that have developed over many years.

AB  - Bacterioplankton abundance and activity were studied in the estuarine system of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) to test if tidal resuspension of sediments and transport of particles from the salt marshes may act as factors of variability of bacterial communities. The total and attached cell abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and the heterotrophic metabolism of glucose, as well as seston, chlorophyll alpha and particulate organic carbon (POC) were monitored during four 10-h periods along the tidal cycle at four sampling sites across a transect. The variation of particulate materials (seston, POC and chlorophyll alpha) along the transect was not significantly correlated with either distance to the margin or distance to the sediment surface. Nevertheless, proximity to the salt marsh or to the bottom sediment surface favoured glucose incorporation and aminopeptidase activity. A multiple stepwise linear regression analysis using temperature, salinity, seston, POC, chlorophyll a, distance to sediment surface and distance to the margin as independent variables explained 66.5% of the variability of the fraction of particle-attached bacteria and only a very small proportion (12-43%) of the observed variability of total bacterial abundance, ectoenzymatic activity and glucose utilization. The spatial patterns of variation of the concentration of particulate material (seston, POC and chlorophyll alpha) do not clearly indicate the occurrence of sediment resuspension and runoff from the margins. This, together with the poor contribution of these parameters to the transversal and tidal variability of bacterial activity, dismisses the importance of inputs of suspended material across the sediment/water interface and from neighbouring salt marshes in the control of bacterial density and activity.

AB  - Several studies of salt marsh systems have attempted to quantify the flow of organic matter between the land and coastal waters. However, the techniques used could not identify sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) rapidly assimilated by heterothrophic bacteria. Recently, the assay of carbon isotopy ratios has allowed characterization of the different sources of organic matter in salt marshes. In this study, we wanted to find out if the natural isotopic composition assayed in heterotrophic bacteria distinguished the origin of bioavailable DOC. We determined th delta(13)C values for 1) three bacterial strains and their nucleic acids cultured on glucose and tryptose substrates, respectively, and 2) naturally occurring bacteria recovered from seawater in which salt marsh vegetation had been immersed. First, we showed that the isotopic fractionation was the same for the three bacterial stains cultured on the same synthetic substrate, but could vary depending on the nature of DOC. There was no significant difference between the delta(13)C values of bacteria and their nucleic acids. Second, natural bacteria were grown in a medium enriched in DOC from halophytic plants. The delta(13)C values of this community were close to those of dissolved organic carbon from plant leachates. The comparison between the isotopic ratios of natural bacteria in Vibrio alginolyticus showed that the heterogeneity of the bacterial community averaged the isotopic fractionation from the preferential assimilation of organic compounds in the medium by each bacterial strain. The delta(13)C values rcorded for the bacgerial community in the field and their nucleic acids made it possible to identify the source of organic matter readily accessible to microorganisms in a coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Coastal waters are severely threatened by nitrogen (N) loading from direct groundwater discharge. The subterranean estuary, the mixing zone of fresh groundwater and sea water in a coastal aquifer, has a high potential to remove substantial N. A network of piezometers was used to characterize the denitrification capacity and groundwater flow paths in the subterranean estuary below a Rhode Island fringing salt marsh. "N-enriched nitrate was injected into the subterranean estuary (in situ push-pull method) to evaluate the denitrification capacity of the saturated zone at multiple depths (125300 cm) below different zones (upland-marsh transition zone, high marsh, and low marsh). From the upland to low marsh, the water table became shallower, groundwater dissolved oxygen decreased, and groundwater pH, soil organic carbon, and total root biomass increased. As groundwater approached the high and low marsh, the hydraulic gradient increased and deep groundwater upwelled. In the warm season (groundwater temperature > 12 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity within each zone was observed. The warm season low marsh groundwater denitrification capacity was significantly higher than all other zones and depths. In the cool season (groundwater temperature < 10.5 degrees C), elevated groundwater denitrification capacity was only found in the low marsh. Additions of dissolved organic carbon did not alter groundwater denitrification capacity suggesting that an alternative electron donor, possibly transported by tidal inundation from the root zone, may be limiting. Combining flow paths with denitrification capacity and saturated porewater residence time, we estimated that as much as 29-60 mg N could be removed from 11 of water flowing through the subterranean estuary below the low marsh, arguing for the significance of subterranean estuaries in annual watershed scale N budgets.

AB  - Accretion rate in salt marshes is governed by inorganic soil deposition and soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Existing (limited) observations and modeling results suggest that SOM amounts, biomass production, and decomposition processes should vary widely and systematically at the marsh scale. However, we lack observations aimed at understanding how SOM production is modulated spatially within a marsh, and at elucidating the relative importance of the controlling processes. The little existing data suggest that competing effects between biomass production and decomposition processes determine an approximately spatially constant contribution of SOM to total accretion. Here we investigate this idea using concurrent observations of SOM and decomposition rates from marshes in North Carolina. Our results indicate that systematic spatial variations in SOM are small, possibly as a result of an at least partial compensation of opposing trends in biomass production and decomposed organic matter. Our analyses show that deeper soil layers are, on average, characterized by lower decomposition rates and higher stabilization factors than shallower layers, likely because of differences in the persistence of water-logged conditions. Overall, decomposition processes are sufficiently rapid that the labile material in the fresh biomass is completely decomposed before it can be sufficiently buried and stabilized. Our findings point to the importance of the fraction of initially refractory material and of stabilization processes in determining the final distribution of SOM within the soil column.

AB  - 1. Climatic warming can change how coastal wetland plants grow, thus altering their capacity to build land and keep pace with rising seas. As freeze events decline with climate change, mangroves expand their range to higher latitudes and displace salt marsh vegetation. Warmer air temperatures will likely alter above- and below-ground plant dynamics as this dramatic coastal wetland biome shift proceeds, which in turn may result in changes in ecosystem function such as sediment building.
   2. We used a large scale in situ warming experiment in a subtropical wetland to increase both marsh and mangrove ecosystem air temperatures. We assessed how 2 years of continuous warming influenced above- and below-ground plant growth and surface elevation relative to sea level.
   3. We found that chronic warming doubled plant height and accelerated the expansion of mangrove into salt marsh vegetation, as indicated by a sixfold greater increase in mangrove cover in warmed plots compared to ambient temperature plots and a corresponding loss in salt marsh cover. Surface elevation gain, a measure of soil-building capacity, increased due to warming over a 2-year period and these changes in surface elevation were driven by increased mangrove root production in warmed plots.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that, in some coastal wetlands, warming can facilitate plant community changes from marsh to mangrove, with corresponding increases in growth that help coastal wetlands to keep pace with sea-level rise.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to study the effect of plants common in temperate latitudes (Zostera noltii, Spartina maritima and Scirpus maritimus) on sediment nutrient profiles, and to compare it to sand- and mud-flats without vegetation. The study focused on the organic matter contents, the concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO4-P, NH3-N, NO3-N), an on the estimation of the total amount of these nutrients during day and night conditions and their potential net-fluxes. It was also hypothesised that in an estuarine system, different plants may have specific effects, and consequently different contributions to the system nutrient dynamics as a whole. Sediment profiles of loss on ignition (LOI) showed an increase of the organic matter contents from sand-flat, to Zostera, Spartina, mud-flat and Scirpus. Statistically, there were significant differences between sediment profiles of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), during day and night periods. These results suggest that there is an intense mobility of nutrients in the sediment, showing a day-night variation of nutrient concentrations in the pore-water. In the plants' rhizosphere, the day-night variation of nutrients seemed dependent on plant biomass and penetration of the roots. Additionally, coupling between plant and sediment seems to be a species-specific process. In spring, Scirpus salt marsh reaches the maximum density and biomass, and despite the higher organic matter contents in the plant covered sediment, Scirpus acts as a sink of nutrients. In contrast, the top 10 cm of the sediment in the Spartina salt marsh and in the Zostera beds may contribute to the efflux of nutrients during the night period, especially phosphate.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly studying carbon (C) storage by natural ecosystems for climate mitigation, including coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems. Unfortunately, little guidance on how to achieve robust, cost-effective estimates of blue C stocks to inform inventories exists. We use existing data (492 cores) to develop recommendations on the sampling effort required to achieve robust estimates of blue C. Using a broad-scale, spatially explicit dataset from Victoria, Australia, we applied multiple spatial methods to provide guidelines for reducing variability in estimates of soil C stocks over large F. areas. With a separate dataset collected across Australia, we evaluated how many samples are needed to capture variability within soil cores and the best methods for extrapolating C to 1 m soil depth. We found that 40 core samples are optimal for capturing C variance across 1000's of kilometres but higher density sampling is required across finer scales (100-200 km). Accounting for environmental variation can further decrease required sampling. The within core analyses showed that nine samples within a core capture the majority of the variability and log-linear equations can accurately extrapolate C. These recommendations can help develop standardized methods for sampling programmes to quantify soil C stocks at national scales.

AB  - The effect of grazing by large herbivores on the microbial community and the ecosystem functions they provide are relatively unknown in grassland systems. In this study, the impact of grazing upon the size, composition and activity of the soil microbial community was measured in field experiments in two coastal ecosystems: one salt marsh and one sand dune grassland. Bacterial, fungal and total microbial biomass were not systematically affected by grazing across ecosystems, although, within an ecosystem, differences could be detected. Fungal-to-bacterial ratio did not differ with grazing for either habitat. Redundancy analysis showed that soil moisture, bulk density and root biomass significantly explained the composition of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers, dominated by the distinction between the two grassland habitats, but where the grazing effect could also be resolved. PLFA markers for Gram-positive bacteria were more proportionally abundant in un-grazed, and markers for Gram-negative bacteria in grazed grasslands. Bacterial growth rate (leucine incorporation) was highest in un-grazed salt marsh but did not vary with grazing intensity in the sand dune grassland. We conclude that grazing consistently affects the composition of the soil microbial community in semi-natural grasslands but that its influence is small (7 % of the total variation in PLFA composition), compared with differences between grassland types (89 %). The relatively small effect of grazing translated to small effects on measurements of soil microbial functions, including N and C mineralisation. This study is an early step toward assessing consequences of land-use change for global nutrient cycles driven by the microbial community.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the patterns of exchanges of nutrients and suspended sediments between the sea and a polder, after partial tidal restoration, and to assess if these are comparable to those observed in natural salt marshes. The study site, situated in the Bay of Veys, in Northwestern France, was embanked in the 1870s and accidentally reconnected to the sea in 1990. Water now flows in and out of the polder by a single communication point with the sea, which facilitated water sampling and flux calculation for dissolved and particulate elements.
   The study was carried out for two years, from May 2002 to April 2004. Results showed that for all the months studied the water flowing out of the polder had lower concentrations of nitrates and suspended sediments, which lead to a retention of these elements throughout the year. Nitrates uptakes in the polder were much higher in winter (up to 473.9 g N ha(-1) tide(-1)) than in summer where they were close to zero. The retention of suspended sediment could be over 80% of the import and was mainly composed of organic matter. Finally, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon were higher in outflow than inflow water, but due to unbalanced water budgets this lead to low quantities imported in summer and higher amounts exported for all other seasons. No interpretable pattern was observed for ammonium.
   The nature of these fluxes, according to literature, is close to those observed in immature salt marshes, so as far as restoration is concerned, it has been shown that partial tidal restoration can allow the restitution of the salt marsh exchange functions that were studied.

AB  - A conceptual framework is presented to portray how Fe, S and other elements (Ca, Si, K) are geologically and pedologically cycled between minerals that are formed and are stable in land-based aerobic environments and those that are formed and are stable in anaerobic sea-based environments. Foremost among the elements discussed are Fe and S, which cycle between Fe sulfides, formed by sulfidization in the anaerobic sea-based environments of tidal marsh and subaqueous soils and sediments, and Fe oxides and jarosite, formed by sulfuricization in upland soils upon the exposure of the sulfide-mineral bearing sediments to oxidizing conditions. Some results of previously conducted experiments are presented to demonstrate that Fe oxides placed in the sea-based anaerobic tidal marsh and subaqueous soils are rapidly transformed to Fe sulfides - apparently by the reduction of Fe3+ by sulfide of H2S, generated from sulfate of sea water with the oxidized form of S serving as the electron acceptor during the oxidation of organic matter. Documentation of rapid sulfuricization of sulfidic materials to form sulfuric horizons upon exposure to aerobic conditions is also presented. Ca from sea water, biologically precipitated as calcite and aragonite in shells of organisms that thrive in brackish sea-influenced environments is sometimes transformed temporarily, before dissolution and leaching of the Ca and sulfate, into gypsum by sulfuricization in uplands when the shells are present in exposed sulfidic materials. Silica is also released from silicate minerals during sulfuricization, which can reprecipitate as opal-CT, to cause cementation of soil materials into duripan-like formations. In the geologic past, opal (in the form of diatoms) and glauconite formed in Tertiary-age geologic sediments under marine conditions, to become part of the parent materials for upland active and post-active acid sulfate soils of the present time. Modern formation of glauconite in subaqueous soils and shallow sediments has not been found, but the topic needs further investigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal fresh marshes are at least as productive as nearby salt marshes, but much less is known about controls on primary production in tidal fresh vs. salt marshes. We studied a tidal fresh marsh in Georgia, U.S.A., dominated by the C-3 grass Zizaniopsis miliacea. We documented seasonal variation in Z. miliacea above-ground biomass and below-ground macro-organic matter over 1 yr, and annual variation in end-of-season aboveground biomass over 15 yr in creekbank and midmarsh zones. Aboveground biomass showed a distinct peak in July and October. Belowground macro-organic matter was much greater than aboveground biomass and peaked in October. Overall productivity was similar to that of salt marshes downstream. Z. miliacea end-of-season above-ground biomass showed a classic hump-shaped "subsidy-stress" relationship with plot elevation, but on average the creekbank supported about twofold more above-ground biomass than the midmarsh, and both zones varied in biomass about 1.7-fold among years. Annual variation in above-ground biomass was negatively correlated with maximum and mean temperature in both zones, and positively with river discharge in the creekbank zone. Sea level, precipitation and water column salinity showed biologically plausible trends with respect to biomass. The responses of Z. miliacea to abiotic drivers were muted compared with the responses of nearby salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Temperature was more important for Z. miliacea, whereas drivers of porewater salinity were more important in the salt marsh. Likely future changes in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge may pose a threat to the high productivity of tidal fresh marshes.

AB  - The distribution of major elements and trace metals has been studied in two radiodated salt marsh sediment cores (core K and core E) of the Scheldt estuary, in order to determine the recent pollution history and to assess the impact of diagenetic processes. The sedimentation rates, based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 inventories, were 0.84-0.90 cm/yr in core E and 1.3-1.7 cm/yr in core K. The sediments show a vertical redox zonation with an oxic upper layer, where trace metals are mobilized, overlying a reduced layer where the metals are precipitated. Though these diagenetic processes have greatly modified the original trace metal distribution, anthropogenic maxima could be identified for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn during the mid-sixties. A second pollution maximum was found at the end of the seventies for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The down-core distributions of Mn, Fe, total S, CaCO3, Sr, Co, and Ni are controlled by diagenetic processes, whereas the P profiles reflect both anthropogenic and diagenetic impacts.
   Rapid remobilization of trace metals occurs after their deposition on the marshes due to the occurrence of oxic conditions in the upper sediment layer, preventing precipitation of metal sulfides from the pore waters. Though the metals are partly reprecipitated in the reduced sediment layer (e.g. as sulfides), the inventory of the cores suggests that Cr is the only metal which is completely retained by the sediments. Slight losses are observed for Fe, Co, and Pb (11-14%), moderate losses for Zn, Cu, and Ni (19-25%), and high losses for P, Mn, and Cd (40-50%). Similar mobilization of trace metals is to be expected in other salt marshes if a distinct oxic sediment layer is present.

AB  - Deepwater Horizon was the largest marine oil spill in U.S. waters, oiling large expanses of coastal wetland shorelines. We compared marsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata) density and shell length at salt marsh sites with heavy oiling to reference conditions similar to 16 months after oiling. We also compared periwinkle density and size among oiled sites with and without shoreline cleanup treatments. Densities of periwinkles were reduced by 80-90% at the oiled marsh edge and by 50% in the oiled marsh interior (similar to 9 m inland) compared to reference, with greatest numerical losses of periwinkles in the marsh interior, where densities were naturally higher. Shoreline cleanup further reduced adult snail density as well as snail size. Based on the size of adult periwinkles observed coupled with age and growth information, population recovery is projected to take several years once oiling and habitat conditions in affected areas are suitable to support normal periwinkle life-history functions. Where heavily oiled marshes have experienced accelerated erosion as a result of the spill, these habitat impacts would represent additional losses of periwinkles. Losses of marsh periwinkles would likely affect other ecosystem processes and attributes, including organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food chains, and multiple species that prey on periwinkles.

AB  - Undisturbed natural wetlands are considered carbon sequesters because of their high primary productivity and low soil microbial respiration (SMR). Tidal wetlands in Yangtze River Estuary are typical and impermanent original ecological coastal salt marshes, and their carbon sequestration functions are of great significance to the balance of carbon emissions from Shanghai. Global warming and its associated effects comprise one of the most serious environmental problems humans are currently facing. To analyze changes in the SMR of tidal wetlands in the Yangtze River Estuary in response to global warming and the associated increase in sea level, a simulation study was conducted in the laboratory. The results show that when organic input is limited, increasing temperature can lead to an initial sharp increase in SMR, but that the SMR reverts to its original level with time even becomes lower. Overall, increasing the temperature does not have a significant effect on SMR because organic input is limited under these conditions. Increasing sea level can accelerate SMR and beta-glucosidase activity, but this effect is not significant. This may occur because more nutrients are input by the tide, which facilitates SMR by attenuating the disadvantage associated with the anaerobic environment caused by prolonged water logging. However, synergistic effect of increased temperature and sea level lead to an obvious acceleration in SMR and beta-glucosidase activity. In tidal soil in which the soil nutrient levels are low, organic matter input is found to be the dominant factor affecting SMR and microbial activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the factors which control metal and As phytoavailability in the different microenvironments (Sand Dunes, Salt Flat, Dry River and Shrubs) present at a Mediterranean salt marsh polluted by mining wastes. We performed a field study following a plot sampling survey. The analyses of soil parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon contents, etc.), total metal and As concentrations and their phytoavailability assessed with EDTA were related to each microenvironment and the corresponding plant species uptake. The averages of pH and EC were slightly alkaline (pH approximate to 7.5) and saline approximate to 2.2 to 17.1 dS m(-1)) respectively. The soil samples from the Salt Flat subzone showed the highest metal concentrations (e.g. 51 mg kg(-1) Cd, 11,600 mg kg(-1) Pb) while for As, the highest concentrations occurred in the Dry River (380 mg kg(-1) As). The total metal and EDTA-extractable concentrations occurred as it follows: Salt Flat > Dry River > Degraded Dunes > Shrubs. In relation to plant metal and As accumulation, the highest root concentrations were obtained in the species from the Salt Flat subzone: similar to 17 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 620 mg kg(-1) Pb, for both, Juncus maritimus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. However the highest metal and As shoot concentrations occurred in species from the Sand Dunes: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As similar to 270 mg kg(-1) Pb for Dittrichia viscosa: similar to 23 mg kg(-1) As, similar to 390 mg kg(-1) Zn for Crucianella maritima. The occurrence of edaphic gradients including salinity and texture determined the vegetation distribution. However, it cannot be concluded that there was a disturbance due to metal(loid)s soil concentrations in terms of vegetation composition except in the Degraded Dunes and Dry River. The higher EDTA-extractable concentrations were coincidental with the most saline soils but this did not result in higher metal(loid)s plant accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Primary producer (angiosperms, macroalgae, submerged aquatic vegetation), suspended particulate matter, and Fundulus heteroclitus isotope values (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34) were examined to assess their use as indicators for changes in food web support functions in tidally-restored salt marshes. Study sites, located throughout the southern New England region (USA), ranged from Spartina atterniflora-dominated reference marshes, marshes under various regimes and histories of tide restoration, and a severely tide-restricted Phragmites australis marsh. Fundulus delta C-13 values were greater for fish from reference Spartina marshes than for fish from adjacent tide-restricted or tide-restored marshes where higher percent cover of C-3 plants, lower water column salinities, and more negative dissolved inorganic delta C-13 values were observed. The difference in Fundulus delta C-15 values between a tide-restricted Phragmites marsh and an adjacent reference Spartina marsh was great compared to the difference between marshes at various stages of tide restoration and their respective reference marshes, suggesting that food web support functions are restored as the degree of tidal restriction is lessened. While a multiple isotopic approach can provide valuable information for determining specific food sources to consumers, this study demonstrates that monitoring Fundulus delta C-13 values alone may be useful to evaluate the trajectory of ecological change for marshes undergoing tidal restoration.

AB  - The Neponset River Estuary is a small, tidally dominated urban system that is fringed with Spartina spp. salt marsh and drains the second largest river into Boston Harbor, MA, High-resolution measurements of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were taken with a towed instrument package, the MiniShuttle, to explore tidal and seasonal variations in the sources and distributions of CDOM in the estuary. A mid-estuary source of CDOM was apparent on all surveys representing 10-50% of the freshwater CDOM source to the system. Presumably this source results from the degradation of salt marsh derived organic matter within the estuary. The strength of this source peaked in late summer, an observation that is consistent with this interpretation. Two-dimensional (tow-yo) data shows that the constricting Granite Avenue Bridge displays a major influence on circulation in the estuary. Further, large-scale tidal mixing and variations in the freshwater endmember on the time scale of hours make interpretations difficult. High-resolution measurements show that a fluctuating freshwater endmember and a constant CDOM source from the fringing salt marsh during August, 2002 are consistent with observations.

AB  - The cycling of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the role of tidal marshes in estuarine DIC dynamics were studied in a Virginia tidal freshwater marsh and adjacent estuary. DIC was measured over diurnal cycles in different seasons in a marsh tidal creek and at the junction of the creek with the adjacent Pamunkey River. In the creek, DIC concentrations around high tide were controlled by the same processes affecting whole-estuary DIC gradients. Near low tide, DIC concentrations were 1.5-5-fold enriched relative to high tide concentrations, indicating an input of DIC from the marsh. Similar patterns (although dampened in magnitude) were observed at the creek mouth and indicated that DIC was exported from the marsh. Marsh pore-water DIC concentrations were up to 5 mmol L-1 greater than those in the creek and suggested a significant input of sediment pore water to the creek. A model of tidal marsh DIC export showed that, on a seasonal basis, DIC export rates were influenced by water temperature. The composition of exported DIC averaged 19% dissolved CO2 and 81% HCO3- and CO32-. Although CO2 can be lost to the atmosphere during transit through the estuary DIC in the form of carbonate alkalinity is subject to export from the estuary to the coastal ocean. When extrapolated to an estuarywide scale, the export of marsh-derived DIC to the York River estuary explained a significant portion (47 +/- 23%) of excess DIC production (i.e., DIC in excess of that expected from conservative mixing between seawater and freshwater and equilibrium with the atmosphere) in this system. Therefore, CO2 supersaturation, by itself, does not indicate that an estuary is net heterotrophic.

AB  - Measurements of nitrogen, organic carbon and delta(13)C are presented for Spartina-dominated marsh sediments from a mineral marsh in SW Netherlands and from a peaty marsh in Massachusetts, U.S.A. delta(13)C Of organic carbon in the peaty marsh sediments is similar to that of Spartina material, whereas that in mineral marshes is depleted by 9-12 parts per thousand. It is argued that this depletion in delta(13)C of organic matter in marsh sediments is due to trapping of allochthonous organic matter which is depleted in C-13. The isotopic composition and concentration of organic carbon are used in a simple mass balance to constrain the amount of plant material accumulating in marsh sediments, i.e. in terms of the so-called net ecosystem production. Net ecosystem production (similar to 2-100 g C m(-2) year(-1)) is a small fraction (1-5%) of plant production (similar to 2000 g C m(-2) year(-1)). This small amount of plant material being preserved is nevertheless sufficient to support marsh-accretion rates similar to the rate of sea-level rise. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Water extracts from soils of the Barents Sea coast (the Khaipudyr Bay) were analyzed for the contents of organic carbon and total nitrogen by the method of high-temperature catalytic oxidation with non-dispersive IR registration; the contents of low-molecular-weight acids, carbohydrates, and alcohols were determined by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass-spectrometry. The mass fraction of inorganic carbon (HCO3-) was measured potentiometrically, and the content of inorganic nitrogen (N-NO3-, N-NH4+) was determined by photometry. In marsh soils (Tidalic Fluvisols (Arenic or Loamic, Epiprotosalic)), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 0.1-0.8, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.01-0.05 g/kg, omega(N-org)(H2O) = 0.06 omega(C-org)(H2O) + 0.01, and (C/N)(H2O) = 7-21. The content of individual components does not exceed 20 mg/kg, including carbohydrates (50-90%), acids (10-50%), and alcohols (<3%). In peat horizons of tundra soils (Cryic Histosols and Histic Cryosols), omega(C-org)(H2O) = 4-10, omega(N-org)(H2O) similar to and (C/N)(H2O) = 25-56. Litter and peat horizons accumulate both individual humus components and total dissolved organic carbon. The total weight of the identified substances is 200300 mg/kg, 80-90% of them are carbohydrates, 10-20% are acids, and 0-9% are alcohols. The accumulation of (C-org)(H2O) and (N-NH4+)(H2O) takes place above the permafrost table. It is argued that the ratios of organic forms of carbon and nitrogen in soil water extracts and the content of low-molecular weight organic compounds in soils can be used as indicators of pedogenic processes in the Far North.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of low-tide rainfall on salt marsh particulate organic carbon (POC) cycling. Suspended sediment samples from intertidal creeks were collected during rain and no-rain conditions. Bulk (carbon, nitrogen) and molecular (e.g., lignin) compositions of organic constituents in particulates were analyzed. Temporal patterns of suspended sediment concentration mimic fluctuations in rainfall intensity, but all POC constituents do not necessarily follow these patterns. For example, particulate organic matter concentrations in water column covaried with rain intensity yet organic matter (OM) contents in the particles showed trivial correlations with rain. In general, rainfall effects raised the suspended sediment and organic constituent concentrations in the water column by up to three orders of magnitude. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the rainfall-entrained particulates were compositionally distinct from calm weather suspended particulates, from salt marsh surface sediment, and from creek bank surface sediment. Rainfall-entrained particulates are depleted in bulk organic carbon and phytoplankton-derived OM but enriched in lignin phenols. These observations indicate that rainfall-runoff processes preferentially mobilize POC derived from Spartina alterniflora from marsh platforms and effectively transport these materials to intertidal creeks following low-tide rainfall events. Moreover, average net transport rates by rainfall are 0.020 +/- 0.002 gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1), and this POC turnover rate amounts to similar to 19% of the annual POC export from estuary to ocean. Therefore, estuarine outwelling estimates typically made under calm weather conditions represent minimum levels of POC export. Hence, low-tide rainfall can be expected to substantially enhance the delivery of marsh-derived POC to the coastal ocean.

AB  - Microalgae may contribute more to salt marsh productivity than realized, underscoring the importance of understanding algal dynamics in such systems. Benthic and planktonic chlorophyll-a (surrogate for total algal biomass), sediment ash-free dry weight, total suspended solids, salinity, and nutrients were examined in intermittently connected marsh ponds in the subtropical Guadalupe Estuary, Texas, USA to determine the effects of hydrologic connections on algal biomass in this system. From May 2005 to May 2006, several high water events resulting in surface water connections between ponds and nearby tidal creeks occurred, followed by disconnection and, at times, pond desiccation. During periods of disconnection, algal biomass was higher in both the benthos and the water column than during connection events when flushing occurred. Since connection events did not increase NO., the primary source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen seemed to be nutrient. cycling within the ponds. Data at the aggregated level, i.e., chlorophyll-a, indicated this system followed the flood pulse concept. During high water events, algal biomass may be exported to supplement the tidal creek food web (aquatic), whereas during low water events accumulated biomass within the ponds feed the marsh food web (terrestrial), which includes blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and the whooping crane (Grus americana).

AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr(-1), which is similar to 30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modeling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.

AB  - The balance between nitrate respiration pathways, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (DNRA), determines whether bioavailable nitrogen is removed as N-2 gas or recycled as ammonium. Saltwater intrusion and organic matter enrichment may increase sulphate reduction leading to sulphide accumulation. We investigated the effects of sulphide on the partitioning of NO3- between complete denitrification and DNRA and the microbial communities in salt marsh sediments. Complete denitrification significantly decreased with increasing sulphide, resulting in an increase in the contribution of DNRA to NO3- respiration. Alternative fates of NO3- became increasingly important at higher sulphide treatments, which could include N2O production and/or transport into intracellular vacuoles. Higher 16S transcript diversity was observed in the high sulphide treatment, with clear shifts in composition. Generally, low and no sulphide, coupled with high NO3-, favoured the activity of Campylobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Altermonadales, all of which include opportunistic denitrifiers. High n-ary sumation sulphide conditions promoted the activity of potential sulphide oxidizing nitrate reducers (Desulfobulbaceae, Acidiferrobacteraceae and Xanthomonadales) and sulphate reducers (Desulfomonadaceae, Desulfobacteraceae). Our study highlights the tight coupling between N and S cycling, and the implications of these dynamics on the fate of bioavailable N in coastal environments susceptible to intermittent saltwater inundation and organic matter enrichment.

AB  - Environmental perturbations in wetlands affect the integrated plant-microbial-soil system, causing biogeochemical responses that can manifest at local to global scales. The objective of this study was to determine how saltwater intrusion affects carbon mineralization and greenhouse gas production in coastal wetlands. Working with tidal freshwater marsh soils that had experienced similar to 3.5 yr of in situ saltwater additions, we quantified changes in soil properties, measured extracellular enzyme activity associated with organic matter breakdown, and determined potential rates of anaerobic carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production. Soils from the field plots treated with brackish water had lower carbon content and higher C : N ratios than soils from freshwater plots, indicating that saltwater intrusion reduced carbon availability and increased organic matter recalcitrance. This was reflected in reduced activities of enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of cellulose and the oxidation of lignin, leading to reduced rates of soil CO2 and CH4 production. The effects of long-term saltwater additions contrasted with the effects of short-term exposure to brackish water during three-day laboratory incubations, which increased rates of CO2 production but lowered rates of CH4 production. Collectively, our data suggest that the long-term effect of saltwater intrusion on soil CO2 production is indirect, mediated through the effects of elevated salinity on the quantity and quality of autochthonous organic matter inputs to the soil. In contrast, salinity, organic matter content, and enzyme activities directly influence CH4 production. Our analyses demonstrate that saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater marshes affects the entire process of carbon mineralization, from the availability of organic carbon through its terminal metabolism to CO2 and/or CH4, and illustrate that long-term shifts in biogeochemical functioning are not necessarily consistent with short-term disturbance-type responses.

AB  - Coastal wetlands accumulate soil carbon more efficiently than terrestrial systems, but sea-level rise potentially threatens the persistence of this prominent carbon sink. Here, we combine a published dataset of 372 soil carbon accumulation rates from across the United States with new analysis of 131 sites in coastal Louisiana and find that the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) explains 80% of regional variation in carbon accumulation. A carbon mass balance for the rapidly submerging Louisiana coast demonstrates that carbon accumulation rates in surviving marshes increase with RSLR and currently exceed the rate of carbon loss due to marsh drowning and erosion. Although continued erosion will eventually lead to net carbon loss, our results suggest a strong negative carbon-climate feedback for coastal marshes, where even submerging marshes sequester carbon at rates that increase with RSLR.

AB  - Belowground biomass of Spartina alterniflora lost 55% of its organic matter during 18 months of decomposition in salt-marsh sediments. Significant losses of lignin were observed under highly reducing conditions confirming previous reports of lignin degradation in the absence of molecular oxygen. The submolecular components of lignin varied in susceptibility to degradation and were ranked in the following descending order of resistance to decomposition: V is similar to P > S is similar to C. The preferential degradation of the cinnamyl and syringyl components constrains the quantitative usefulness of these compounds for estimating the contributions of herbaceous and angiosperm tissues to pools of dissolved and particulate organic matter. The relative concentration of lignin increased about 1.6-fold during decomposition owing to the more rapid loss of polysaccharides.
   Two phases in nitrogen dynamics were evident during the decomposition study. During the first 4 months of decomposition there was a net loss of N from Spartina tissues at a rate of about 10-mu-g N g-1 tissue d-1. After this initial phase of net N loss, a phase of N immobilization was evident and was tightly coupled with rates of microbial degradation of the tissues. Net rates of N immobilization were approximately 19-mu-g N g-1 tissue d-1; by the end of the 18-month study more N had accumulated in the tissues than was initially present. Stable N isotope compositions of decaying Spartina were also very dynamic and reflected the sources of N that were immobilized during decomposition and the N transformations that occurred on the detrital particles.
   The stable C isotope composition of the polysaccharide components of Spartina was approximately 6 parts per thousand heavier than that of the lignin component. The isotopic compositions of these components retained the 6 parts-per-thousand difference throughout the 18-month study. The stable C isotope composition of the bulk tissues, however, decreased gradually during decomposition as the isotopically heavier polysaccharides were preferentially lost. Residual material was relatively enriched in the isotopically lighter, lignin-derived C.

AB  - Reclamation in coastal zones is effective for relieving population pressure and ensuring food safety. Since the 1950s, the development of coastal zones has entered a peak period. At present, the reclamation of coastal zones mainly occurs in developing countries. The coastal reclaimed lands are mainly used for agricultural production, urban and industrial development, and port construction. The scale and scope of reclamation in coastal lands are larger than in interior lands, and pose substantial environmental risks. This review summarizes the trends in soil physicochemical property evolution following reclamation in salt marshes from around the world. The following important conclusions were obtained: physicochemical properties of coastal saline soils (CSSs) significantly improved over the long term following reclamation in Eastern Asia. Long term fertilization and cultivation resulted in modified soil structure [an increase in the proportion of macroaggregates (>250 mu m) and silt (0.002-0.05 mm)], enhancing the capacity for preserving fertility and C sequestration. Reclamation significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and soil properties approached a relatively stable level nearly 30 years after reclamation, especially in Eastern Asia. However, in Europe and North America, SOM in coastal reclaimed soils (CRSs) decreased rapidly after reclamation, and soil acidification was also a severe problem during reclamation. Coastal reclamation could significantly increase soil GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions, further affecting global C cycle. Microbial biomass and activity as well as activities of related enzymes increased gradually in CRS in Eastern Asia, in particular the activities of urease and phosphatase involved in nutrient cycling. In general, physicochemical properties of CRS in Eastern Asia tend to modify, but deteriorate in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, offshore eutrophication, soil heavy metal and organic pollutant concentrations, and salt marsh ecosystem degradation were the most serious environmental risks posed by coastal reclamation. Some strategies to alleviate these risks are put forward. In this review, we also identified priority areas of future research on CRS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - NaCl and Na2SO4 are the key factors affecting nitrogen (N) mineralization in the soil of estuarine wetlands. However, it remains unclear how N mineralization responses to NaCl and Na2SO4. In the present study, samples of topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (10-20 cm) were collected in three marshes, including a Phragmites australis marsh (Pa-marsh), a Suaeda salsa marsh (Ss-marsh) and a mudflat marsh (Mu-marsh), in the Liaohe River estuary. The soil samples were treated by NaCl and Na2SO4, with a set of salinity levels of 0 %Es, 2 %Es, 5 %Es, 10 %Es, 20 %Es and 100 %Es (%Es, percent of equivalent seawater), respectively. After incubating the soil samples for 2 weeks, the contents of NH4+-N and NO3--N were measured and the net N mineralization rates (R-min) were calculated. We found that NH4+-N and NO3--N accumulations in the soil samples of the three marshes in the NaCl and Na2SO4 treatments. Both NaCl and Na2SO4 significantly affected R-min for the top soil for Pa-marsh in all salinity treatments, whereas salt-effects for Ss- and Mu-marsh soils were only found at 10 %Es and/or 20 %Es levels in the NaCl treatments. There was an ion-specific effect of NaCl and Na2SO4 on N mineralization. NaCl increased R-min by 114-164% and 86-139% in the topsoil and subsoil of the three marshes, respectively; Na2SO4 increased R-min by 234% in the topsoil of Pa-marsh and had no effect on R-min in the other soils. A salt threshold of 50-60%Es was found for NaCl and Na2SO4 impacting on N mineralization of Pa-marsh soil. Salt type, salinity level, wetland type and soil layer were the main factors impacting the N mineralization. The results suggest that the effect of salt on N mineralization could vary with salt type and soil properties.

AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Halimione portulacoides was evaluated by analysing the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in sediment pore waters from a salt marsh at different depths. Cores of sediments at colonized and non-colonized sites were collected from a coastal lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal). The DOC content of extracted pore waters was determined and characterized by synchronous molecular fluorescence (Delta lambda = 60 nm) and UV-visible spectroscopies. The common practice of freezing sediment cores for further and later chemical investigation was shown not to be an appropriate methodology of sample preservation. On the contrary, freezing of extracted and filtered pore water seemed not to affect either the DOC content or the fluorescence properties of pore waters. Two types of fluorescent substances were found in the pore waters spectra; one corresponding to humic-like substances and another one resembling proteins. However, major differences were found in the spectra of pore waters depending on both depth and the presence/absence of vegetation colonization. (c) 2006 Ellsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental changes during the last 2 millennia in the Minho River tidal marsh (NW Portugal-Spain border) were reconstructed. Changes in the sources of organic matter (OM) delivered to the marsh were evaluated from elemental, isotopic and molecular composition using a 1 m sediment core. Carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C-org/N) provided valuable information concerning the origin of the OM. These parameters indicated a major input from land plants, reaching a maximum at 1100-1200 and 1750-1850 AD. These periods match with major flood events in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, as reported by several authors. A significant reduction in the terrestrial signature occurred at 6-4 cm (ca. 1960-1985 AD), which is contemporaneous with the construction of several major dams on the Minho River. The distribution of selected lipid biomarkers, including n-alkanes, n-fatty acids and n-alkan-2-ones and specific parameters derived from the molecular distributions, were useful for refining bulk geochemical results. Long chain n-alkanes with an odd number of carbons are indicators of soil-and vascular plant-derived terrestrial OM and were dominant throughout the core. In addition, a greater contribution of plankton-derived lipids was observed in the sections corresponding to ca. 19601985 AD (6-4 cm) and ca. 100-200 AD (96-94 cm). Although different degradation rates for individual compounds might have partly affected biomarker assemblages, the variations could be attributed to a sharp decrease in the freshwater contribution to the Minho River estuary (dam construction) and a possible marine highstand, respectively. In addition, several parameters suggested changes in land use (including deforestation and farming) and probably the effects of mining exploitation during the Roman occupation of the area.

AB  - This study uses storm surge sediment beds deposited by Hurricanes Audrey (1957), Carla (1961), Rita (2005) and Ike (2008) to investigate spatial and temporal changes in marsh sedimentation on the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge in Southeastern Texas. Fourteen sediment cores were collected along a transect extending 1230 m inland from the Gulf coast. Storm-surge-deposited sediment beds were identified by texture, organic content, carbonate content, the presence of marine microfossils and Cs-137 dating. The hurricane-derived sediment beds facilitate assessment of changes in marsh sedimentation from nearshore to inland locations and over decadal to annual timescales. Spatial variation along the transect reflects varying contributions" from three prevailing sediment sources: flooding, overwash and organic sedimentation from marsh plants. Over about the last decade, hurricane overwash has been the predominant sediment source for nearshore locations because of large sediment inputs from Hurricanes Rita and Ike. Farther inland, hurricane inputs diminish and sedimentation is dominated by deposition from flood waters and a larger organic component. Temporal variations in sedimentation reflect hurricane activity, changes in marsh surface elevation and degree of compaction of marsh sediments, which is time-dependent. There was little to no marsh sedimentation in the period 2008-2014, firstly because no hurricanes impacted the study area and secondly because overwash sedimentation prior to 2008 had increased nearshore marsh surface elevations by up to 0.68 m, reducing subsequent inputs from flooding. Marsh sedimentation rates were relatively high in the period 2005-2008, averaging 2.13 cm/year and possibly reflecting sediment contributions from Hurricanes Humberto and Gustay. However, these marsh sediments are highly organic and largely uncompacted. Older, deeper marsh deposits formed between 1961 and 2005 are less organic rich, more compacted and have an average annual sedimentation rate of 0.38 cm/year, which is closely comparable to long-term sedimentation rates in similar marsh settings nearby. These results demonstrate the utility of using hurricane storm surge marker beds to investigate marsh sedimentation, provide insights into the sedimentary response of coastal marshes to hurricanes and provide useful guidance to public policy aimed at combating the effects of sea-level rise on coastal marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - The effect of a transition metal, cadmium (Cd), on reductive dechlorination of a model chlorinated organic, 2,3,4-trichloroaniline (2,3,4-TCA), was determined in the laboratory in three anaerobic, hooded soils with varying properties. Dechlorination of 2,3,4-TCA was inhibited over a continuum of pore-water-soluble Cd concentrations (10-200 mu g/L) in mineral-dominated rice paddy and bottomland hardwood soils. In organic-dominated marsh soil, however, a critical inhibitory level of pore-water-soluble Cd (200 mu g/L) was observed. Lower-chlorinated aniline metabolites differed with soluble Cd concentration. Different metabolites (2,3-dichloroaniline and 2-chloroaniline) were observed in some soils as Cd neared the completely inhibitory concentration. Speciation of soluble Cd was necessary to predict whether inhibition would occur, particularly in the presence of high concentrations of organic ligands such as humic acids. Selective extractions and measurement of acid-volatile sulfides provided additional information but did not adequately predict inhibition of dechlorination. These results demonstrate the importance of quantification and speciation of pore-water metal concentrations in predicting potential inhibition of anaerobic biodegradation reactions such as reductive dechlorination.

AB  - Clay minerals appear to change significantly under the influence of pasture development on poldered sediments in the Baie d'Authie area (Somme, France). Cores 40-90 cm deep from recent salt marsh sediments and poldered sediments developing grass pastures since 1737, 1575 and 1158 indicate that the natural mineral suite of kaolinite, mica, illite, and two disordered mixed-layered illite-smectite (I-S) phases common to the sedimentary input changes gradually but significantly in the materials. In the oldest, best-developed profile, there is a dominance of a disordered, illitic I-S in the humic upper part of the profile and a more abundant, more smectitic I-S mineral below. It appears that grass-derived humic materials tend to stabilize closed (collapsed) or illitic behavior in I-S clays. The natural evolution of the sediment (lower part of the profile) is towards a smectitic clay assemblage. Destruction of organic matter of the smectitic I-S minerals by oxidation indicates that this material can significantly modify the physical behavior of the clays keeping the structure open to polar molecules.

AB  - This paper reports the presence of a metastable mixture of Fe(II), O-2, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in sediment pore water in organic carbon-rich sediments in Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh systems. Field measurements at two different estuarine sites in South Carolina (one heavily urbanized and a protected research reserve) showed a broad region of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production more than 15 cm below the sediment surface within and immediately adjacent to the rhizospheres of S. alterniflora. Dissolved Fe(II) was positively correlated with hydrogen peroxide indicating a possible abiotic pathway to ROS production (r (2) = 0.94). The null hypothesis was tested that Fe(II) inventories were maintained by protective ligands and thus unreactive with respect to O-2 consumption and ROS production. The addition of an Fe-binding ligand, DTPA, resulted in rapid decline of ROS in pore water, indicating that Fe(II) was labile. The half-life of superoxide under the measured solution conditions was calculated and found to be less than a second. The combination of high lability and persistent ROS was interpreted to indicate a high rate of Fe(II) and O-2 supply to the pore water. The Ra-224/Th-228 disequilibrium was measured to determine the potential for advective mass transfer of dissolved oxygen via pore water exchange. The estimated pore water exchange of 54 L m(-2) day(-1) was significant but could not support the measured production of ROS alone, the direct exchange of O-2 from the S. alterniflora root system may have contributed significantly to ROS production in the sediments.

AB  - Aims N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon is recognized as an effective agent for regulating bacterial growth and metabolism. However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the associations of QS signal molecules with the dynamics and activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria in intertidal marshes.

AB  - Coastal systems worldwide deliver vital ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and coastal protection. Effectivity of these ecosystem services increases when vegetation is present. Understanding the mechanisms behind vegetation establishment in bio-geomorphic systems is necessary to understand their ability to recover after erosive events and potential adaptations to climate change. In this study, we examined how seed availability affects vegetation establishment in the salt marsh-intertidal flat transition zone: the area with capacity for lateral marsh expansion. This requires vegetation establishment; therefore, seed availability is essential. In a 6-month field experiment, we simulated a before and after winter seed dispersal at two locations, the salt-marsh vegetation edge and the intertidal flat, and studied seed retention, the seed bank, and the seed viability of three pioneer marsh species: Salicornia procumbens, Aster tripolium, and Spartina anglica. During winter storm conditions, all supplied seeds eroded away with the sediment surface layer. After winter, supplied seeds from all three species were retained, mostly at the surface while 9% was bioturbated downwards. In the natural seed bank, A. tripolium and S. anglica were practically absent while S. procumbens occurred more frequently. The viability of S. procumbens seeds was highest at the surface, between 80% and 90%. The viability quickly decreased with depth, although viable S. procumbens seeds occurred up to 15 cm depth. Only when seeds were supplied after winter, many S. procumbens and some S. anglica individuals did establish successfully in the transition zone. Viable seed availability formed a vegetation establishment threshold, even with a local seed source. Our results suggest that, although boundary conditions such as elevation, inundation, and weather conditions were appropriate for vegetation establishment in spring, the soil surface in winter can be so dynamic that it limits lateral marsh expansion. These insights can be used for designing effective nature-based coastal protection.

AB  - Mangrove forests and saltmarshes are important habitats for carbon (C) sequestration in the coastal zone but variation in rates of C sequestration and the factors controlling sequestration are poorly understood. We assessed C sequestration in Moreton Bay, South East Queensland in mangrove forests and tidal marshes that span a range of environmental settings and plant communities, including mangrove forests and tidal marshes on the oligotrophic sand islands of the eastern side of Moreton Bay and on the nutrient enriched, western side of the bay adjacent to the city of Brisbane. We found that rates of C sequestration in sediments were similar among mangrove forests over the bay, despite large differences in the C density of sediments, because of different rates of vertical accretion of sediments. The C sequestration on the oligotrophic sand island tidal marshes, dominated by Juncus kraussii, had the highest rate of C sequestration in the bay while the western saltmarshes, which were dominated by Sarcocornia quinqueflora, had the lowest rate of C sequestration. Our data indicate C sequestration varies among different tidal wetland plant community types, due to variation in sediment characteristics and rates of sediment accretion over time.

AB  - Tidal fluxes of total (TOC), dissolved (DOG) and suspended particulate (POC) organic carbon were measured between a high, Sarcocornia- Chenolea salt marsh and Kariega estuary, South Africa. Fluxes were measured over 42 tides, through four (7 to 14 d) sampling periods. The marsh showed an annual export of TOC of +16 gC m(-2) yr(-1), with 80% of this occurring in dissolved form. The export was equivalent to 6% of the aerial macrophyte production of the marsh. In both absolute terms, and relative to macrophyte production, the fluxes were similar to those reported for high elevation, Spartina patens and Distichlis spicata marshes on the east coast of the USA. They were, however, an order of magnitude smaller than for most tow, Spartina alterniflora marshes. A carbon budget developed for the Kariega marsh showed that respiration (mainly by the sediments and to a lesser extent by resident crabs) accounted for 70% of marsh production, leaving 30% for burial or export to the estuary. We speculate that the small export was a function of the high elevation of the marsh, and that the Outwelling Hypothesis may be less applicable to high than low marshes.

AB  - Ecosystem services such as protection from storms and erosion, tourism benefits, and climate adaptation and mitigation have been increasingly recognized as important considerations for environmental policymalcing. Recent research has shown that coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and mangroves provide climate mitigation services because they are particularly effective at sequestering and storing carbon dioxide, referred to as "coastal blue carbon". Unfortunately, degradation of blue carbon ecosystems due to anthropogenic impacts contributes to anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use impacts and prevents these ecosystems from continuing to sequester and store carbon. Given the impressive carbon sequestration and storage in coastal ecosystems, many countries with blue carbon resources are beginning to implement blue carbon restoration projects using carbon financing mechanisms. This study analyzed four case studies of projects in Kenya, India, Vietnam, and Madagascar, evaluating the individual carbon financing mechanisms, the project outcomes, and the policy implications of each. Strengths and challenges of implementing blue carbon projects are discussed and considerations that all projects should address are examined in order to develop long-term sustainable climate mitigation or adaptation policies. This analysis can help to inform future project design considerations as well as policy opportunities. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fiddler crab Uca rapax (Smith) feeds on microbes that colonize decaying cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel. in the salt marsh. Crab-burrowing activity brings organic matter to the sediment surface. This fosters microbial growth on the organic matter and stimulates cordgrass growth. Food supply to the crabs is thereby directly and indirectly enhanced. Fiddler crabs may dig more burrows than they require for their protective and physiological needs. There may be a selective advantage in digging burrows in excess of one burrow per crab, because of the benefit of enhancing food supply and decreasing the competition for food. Fiddler crabs may dig burrows "in excess- even when empty burrows are available and they may adjust their burrowing in response to food supply. This hypothesis was examined by (a) comparing burrow and crab density in a salt marsh, then (b) manipulating burrow density and (c) food availability in the laboratory. Furthermore, females were hypothesized to be more sensitive to food availability than males, and small crabs more sensitive than large crabs. Results showed that (a) there were more burrows than fiddler crabs, (b) smaller crabs of both sexes dug new burrows despite the presence of unoccupied burrows and (c) burrowing activity of smaller crabs of both sexes varied with food availability. When food availability was lower, they excavated as much sediment and dug more burrows and burrow branches, while allocating less time to burrowing. They did so by burrowing faster and to lesser depths. Small crabs may be more sensitive to food availability and may be better capable of adjusting their burrowing to food supply.

AB  - Salt marshes are sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide that respond to environmental changes related to sea level rise and climate. Here we assess how climatic variations affect marsh-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide in the short term and compare it to long-term burial rates based on radiometric dating. The 5years of atmospheric measurements show a strong interannual variation in atmospheric carbon exchange, varying from -104 to -233gCm(-2)a(-1) with a mean of -17932gCm(-2)a(-1). Variation in these annual sums was best explained by differences in rainfall early in the growing season. In the two years with below average rainfall in June, both net uptake and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were less than in the other three years. Measurements in 2016 and 2017 suggest that the mechanism behind this variability may be rainfall decreasing soil salinity which has been shown to strongly control productivity. The net ecosystem carbon balance was determined as burial rate from four sediment cores using radiometric dating and was lower than the net uptake measured by eddy covariance (mean: 11013gCm(-2)a(-1)). The difference between these estimates was significant and may be because the atmospheric measurements do not capture lateral carbon fluxes due to tidal exchange. Overall, it was smaller than values reported in the literature for lateral fluxes and highlights the importance of investigating lateral C fluxes in future studies.

AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems characterized by foundation species, such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and mangrove forests, are rich in biodiversity and support a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, food provisioning, water filtration, carbon sequestration, recreational opportunities, cultural value, among others. These ecosystems have experienced degradation and a net loss of total area in regions around the world due to a host of anthropogenic stressors, resulting in declines in the associated ecosystem services they provide. Because of the extensive degradation in many locations, increasing attention has turned to ecosystem restoration of these marine habitats. Restoration techniques for marine and coastal ecosystems are generally more expensive when compared to terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting locations that will provide the largest return on investment, not only for the probability and magnitude of restoration success, but also for ecosystem service outcomes. However, site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration receive relatively lithe attention in the scientific literature, suggesting a need to better study how spatial planning tools could be incorporated into restoration practice. To the degree that site selection has been formally evaluated in the literature, the criteria have tended to focus more on environmental conditions beneficial for the restored habitat, and less on ecosystem service outcomes once the habitat is restored, which may vary considerably from site to site, or with more complex landscape dynamics and spatial patterns of connectivity. Here we (1) review recent (2015-2019) scientific peer-reviewed literature for several marine ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests) to investigate how commonly site selection or spatial planning principles are applied or investigated in scholarly research about marine ecosystem restoration at different spatial scales, (2) provide a conceptual overview of the rationale for applying spatial planning principles to marine ecosystem restoration, and (3) highlight promising analytical approaches from the marine spatial planning and conservation planning literatures that could help improve restoration outcomes. We argue that strategic site selection and spatial planning for marine ecosystem restoration, particularly applied at larger spatial scales and accounting for ecosystem service outcomes, can help support more effective restoration.

AB  - A long-term data base (2000-2009) was used to evaluate tidal floodwater salinity and the resulting soil biogeochemical setting (methanogenic or sulfate reducing) at 54 substations, which included a variety of marsh and swamp community types along the freshwater/saltwater boundary of the Cape Fear River/Estuary, North Carolina. During this decade, a variety of extreme climatic events, i.e. floods and droughts, occurred, but overall data reflected long-term, natural conditions. At sites flooded by > 1 ppt saline water more than 25 % of the time, wetlands consisted of varying types of tidal marsh. Temperate, tidal swamps were present at sites flooded by this level of saline water less than 12 % of high tides. Flooding > 25 % of tides by > 1 ppt seawater converted soils in those wetlands from methanogenic into sulfate reducing conditions > 50 % of the time. The point along an estuarine gradient where adjacent wetlands are flooded by > 1 ppt saline water less than 25 %, but more than 12 % is the zone of transition. The conversion of a tidal swamp to tidal marsh is not only caused by salt water itself, but by the sulfate constituent in seawater. Once a sufficient concentration of sulfate enters soils, sulfate reducing bacteria become active reducing the sulfate into hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to any wetland plant species not adapted to this toxic substance. The incidence of flooding by high tides containing > 1 ppt salinity is an accurate predictor of functional change in adjacent wetlands. Wetlands receiving intermediate levels of saline water, i.e. 12-25 % flooding with 1 ppt floodwater, were in some state of transition from swamp to marsh. Once trees in tidal swamps are killed, the wetland moves inevitably towards a tidal marsh dominated by species of herbaceous vascular plants with varying tolerance to saline water.

AB  - To promote the sequestration of blue carbon, resource managers rely on best-management practices that have historically included protecting and restoring vegetated coastal habitats (seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves), but are now beginning to incorporate catchment-level approaches. Drawing upon knowledge from a broad range of environmental variables that influence blue carbon sequestration, including warming, carbon dioxide levels, water depth, nutrients, runoff, bioturbation, physical disturbances, and tidal exchange, we discuss three potential management strategies that hold promise for optimizing coastal blue carbon sequestration: (1) reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs, (2) reinstating top-down control of bioturbator populations, and (3) restoring hydrology. By means of case studies, we explore how these three strategies can -minimize blue carbon losses and maximize gains. A key research priority is to more accurately quantify the impacts of these strategies on atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions in different settings at landscape scales.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora, a species vegetating on inter-tidal flats that was introduced from the eastern coast of United States, has become a hot topic, focusing on its invasion within local species in the coastal zone of China. Impacts of S. alterniflora on the inter-tidal macrobenthos community in the Jiangsu coastland are addressed by comparing the macrobenthos characteristics in a mudflat and in a four-year-old Spartina salt marsh that had earlier been a mudflat. During the period October 2002-July 2003, we studied the distribution pattern and diversity of macrobenthos, and discussed their correlation with environmental factors caused by Spartina vegetation. The results showed that a total of 43 macrobenthos species were found, mainly consisting of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Annelida. Ten macrobenthos species were found in the Spartina salt marsh, and 36 species were found in the mudflat. Life forms and functional groups of macrobenthos in the Spartina salt marsh were obviously distrinct from that of the mudflat. The study showed that macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh decreased, and the community structure altered obviously, whereas the biomass showed no differences in different seasons. Statistical analysis demonstrated that seasonal change of macrobenthos diversity in the Spartina salt marsh negatively related to content of sediment organic matter, total N, bulk density, height and biomass of Spartina vegetation, and positively related to the density of Spartina. All these differences suggested the obvious effects of the Spartina vegetation on the Jiangsu inter-tidal benthic macroinvertebrate ecology. Furthermore, the investigation also showed that the niche of the native macrobenthos living in the mudflat has been transferred down, seaward, due to the invasion of Spartina in our study site.

AB  - Salt marshes can build in elevation with sea-level rise through accumulation of inorganic sediment and organic matter, but marshes worldwide are under threat of drowning due to rapid rates of sea-level rise that outpace natural marsh building rates. The application of a thin layer of sediment to the marsh surface (thin-layer placement ETLII) is a tool to build elevation and decrease flooding stress, but its effects on marsh plants are understudied, especially in New England. In a novel application of a marsh organ experiment (i.e. rows of pots at different elevations), the addition of 10 cm of sand to pots planted with Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens resulted in fewer stems than controls for S. patens but not S. alterniflora after 2 months. However, total biomass and root mass were not significantly impacted for either species, suggesting plants will fully recover from TLP over longer timescales. Effects of TLP on biomass and stem density did not vary significantly by elevation. Although long-term research is still needed, short-term equivalency in biomass between TLP treatments and controls suggests TLP of 10 cm is a promising strategy to enhance the ability of marshes to build vertically as sea level rises in New England.

AB  - Bald mud beaches were found among the mangrove marshes in Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. To investigate the possible reasons for this phenomenon, the intertidal zones of a mangrove transect and a bald beach transect with similar topography and tidal actions were selected for comparison study. Along both transects, observed water table variations were significant in the high and low intertidal zones and negligible in the middle intertidal zones. Despite the same tidal actions and above-mentioned similarities, observed groundwater salinity was significantly smaller along the mangrove transect (average 23.0 ppt) than along the bald beach transect (average 28.5 ppt). These observations invite one hypothesis: the hydraulic structure of tidal marsh and freshwater availability may be the main hydrogeological factors critical to mangrove development. Two-dimensional numerical simulations corroborated the speculation and gave results in line with the observed water table. The two transects investigated were found to have a mud-sand two-layered structure: a surface zone of low-permeability mud and an underlying high-permeability zone that outcrops at the high and low tide lines. The freshwater recharge from inland is considerable along the mangrove transect but negligible along the bald beach transect. The high-permeability zone may provide opportunity for the plants in the mangrove marsh to uptake freshwater and oxygen through their roots extending downward into the high-permeability zone, which may help limit the buildup of salt in the root zone caused by evapotranspiration and enhance salt removal, which may further increase the production of marsh grasses and influence their spatial distribution. The bald beach is most probably due to the lack of enough freshwater for generating a brackish beach soil condition essential to mangrove growth. It is also indicated that seawater infiltrated the high-permeability zone through its outcrop near the high intertidal zone, and discharged from the tidal river bank in the vicinity of the low tide line. These processes thereby formed a tide-induced seawater-groundwater circulation, which likely provided considerable contribution to the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Finally, implications and uncertainties behind this study were summarized for future examinations.

AB  - Soil salinization occurs naturally in coastal areas owing to seawater intrusion and upward salt accumulation. High soil salinity limits most plants and the plant community in coastal salt marsh is mainly composed of salt-tolerant plants. The resilience of ecosystem is largely determined by the standing vegetation. However, little is known about how pioneer vegetation impacts on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, especially associated with salinization. Thus, field investigations were conducted to evaluate the difference of soil indicators in vegetation patches with that in bare lands during an intense soil salinization period in Bohai Sea coastal wasteland, North China. Root distribution for vegetation patches and soil physicochemical properties for vegetation patches and bare lands were examined in 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depth layers. The results showed that regardless of the plant species, roots in vegetation patches were mainly distributed in 0-20 cm depth and greatly promoted the soil spatial heterogeneity. Particularly, soils beneath vegetation patches exhibited higher soil total carbon content, total porosity, macro-porosity, large aggregates percentage, mean weight diameter, and saturated water content; lower bulk density, capillary porosity, soil water storage capacity, and soil electrical conductivity than that for bare lands in 0-20 cm depth. The correlation analysis among topsoil (0-20 cm) indicated that the formation of soil large aggregates and pore structure was negatively related to soil electrical conductivity. In conclusion, vegetation patches promoted the formation of soil large aggregates and macro-porosity in topsoil by root distribution. Moreover, the plant-mediated soil structure improvement enhanced the soil resistance to salt accumulation and further promoted the topsoil desalinization. The findings of this study provide some insights into the regulation of pioneer vegetation on soil environment in coastal ecosystem, supporting ecological succession and plant-mediated ecological restoration in saline lands.

AB  - Due to reductions in freeze events, mangroves have been rapidly encroaching into previously salt marshdominated coastal wetlands along the northeastern shores of Florida, USA. This shift in dominant wetland vegetation type may have significant implications for belowground processes such as soil organic matter decomposition and respiration. Using a full factorial greenhouse mesocosm experiment, we investigated the effects of plant type (no plant, Avicennia germinans, or Spartina alterniflora) and soil type (sand, mangrove-derived soil, or marsh-derived soil) on estimated heterotrophic soil respiration rates. While we predicted that A. germinans mangrove seedlings would increase heterotrophic respiration, we found that mangrove seedlings did not increase heterotrophic respiration when compared to control (no plant) treatments. Additionally, we found that heterotrophic respiration was higher in marsh-derived soils than in mangrove-derived soils for both control and mangrove plant treatments. Our findings suggest that the stage of mangrove invasion and the level of root development may influence changes in heterotrophic soil respiration.

AB  - Pore and surface water sulfide variation near artificial ditches and a natural creek are examined in salt marshes bordering the Indian River Lagoon in east-central Florida. Pore water sulfide concentrations ranged from 0-mu-g-at l-1 to 1,640-mu-g-at l-1. On average, the natural creek had the lowest sulfide concentrations (mean < 1.0-mu-g-at l-1) and the perimeter ditch of a managed salt marsh impoundment the highest (436.5-mu-g-at l-1). There was a trend of increasing sulfide concentration in the summer, and sharp peaks in late fall-early winter which correspond with peak litter input into the sediments. Significant differences in sulfide concentration between sites are attributed to differences in water flow and in organic matter content. Delaying the seasonal opening of culverts (which connect impounded marshes with the lagoon) until lagoon water levels rise in fall may prevent massive fish kills that have been associated with high sulfide levels in the impoundment perimeter ditches.

AB  - The freshwater marshes in northern China are heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbances such as cultivation and fertilization and increased levels of nutrients (especially N and P) through atmospheric deposition and agricultural surface runoff. These disturbances have affected the emission of N2O from these systems. This laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of increased inputs of inorganic N and P on N2O emission from marsh soil in response to different soil moisture conditions. The results showed that the emission of N2O increased with the enhancement of N inputs when the soil was submerged, but that the highest N treatment suppressed the emission of N2O when the soil was at 60% water holding capacity (WHC), which may have occurred due to an inadequate amount of available C. Furthermore, the results of this study indicated that a small amount of N fertilizer induced much more N2O evolution from freshwater wetland soil, while P fertilizer inputs appeared to stimulate the emission of N2O only during the first few days of the experiment. Additionally, soil that was treated with P appeared to absorb N2O when it was at 60% WHC after around 6 weeks of the incubation, which indicates that the input of P fertilizer might serve as a shift of source or N2O sink in wetland soils under non-flooded conditions. When compared to soil at 60% WHC, submerged soil had significantly higher N2O emissions, except when subjected to the medial N treatment. These findings indicate that the soil moisture condition had a significant effect on N2O emissions when the same amount of N or P was applied. Therefore, the effects of N and P fertilization in the northern temperate wetlands cannot be neglected from regional or national emissions of N2O.

AB  - Smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has rapidly spread in salt marshes of Yangtze River estuary. However, there is no consistent pattern on the effects of S. alterniflora invasions on microhabitats and benthic communities. The study first compared vegetation, water velocity, sediment deposition rate, sediment properties and benthic communities between invasive S. alterniflora and native Scirpus mariqueter patches using a pair-wise sampling design at 3 sites (Dongtan, Jiuduansha and Nanhui) in four seasons. The stands of S. alterniflora exhibited taller and less dense shoots, greater aboveground biomass and longer phenological phase than did S. mariqueter. S. alterniflora marshes had significantly lower water velocity, greater sediment deposition rates and higher light attenuation relative to S. mariqueter habitats. In general, sediment temperature, salinity, porosity, organic carbon content and microalgal biomass (Chla) did not significantly differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats at any of 3 sites. Thirty-four of 37 macrofauna species recorded did not exhibit density differences between habitat types. Limited influences on macrofauna were evident only at Dongtan where S. alterniflora marshes had significantly greater gastropod densities in the autumn. In 8 of 12 observations, benthic community structure did not differ between invaded and uninvaded habitats. It was concluded that the differences in physical structure were not enough to significantly change sediment properties, macrofaunal density and community structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chemical (via buffered ascorbate-citrate) and microbial (via Shewanella decolorationis S12) iron reduction kinetics in the surficial tidal marsh sediments of the Min River Estuary were compared at six locations along the inundation gradient. A reactive continuum model was successfully applied to describe the kinetic results. Along the inundation gradient, an enhanced tidal inundation frequency towards the sea resulted in changes in the pH, Eh, salinity, as well as the abundances and fractions of reactive Fe(II) and Fe(III). Significant differences were observed between the chemical and microbial iron reductions among the six locations. Larger reducible Fe(III) pools, higher initial rates, and lower mineral heterogeneity were observed in chemical assays when compared to microbial assays. The microbial and chemical reducible Fe(III) as well as their initial reduction rates generally decreased along the inundation gradient. The chemical mineral heterogeneity gradually increased along the inundation gradient, while the microbial mineral heterogeneities were not significantly different at the six locations. Consequently, a higher iron reduction potential was observed in the uplands when compared to that in the lowlands. The result highlights the role of tidal hydrology and topography in iron reduction and suggest that both the pool and mineral heterogeneities of highly reactive Fe(III) should be considered in iron biogeochemical investigations.

AB  - Much uncertainty exists in spatial and temporal variations of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from coastal marshes in temperate regions. To investigate the spatial and temporal variations of N2O fluxes and determine the environmental factors influencing N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary, China, in situ measurements were conducted in high marsh (HM), middle marsh (MM), low marsh (LM), and mudflat (MF) in autumn and winter during 2011-2012. Results showed that mean N2O fluxes and cumulative N2O emission indicated intertidal zone of the examined marshes as N2O sources over all sampling seasons with range of 0.0051 to 0.0152 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1) and 7.58 to 22.02 mg N2O m(-2), respectively. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O fluxes from the intertidal zone ranged from -0.0004 to 0.0644 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1). The freeze/thaw cycles in sediments during early winter (frequent short-term cycle) and midwinter (long-term cycle) were one of main factors affecting the temporal variations of N2O emission. The spatial variations of N2O fluxes in autumn were mainly dependent on tidal fluctuation and plant composition. The ammonia-nitrogen (NH4 (+)-N) in sediments of MF significantly affected N2O emissions (p < 0.05), and the high concentrations of Fe in sediments might affect the spatial variation of N2O fluxes. This study highlighted the large spatial variation of N2O fluxes across the coastal marsh (coefficient of variation (CV) = 127.86 %) and the temporal variation of N2O fluxes during 2011-2012 (CV = 137.29 %). Presently, the exogenous C and N loadings of the Yellow River estuary are increasing due to human activities; thus, the potential effects of exogenous C and N loadings on N2O emissions during early winter should be paid more attention as the N2O inventory is assessed precisely.

AB  - The relationships between soil factors and plant species were investigated in salt marshes on the west coast of central Italy along a dune-cultivated land gradient with similar topographic elevations. Plant community composition was quantified in three zones (marsh-dune border, central marsh, and marsh-cultivated land border) identified across the gradient. The results suggest that the distribution and variation in abundance "performance" of plant species is mainly ruled by salinity and soil texture gradients (from sandy to silt-clay). Texture seemed to affect vegetation zonation in the marshes near sand dunes, since at the marsh-dune border the percentage of wind-blown sand increases. Variations in field capacity, total organic carbon, pH, and calcium carbonate did not appear to control the performance of plant species. Indications on the performance of six species are provided. Limbarda crithmoides increased with the amount of sand and was often located at the marsh-dune border. Elymus repens and Phragmites australis increased with decreasing salinity and were frequently found at marsh borders, however E. repens also increased with the amount of silt-clay. Sarcocornia fruticosa increased with salinity and silt-clay, while Halimione portulacoides increased with salinity and seemed less subject to changes in soil texture. Elymus pycnanthus increased with salinity and decreased with the amount of silt-clay, however, the ordination suggested that other factors may be determinant for this species. These species could be useful to map saline environments and to reconstruct an appropriate scenario in restoration projects of Mediterranean salt marshes.

AB  - Tidal wetlands provide myriad ecosystem services across local to global scales. With their uncertain vulnerability or resilience to rising sea levels, there is a need for mapping flooding drivers and vulnerability proxies for these ecosystems at a national scale. However, tidal wetlands in the conterminous USA are diverse with differing elevation gradients, and tidal amplitudes, making broad geographic comparisons difficult. To address this, a national-scale map of relative tidal elevation (Z*(MHW)), a physical metric that normalizes elevation to tidal amplitude at mean high water (MHW), was constructed for the first time at 30 x 30-m resolution spanning the conterminous USA. Contrary to two study hypotheses, watershed-level median Z*(MHW) and its variability generally increased from north to south as a function of tidal amplitude and relative sea-level rise. These trends were also observed in a reanalysis of ground elevation data from the Pacific Coast by Janousek et al. (Estuaries and Coasts 42 (1): 85-98, 2019). Supporting a third hypothesis, propagated uncertainty in Z*(MHW) increased from north to south as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) errors had an outsized effect under narrowing tidal amplitudes. The drivers of Z*(MHW) and its variability are difficult to determine because several potential causal variables are correlated with latitude, but future studies could investigate highest astronomical tide and diurnal high tide inequality as drivers of median Z*(MHW) and Z*(MHW) variability, respectively. Watersheds of the Gulf Coast often had propagated Z*(MHW) uncertainty greater than the tidal amplitude itself emphasizing the diminished practicality of applying Z*(MHW) as a flooding proxy to microtidal wetlands. Future studies could focus on validating and improving these physical map products and using them for synoptic modeling of tidal wetland carbon dynamics and sea-level rise vulnerability analyses.

AB  - This study examined impacts of Macondo MC252 oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill on oil-degrading bacteria in fresh and oligohaline marshes dominated by the common reed Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and correlated microbial changes to soil variables. We hypothesized that indigenous oil-degrading bacteria and soil characteristics in the marshes effectively respond to Macondo oil. We tested this hypothesis with a greenhouse mesocosm study. Weathered and emulsified Macondo oil was applied to P. australis sods at different rates (0, 4, 8, 12, and 16Lm(-2)). Populations of oil degrading bacteria containing alkane monooxygenase and PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase alpha subunit (PAH-RHD) genes, the expression of these genes, soil respiration rate, residual total petroleum hydrocarbon, redox potential (Eh), as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its aromaticity index of SUVA(254) were measured in soils 2months after oil addition. Oil exposure generally increased oil-degrading bacterial populations, in particular Gram-positive (GP) PAH-degraders, soil respiration rate, DOC concentration, and aromaticity of DOC, but decreased Eh values. GP PAH-RHD genes accounted for approximately 98% of total detected genes, and expression of these genes increased by a factor of 3 to 5 at various oil dosages. Both abundance and expression of GP PAH-RHD genes significantly correlated to SUVA(254) (P<0.05). The study revealed that indigenous oil-degrading bacteria effectively responded to weathered Macondo oil in the P. australis marsh soil wherein GP bacteria with PAH-RHD genes played a major role in biodegradation of PAH-enriched petroleum hydrocarbons.

AB  - Frequent environmental changes and abiotic gradients of the Wadden Sea require appropriate adaptations of the local organisms and make it suitable for investigations on functional structure of macrozoobenthic communities from marine to terrestrial boundaries. To investigate community patterns and food use of the macrozoobenthos,a transect of 11 stations was sampled for species number, abundance and stable isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of macrozoobenthos and for stable isotope values of potential food resources. The transect was located in the back-barrier system of the island of Spiekeroog (southern North Sea, Germany). Our results show that surface and subsurface deposit feeders, such as Peringia ulvae and different oligochaete species, dominated the community, which was poor in species, while species present at the transect stations reached high abundance. The only exception was the upper salt marsh with low abundances but higher species richness because of the presence of specialized semi-terrestrial and terrestrial taxa. The macrozoobenthos relied predominantly on marine resources irrespective of the locality in the intertidal zone, although delta C-13 an values of the consumers decreased from -14.1 +/- 1.6% (tidal flats) to -21.5 +/- 2.4% (salt marsh). However, the ubiquitous polychaete Hediste diversicolor showed a delta N-15 enrichment of 2.8%(an increase of about one trophic level) from bare sediments to the first vegetated transect station, presumably due to switching from suspension or deposit feeding to predation on smaller invertebrates. Hence, we conclude that changes in feeding mode represent an important mechanism of adaptation to different Wadden Sea habitats.

AB  - Sediment transport in the salt marsh and the lagoon of Penouille is driven by tidal currents, waves, wind, and ice rafting, which interact with topography and vegetation to control the spatial distribution of surface sediments. Multiple linear regressions of 203 samples of marsh surface sediments show that grain size gets finer and organic matter content increases with distance from the lagoon inlet, the sandy peninsula, the closest creek, and the lagoon. The vegetation parameters and surface microtopography have only a minor influence. Locally, grain size can get finer with elevation, while organic matter content increases. However, across the entire marsh, grain size exhibits the opposite trend with elevation, a consequence of aeolian transport and ice rafting. The 94 samples covering the lagoon show a trend of finer grain size with distance from the lagoon inlet and with sea grass cover. Penouille marsh has been relatively stable from 1975 to 2008: analysis of five georeferenced aerial photographs shows that only 3% of the marsh area was lost due to outer marsh edge retreat. Ten sediment cores collected in the marsh show a thickness of 0.14-0.72 m of marsh sediments overlying a sandy substrate. Radiocarbon dates suggest that marsh establishment occurred in the north side of the lagoon around 1000-1200 cal BP. Accretion rates based on radiocarbon dates are 0.4-1 mm/y for several centuries, whereas Cs-137 dating indicates rates of 1-3 mm/y since 1963, and accretion plates indicate 2.9 0.9 mm/y between 2010 and 2012. Accretion rates since 1963 are similar to the relative sea-level rise (RSLR) of 1.5 mm/y at Penouille for the 1969-2014 period. However, the accelerated RSLR of 3.7 mm/y observed over the last 20 years and additional RSLR due to climate change may progressively drown the marsh if accretion rate does not substantially increase.

AB  - The US South Atlantic Bight (SAB) is a low-latitude shallow continental shelf bordered landward by abundant salt marshes and rivers. Based on previously published data on sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and new dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) data, a model analysis is presented to identify and quantify the contributions of various terrestrial carbon inputs on SAB sea surface pCO(2). After removal of pCO(2) variations due to annual temperature variability and air-sea gas exchange from the in situ pCO(2), the temperature-and gas-exchange-corrected pCO(2) (TG-corrected pCO(2)) is derived. Contributions from rivers, salt marshes, and the continental shelf to the TG-corrected pCO(2) are then calculated. Our findings demonstrate that although additions of CO2 from within shelf waters (i.e., 1 pCO(2)(shelf)) were the greatest of the three components and underwent the largest seasonal changes, 1 pCO(2)(shelf) showed smaller onshore-offshore gradients than rivers and marshes. In contrast, CO2 contributions from river (1 pCO(2)(river)) and salt marsh (1 pCO(2)(marsh)) components were greatest closest to the coast and decreased with distance offshore. In addition, the magnitude of 1 pCO(2)(marsh) was about three-fold greater than 1 pCO(2)(river). Our findings also revealed that decomposition of terrestrial organic carbon was an important factor regulating the seasonal pattern of pCO(2) on the inner shelf. Despite large uncertainties, this study demonstrates the importance of terrestrial inputs, in particular those from coastal wetlands, on coastal ocean CO2 distributions.

AB  - Wetlands have an inordinate influence on the global greenhouse gas budget, but how global changes may alter wetland contribution to future greenhouse gas fluxes is poorly understood. We determined the greenhouse gas balance of a tidal marsh exposed to nine years of experimental carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) manipulation. We estimated net carbon (C) gain rates by measuring changes in plant and soil C pools over nine years. In wetland soils that accrete primarily through organic matter inputs, long-term measurements of soil elevation, along with soil C density, provide a robust estimate of net soil C gain. We used net soil C gain along with methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to determine the radiative forcing of the marsh under elevated CO2 and N addition. Nearly all plots exhibited a net gain of C over the study period (up to 203 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and C gain rates were greater with N and CO2 addition. Treatment effects on C gain and methane emissions dominated trends in radiative forcing while nitrous oxide fluxes in all treatments were negligible. Though these soils experience salinities that typically suppress methane emissions, our results suggest that elevated CO2 can stimulate methane emissions, overcoming positive effects of elevated CO2 on C gain, converting brackish marshes that are typically net greenhouse gas sinks into sources. Adding resources, either CO2 or N, will likely increase "blue carbon'' accumulation rates in tidal marshes, but importantly, each resource can have distinct influences on the direction of total greenhouse forcing.

AB  - Burial of aboveground plant litter by animals reduces the amount available for surface transport and places it into a different environment, affecting decomposition rates and fluxes of organic matter to adjacent ecosystems. Here we show that in a Southwestern Atlantic salt marsh the burrowing crab Neohelice granulata buries aboveground plant litter at rates (0.5-8 g m(-2) day(-1)) comparable to those of litter production (3 g m(-2) day(-1)). Buried litter has a low probability (0.6%) of returning to the marsh surface. The formation of burrow excavation mounds on the marsh surface is responsible for most litter burial, whereas litter trapped in burrows was an order of magnitude lower than rates of burial under excavation mounds. Crab exclusion markedly increased surface litter accumulation (3.5-fold in just 21 days). Tides with the potential to transport significant amounts of surface litter are infrequent; hence, most litter is buried before it can be transported elsewhere or decomposes on the surface. Crab litter burial can account for the observed low levels of surface litter accumulation in this ecosystem and likely drives organic matter transformation and export. The impacts of ecosystem engineering by this crab species are therefore substantial and comparable in magnitude to the large effects found for tropical crabs and other litter-burying organisms, such as anecic earthworms.

AB  - Assumptions of a static landscape inspire predictions that about half of the world's coastal wetlands will submerge during this century in response to sea-level acceleration. In contrast, we use simulations from five numerical models to quantify the conditions under which ecogeomorphic feedbacks allow coastal wetlands to adapt to projected changes in sea level. In contrast to previous sea-level assessments, we find that non-linear feedbacks among inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition, allow marshes to survive conservative projections of sea-level rise where suspended sediment concentrations are greater than similar to 20 mg/L. Under scenarios of more rapid sea-level rise (e. g., those that include ice sheet melting), marshes will likely submerge near the end of the 21st century. Our results emphasize that in areas of rapid geomorphic change, predicting the response of ecosystems to climate change requires consideration of the ability of biological processes tomodify their physical environment.

AB  - The spatial and temporal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in a coastal reclamation area in eastern China were studied based on the ordinary kriging method. The 0-20 cm soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) and soil total nitrogen pool (STNP) ranged from 4.38 to 15.92 Mg/ha and from 0.24 to 2.37 Mg/ha, respectively, during the observed period. The results show there was a low level of spatial variation in both SOC and STN, which is to some extent the result of the same farmland management practiced in this region. The seasonal variation of SOC was attributed to plant growth and crop residue returning back to soil, while the spatial variation was mainly resulted from the fertilization practice. The average 0-20 cm SOCP and STNP were 10.38 +/- A 2.50 and 1.27 +/- A 0.38 Mg/ha, respectively, in the study region, both of which were much lower than in other ecosystems. Further analysis indicated that SOC was positively correlated with STN. This work revealed that the reclamation area from the tidal flat should be a potential sink for SOC and STN.

AB  - The present investigation quantifies the biodiversity of the Brachyura and fish living within the natural mangrove Avicennia marina, salt marsh and replanted mangal, and compares relevant features of the abiotic and biotic environments of these habitats. Measurements of sediment organic matter, grain size, soil water pH and the moisture content indicate that the natural mangrove areas have lowest mean grain size, pH, and highest organic and moisture contents. Planted mangrove areas have a higher mean grain size and slightly higher pH, but lower organic and moisture contents. Differences occur between brachyurans in planted and natural mangrove areas, but the biodiversity was similar between salt marsh and natural mangrove areas. Nasima dotilliformis was the only crab which did not occur at all planted mangrove sites, while Serenella leachii was missing from natural mangrove. Juvenile fish species enter mangroves, using these as nursery grounds, and quantitative sampling indicates that mangrove areas, especially pneumatophores, form a special habitat for these small fish.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are critically important ecosystems that provide ecosystem services including carbon sequestration, storm surge mitigation, water filtration, and wildlife habitat provision while supporting high levels of biodiversity. Despite their importance, monitoring these systems over large scales remains challenging due to difficulties in obtaining extensive up-to-date ground surveys and the need for high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery for effective space-borne monitoring. In this study, we developed methodologies to advance the monitoring of tidal marshes and adjacent deepwaters in the Mid-Atlantic and Gulf Coast United States. We combined Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 optical imagery to classify marshes and open water in both regions, with user's and producer's accuracies exceeding 89%. This methodology enables the assessment of marsh loss through conversion to open water at an annual resolution. We used time-series Sentinel-1 imagery to classify persistent and non-persistent marsh vegetation with greater than 93% accuracy. Non-persistent marsh vegetation serves as an indicator of salinity regimes in tidal wetlands. Additionally, we mapped two invasive species: wetlands invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) with greater than 80% accuracy and deepwater invasive Trapa natans (water chestnut) with greater than 96% accuracy. These results have important implications for improved monitoring and management of coastal wetlands ecosystems.

AB  - A reasonable predicting model for spatial variation of soil carbon would be a useful tool in monitoring and restoration of salt marshes. In this study, radial basis function neural networks model (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks model (BPNN) were built to predict total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. Both models contained thirteen input parameters, i.e., nine topographic factors selected from ASTER GDEM Version2 and Geographical Information System (GIS), one vegetation index - MODIS 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and three soil physicochemical properties. For prediction of TC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 61.87%, 81.36% and 56.82%; for TOC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 37.13%, 58.06% and 35.23%; both models had no significant difference in accuracy for DOC prediction, but the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller. All ME values of RBFNN rather than BPNN were closer to zero. RBFNN integrating environmental factors had a higher accuracy than BPNN in predicting soil carbon content at a relatively small regional scale.

AB  - Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating techniques are used to characterize recent peat accumulation rates of alpine peatlands located in Zoige, Tibetan plateau. Several cores were collected in different parts of the peatlands. Cores were Pb-210- and Cs-137-dated, and these data were used to calculate sediment accumulation rates. Ranges of dry mass accumulation rates were 0.021 similar to 0.048 g cm(-2) yr(-1) (the mean value is 0.033 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). The mean sediment fluxes of SOC, LC and TN in the marsh soil were 113 g m(-2) yr(-1), 12 g m(-2) yr(-1) and 5 g m(-2) yr(-1) seperatly during 1952 similar to 2004 using Cs-137 and Pb-210 techenique. The changes of SOC, TN and LC accumulation flux were similar with that of the temperature of May. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to plant invasion and expected sea level rise in China. This study explored the responses of microbial communities and extracellular enzyme activity in the marsh soils of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora to waterlogging and increasing salinity (to mimic prolonged inundation and saltwater intrusion) based on the determination of phospholipid fatty acids and analysis of enzyme kinetics. The results showed that waterlogging and increased salinity treatments decreased the soil microbial biomass in both P. australis and S. alterniflora soils, with waterlogging exacerbating the negative effects of salinity. Fungi/bacteria ratios decreased under both waterlogging and salinity treatments, whereas actinomycetes/bacteria ratios increased with increasing salinity. The degree of the adverse effects of salinity on plant growth of S. alterniflora and soil microbial biomass was lower than that on P. australis. Generally, waterlogging treatment increased the activity of sucrase, cellulase, urease, and dehydrogenase in S. alterniflora soil. Increased salinity decreased all the assayed extracellular enzyme activity in both P. australis and S. alterniflora soils. The synergistic effects of waterlogging and increased salinity treatments on the enzyme activities in P. australis soil were significant, whereas only the effect on the cellulase activity was significant in S. alterniflora soil. This study indicated a greater ability of the microbial community and extracellular enzyme activity of S. alterniflora soil to adapt to waterlogging and increased salinity compared with those of P. australis soil due to the lower sensitivity of S. alterniflora growth and soil nutrients to stress.

AB  - Enchytraeidae) were recorded in three floodplain meadows differing in soil type in Northern Germany during 2 years of contrasting hydrological extremes: 2002 with high precipitation, extended winter inundations and summer floods in two of the sites, and 2003 with an extraordinarily dry summer. In all sites, earthworms dominated the biomass of soil fauna, the dominant species being Octolasion tyrtaeum in marsh soil, Octolasion cyaneum in peat soil, Allolobophora chlorotica in gley soil, and Lumbricus rubellus in all three sites. The enchytraeid communities composed of 7-10 species, differed widely between sites.
   While the summer flood of 2002 reduced annelid populations in peat soil to zero, in gley soil only enchytraeids were sharply reduced. The earthworms there probably were less affected because of shorter duration of the flood, the lower air temperatures and SOM contents and the diapause of the dominant A. chlorotica. During summer drought in 2003, earthworms and enchytraeids were absent from gley soil, while they had maximum abundances in peat soil. The marsh soil, structured by a microrelief of shallow ditches and ridges, had highest densities of annelids. As it was not subjected to summer flooding in 2002, populations of both earthworms and potworms were stable. The drought in 2003 led to a sharp decrease in earthworm abundance in July, while the enchytraeids reached maximum values. Dynamics and survival strategies of different annelid species are discussed.
   The water holding capacity as well as the organic matter content of the soil are important factors for annelids in sites subjected to such hydrological extremes.
   To promote terrestrial annelids, controlled flooding should be kept short, especially in winters following natural summer floods. If possible, recovery times for annelids should be guarenteed, that is 2-3 months without inundations for enchytraeids and about half a year for earthworms. A microrelief with drier refuge sites can be judged as favourable for earthworms. An artificially raised groundwater table will favour annelids during drought periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In many wetland plants, belowground transport of O-2 via aerenchyma tissue and subsequent O-2 loss across root surfaces generates small oxic root zones at depth in the rhizosphere with important consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling. This study demonstrates how roots of the intertidal salt-marsh plant Spartina anglica affect not only O-2, but also pH and CO2 dynamics, resulting in distinct gradients of O-2,O- pH, and CO2 in the rhizosphere. A novel planar optode system (VisiSens TDR (R), PreSens GmbH) was used for taking high-resolution 2D-images of the O-2, pH, and CO2 distribution around roots during alternating light-dark cycles. Belowground sediment oxygenation was detected in the immediate vicinity of the roots, resulting in oxic root zones with a 1.7 mm radius from the root surface. CO2 accumulated around the roots, reaching a concentration up to threefold higher than the background concentration, and generally affected a larger area within a radius of 12.6 mm from the root surface. This contributed to a lowering of pH by 0.6 units around the roots. The O-2, pH, and CO2 distribution was recorded on the same individual roots over diurnal light cycles in order to investigate the interlinkage between sediment oxygenation and CO2 and pH patterns. In the rhizosphere, oxic root zones showed higher oxygen concentrations during illumination of the aboveground biomass. In darkness, intraspecific differences were observed, where some plants maintained oxic root zones in darkness, while others did not. However, the temporal variation in sediment oxygenation was not reflected in the temporal variations of pH and CO2 around the roots, which were unaffected by changing light conditions at all times. This demonstrates that plant-mediated sediment oxygenation fueling microbial decomposition and chemical oxidation has limited impact on the dynamics of pH and CO2 in S. anglica rhizospheres, which may in turn be controlled by other processes such as root respiration and root exudation.

AB  - Climate change is altering consumer- plant interactions in ecosystems worldwide. How consumers alter their spatial distribution, grazing activities, and functional morphology in response to climate stress can determine whether their effects on plants intensify or relax. Few studies have considered multiple consumer response metrics to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the resulting changes in consumer- plant interactions. Here, we tested how drought stress influences the interaction between the dominant consumer, the fungal-farming periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata, and a foundational plant, cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, in a southeastern US salt marsh. In a 4 mo field experiment, we maintained moderate snail densities in mesh control chambers and clear plastic climate chambers that simulated drought by elevating temperatures and drying soils. Monitoring revealed that snails more often congregated on cordgrass stems than leaves in climate chambers than in controls. Image analyses indicated that this behavioral shift corresponded to snails inflicting shorter, but more numerous, fungal-infested scars on cordgrass leaves, and causing less plant damage in climate chambers than controls. Coincident with their net reduction in grazing, snails maintained longer radulae, whose central teeth were blunter and lateral teeth were sharper, in climate chambers compared to controls. These results suggest that under drought, snail radulae may experience less frictional wear and that, at intermediate densities, snail-cordgrass interactions relax. Together with prior research showing that at high densities, snails can denude cordgrass during drought, we conclude that consumer density, behavior, and morphological responses must be integrated in predictions of how climate change will affect the direction, strength, and stability of consumer-plant interactions.

AB  - As an easy and relevant assessment within communities and arguably the most important in relating a species to its environment are its trophic interactions. Food webs and food chains offer visualizations of organismal connections, usually in direct predator-prey interactions. Nevertheless, indirect interactions and non-predator-prey interactions are also important. Food resources are primary niche dimensions in terms of resources used (i.e., energy, material, and sites). As parts of food webs, predator-prey relationships are the primary source of negative feedback loops that stabilize communities. Simple models are excellent for small point-in-time studies or parsing diets of particular species; however, when relating any study to a larger whole, the environmental factors are also necessary to reflect the reality of processes. Tides, seasons, and other events can play a significant role in the primary and secondary production of salt marshes due to ontogenetic shifts of some species to different trophic levels. However, many species can operate at multiple feeding levels, and though adults of a species might be listed as feeding at a higher trophic level, the species' major influence on its community might occur as a juvenile at a different trophic level.

AB  - The relationship between diet and feeding activity of intertidal crabs, and environmental cycles (tidal, daily and seasonal), habitat and level of the intertidal zone (high/low) was studied using Neohelice granulata (Brachyura, Varunidae) as a model. This is a semi-terrestrial burrowing crab occupying different habitats in the Southwestern Atlantic coasts and estuaries from bare low intertidal mudflats to high intertidal salt marshes, and from fine, organic matter rich sediment to very coarse sediment with low content of organic matter. The study was carried out in two contrasting habitats of three sites with diverse sets of physical and biological conditions. Diet and feeding of adult N. granulata were indirectly studied through the proportion of food items and the presence/absence of food in crab stomachs, respectively. This species has a dual mode of feeding: predominantly herbivorous (live plants or plant litter in salt marshes) or deposit feeder (superficial sediment and detritus in mudflats), but the quantity and quality of ingested food varies among habitats and sites. A trend to omnivory (including algae and conspecifics) was detected in relation to low quality of resources. Feeding activity modulated by a complex interaction of factors varied according to spatial and/or temporal changes in some natural cycles. Males and non-ovigerous females fed preferably after dark and during submersion periods, but also after emersion periods if mudflat sediment remained wet; salt marsh crab feeding is somewhat independent of light and tidal cycles. Ovigerous females almost never fed. Both diet and feeding activity of this crab seem to be flexible traits adapted to different combinations of physical and biological factors.

AB  - We report here that substantial quantities of dissolved dimethylsulfonioproprionate (DMSP) are released from live leaves of Spartina alterniflora in Georgia, USA salt marshes during tidal submergence. Mean monthly in situ foliar release rates varied from 0.092 +/- 0.050 to 0.291 +/- 0.289-mu-mol DMSP (g dry wt)-1 h-1. Estimates of tidal release of DMSP from creekbank stands of S. alterniflora varied from 46 +/- 3 to 684 +/- 411-mu-mol DMSP m-2 d-1 with annual losses of 114 mmol DMSP m-2 yr-1 (3.6 g S m-2 yr-1). Substantial quantities of DMSP accumulate on leaf surfaces. Extrafoliar DMSP accumulations on individual plants varied widely from undetectable to > 1-mu-mol (g dry wt)-1. Extrafoliar DMSP accumulations normalized to marsh surface area were generally less-than-or-equal-to 50-mu-mol m-2. Additions of DMSP to salt marsh creek water resulted in a rapid increase in dimethylsulfide (DMS) production. Foliar release of DMSP into tidal water from S. alterniflora may contribute to the production of DMS and related compounds in southeastern S. alterniflora marshes.

AB  - Studies addressing the role of large herbivores on nitrogen cycling in grasslands have suggested that the direction of effects depends on soil fertility. Via selection for high quality plant species and input of dung and urine, large herbivores have been shown to speed up nitrogen cycling in fertile grassland soils while slowing down nitrogen cycling in unfertile soils. However, recent studies show that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in some temperate fertile soils, but not in others. To explain this, we hypothesize that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in loamy or clay soils through soil compaction, but not in sandy soils. Especially under wet conditions, strong compaction in clay soils can lead to periods of soil anoxia, which reduces decomposition of soil organic matter and, hence, N mineralization. In this study, we use a long-term (37-year) field experiment on a salt marsh to investigate the hypothesis that the effect of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization depends on soil texture. Our results confirm that the presence of large herbivores decreased nitrogen mineralization rate in a clay soil, but not in a sandy soil. By comparing a hand-mown treatment with a herbivore-grazed treatment, we show that these differences can be attributed to herbivore-induced changes in soil physical properties rather than to above-ground biomass removal. On clay soil, we find that large herbivores increase the soil water-filled porosity, induce more negative soil redox potentials, reduce soil macrofauna abundance, and reduce decomposition activity. On sandy soil, we observe no changes in these variables in response to grazing. We conclude that effects of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization cannot be understood without taking soil texture, soil moisture, and feedbacks through soil macrofauna into account.

AB  - Rates and pathways of decomposition of three aliphatic amines (monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl amine) and three amino acids (alanine, glutamic acid, and lysine) were investigated in anoxic salt marsh sediments dominated by input from the saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora. Radiolabeled amines and amino acids added to sediments were either adsorbed or metabolized within 10-20 hours of addition. The proportion of added label that remained unmetabolized in the sediment solid phase was higher for amino acids than for amines. This is due to either the more reversible nature of amine than amino acid adsorption, or to a higher microbial incorporation to respiration ratio for the amines. Remineralization rate constants determined from model calculations are in the order MMA greater than or equal to DMA > TMA and ALA > GLU > LYS, consistent with the adsorption behavior of these compounds. Remineralization rate constants for the amino acids were 6-10 times higher than for the amines. Experiments using specific inhibitors and labeled substrates demonstrated that the decomposition of amines was mediated by methanogens, sulfate reducers, and other microbial groups, while amino acid remineralization occurred mainly through sulfate reduction. Methanogenesis was the primary pathway for consumption of TMA produced from Spartina-amended sediments.

AB  - Changes in photosynthetic and respiration rates in coastal marine habitats cause considerable variability in ecosystem metabolism on timescales ranging from diel to tidal to seasonal. Here, temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved oxygen (DO), carbonate chemistry, and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) were quantified from spring through fall in multiple, distinct, temperate estuarine habitats: seagrass meadows, salt marshes, an open water estuary, and a shallow water habitat dominated by benthic macroalgae. DO and pH(T) (total scale) measurements were made via high frequency sensor arrays coupled with discrete measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and high-resolution spatial mapping was used to document intra-habitat spatial variability. All habitats displayed clear diurnal patterns of pH(T) and DO that were stronger than tidal signals, with minimums and maximums observed during early morning and afternoon, respectively. Diel ranges in pH(T) and DO varied by site. In seagrass meadows and the open estuarine site, pH(T) ranged 7.8-8.4 and 7.5-8.2, respectively, while DO exceeded hypoxic thresholds and aragonite was typically saturated (omega(Ar) > 1). Conversely, pH(T) in a shallow macroalgal and salt marsh dominated habitats exhibited strong diel oscillations in pH(T) (6.9-8.4) with diel acidic (pH(T) < 7) and hypoxic (DO < 3 mg L-1) conditions often observed during summer along with extended periods of aragonite undersaturation (omega(Ar) < 1). The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) exceeded 3000 and 2000 mu atm in the salt marsh and macroalgal bed, respectively, while pCO(2) never exceeded 1000 mu atm in the seagrass and open estuarine site. Mesoscale (50-100 m) spatial variability was observed across sites with the lowest pH(T) and DO found within regions of more restricted flow. NEM across habitats ranged from net autotrophic (macroalgae and seagrass) to metabolically balanced (open water) and net heterotrophic (salt marsh). Each habitat exhibited distinct buffering capacities, varying seasonally, and modulated by adjacent biological activity and variations in total alkalinity (TA) and DIC. As future predicted declines in pH and DO are likely to shrink the spatial extent of estuarine refuges from acidification and hypoxia, efforts are required to expand seagrass meadows and the aquaculture of macroalgae to maximize their ecosystem benefits and maintain these estuarine refuges.

AB  - Methyl chloride (CH3CI) and methyl bromide (CH3Br) are the predominant carriers of natural chlorine and bromine from the troposphere to the stratosphere, which can catalyze the destruction of stratospheric ozone. Here, penguin colony soils (PCS) and the adjacent tundra soils (i.e., penguin-lacking colony soils, PLS), seal colony soils (SCS), tundra marsh soils (TMS), and normal upland tundra soils (UTS) in coastal Antarctica were collected and incubated for the first time to confirm that these soils were CH3Cl and CH3Br sources or sinks. Overall, tundra soil acted as a net sink for CH3Cl and CH3Br with potential flux ranges from -18.1 to -2.8 pmol g(-1) d(-1) and -1.32 to -0.24 pmol g(-1) d(-1), respectively. The deposition of penguin guano or seal excrement into tundra soils facilitated the simultaneous production of CH3Cl and CH3Br and resulted in a smaller sink in PCS, SCS, and PLS. Laboratory-based thermal treatments and anaerobic incubation experiments suggested that the consumption of CH3Cl and CH3Br was predominantly mediated by microbes while the production was abiotic and O-2 independent. Temperature gradient incubations revealed that increasing soil temperature promoted the consumption of CH3Cl and CH3Br in UTS, suggesting that the regional sink may increase with Antarctic warming, depending on changes in soil moisture and abiotic production rates.

AB  - Oysters can create reefs that provide habitat for associated species resulting in elevated resident abundances, lower mortality rates, and increased growth and survivorship compared to other estuarine habitats. However, there is a need to quantify trophic relationships and transfer at created oyster reefs to provide a better understanding of their potential in creating suitable nekton habitat. Stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were conducted to examine the organic matter sources and potential energy flow pathways at a created intertidal oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis; hereinafter, oyster) reef and adjacent salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary, China. The delta C-13 values of most reef-associated species (22 of 37) were intermediate between those of suspended particle organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMI), indicating that both POM and BMI are the major organic matter sources at the created oyster reef. The sessile and motile macrofauna colonizing the reef make up the main prey of transient nekton (e. g., spotted sea bass, Asian paddle crab, and green mud crab), thus suggesting that the associated community was most important in supporting higher trophic levels as opposed to the direct dietary subsidy of oysters. The created oyster reef consistently supported higher trophic levels than the adjacent salt marsh habitat due to the dominance of secondary consumers. These results indicate that through the provision of habitat for associated species, created oyster reefs provide suitable habitat and support a higher average trophic level than adjacent salt marsh in the Yangtze River estuary.

AB  - The interactions among Spartina patens and sediment microbial populations and the interactions among Phragmites australis and sediment microbial populations were studied at monotypic sites in Piermont Marsh, a salt marsh of the Hudson River north of New York N.Y., at key times during the growing season. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) effectively colonized S. patens but not P. australis, and there were seasonal increases and decreases that coincided with plant growth and senescence (17 and 6% of the S. patens root length were colonized, respectively). In sediment samples from the Spartina site, the microbial community and specific bacterial populations were at least twice as large in terms of number and biomass as the microbial community and specific bacterial populations in sediment samples from the Phragmites site, and peak values occurred during reproduction. Members of the domain Bacteria, especially members of the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subdivisions of the Proteobacteria, were the most abundant organisms at both sites throughout the growing season. The populations were generally more dynamic in samples from the Spartina site than in samples from the Phragmites site. No differences between the two sites and no differences during the growing season were observed when restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of nifH amplicons were performed in an attempt to detect shifts in the diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Differences were observed only in the patterns generated by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR for samples from the Spartina site, suggesting that there were differences in the overall and active populations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Regression analyses indicated that there was a positive interaction between members of the 8-subdivision of the Proteobacteria and root biomass but not between members of the delta-subdivision of the Proteobacteria and macroorganic matter at both sites. In samples from the Spartina site, there were indications that there were bacterium-fungus interactions since populations of members of the a-subdivision of the Proteobacteria were negatively associated with AMF colonization and populations of members of the gamma-subdivision of the Proteobacteria were positively associated with AMF colonization.

AB  - The La Perroche marsh is a small Holocene marsh on the south-western coast of the Oleron island (Bay of Biscay, France) presently occupied by a freshwater swamp and separated from the ocean by a continuous sand dune ridge. The study of its infill shows first basal conglomeratic deposits with calcareous pebbles on a Cenomanian rough substrate. The Holocene infill since 6000 years BP begins with a very fast sedimentation of sands. Then, the sedimentation becomes finer, with lagoonal to freshwater influences recorded by ostracods. The distribution of these deposits inside the marsh is asymmetric, with a thick sandy-gravely layer in the eastern part and a succession of sands, clays and organic layers in the western part. Communication with the sea is episodic, and the sedimentation is controlled by an active channel, as shown by the presence of displaced coastal-marine faunas at some sites. Around 5000 years BP, a coastal marsh began to develop with high organic matter contents. These organic deposits presently outcrop on the beach, suggesting a more seaward location of the shoreline at that time. Generally, these sediments are azoic. When fauna is present, it indicates brackish to freshwater environments showing a progressive isolation of the system. A second phase of terrigenous sedimentation occurred after a transgressive event around 2800-2500 years BP, but the communication with the sea was then very reduced, as indicated by mainly freshwater faunas. This transgressive event appears to be synchronous with a positive sea-level tendency recorded, throughout north-western European coasts, between 3000 and 2000 years BP. The definitive closing of the marsh occurred around 2100 years BP, after a second phase of freshwater marsh. (C) 2001 Ifremer/CNRS/IRD/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Mediterranean salt marsh macroinvertebrate assemblages are abiotically filtered due to harsh environmental conditions. We hypothesized that in these environmentally fluctuating systems, biotic interactions would have more relevance than abiotic ones and that size-based interactions would dominate. The manuscript focuses on the response to biotic and abiotic factors of 2 diversity metrics: (1) one that relies on species identity (Shannon-Wiener diversity), and (2) another based on the shape of biomass size spectra (size diversity). Benthic macroinvertebrates (organisms >1 mm) were the target group of this study and were sampled monthly in 6 basins during 2 flooding cycles (from October 1997 to July 1999). The high inter-annual variability characteristic of Mediterranean systems revealed the robustness of the observed patterns. Abiotic and biotic interactions appeared to be significant for both diversity metrics, with species diversity more abiotically controlled than size diversity. The relationships between size diversity and environmental variables were more interannually stable than those for species diversity. Only water total organic carbon had a robust relationship with species diversity, but dissolved inorganic nitrogen and predatory pressure had a robust relationship with size diversity. Additionally, size diversity had a significant succession pattern related to days after flooding (time), whereas species diversity did not. Our results suggest that in abiotically filtered environments, macroinvertebrate size-based interactions become especially relevant.

AB  - A net annual budget of nutrients and particulate suspended sediment was assessed in the Fier-d'Ars Bay (French Atlantic Coast). The model indicated a net import of particulate matter with the dominance of mineral form exceeding 90 % of the total particulate matter. Regarding the dissolved nutrient, the bay acted differently: a particular import of DOC and DIN was assessed in the upper part of the bay, whereas an export was indicated at the bay-ocean interface. Negative and positive feedbacks were indicated between water column constituent processing and the geomorphology of the system, the tidal dynamics, the primary producers and the decomposition of the organic matter.

AB  - Population growth and industrialization involve environmental problems, such as metal pollution, and coastal environments are particularly susceptible to such issues. Within this framework, we aimed: (i) to determine the levels of trace metals in soils and Spartina densiflora tissues in rocky shore marshes of Central Patagonia; (ii) to relate metal concentration patterns in the different soil-plant complex fractions to environmental conditions; and (iii) to investigate whether geographical metal concentration patterns can be explained with anthropogenic influences and sources and/or by local prevailing biogeochemical processes. For this purpose, soil samples and associated vegetation were collected in five rocky shore marshes located at different distances from an urban or industrial area. The concentration of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in soils (pseudototal and bioavailable) and in plants (roots and shoots) was determined. Then the enrichment factor, bioaccumulation and translocation factor were calculated. The soil mineralogy and the behavior of these metals according to different soil variables were discussed. The results showed different behavior and level of anthropic impact according to the metal considered. Salt marshes located on the southern edge of the Nuevo Gulf showed the highest concentrations of metals. Fe, Al, Cu and Zn showed mostly a natural origin. Fe and Al were mainly in soils rather than in plants, while Cu and Zn were similarly distributed in both matrixes. Although Cd in soils showed enrichment, it would have a natural origin. Also, it was scarce in the soil and was mostly concentrated in Spartina' roots. Pb, Cr and Ni showed anthropic enrichment too, being mainly derived from the port and industrial activities. Pb had significant representation in all soil-plant subsystems and showed the highest bioavailability in soils. Cr and Ni, were found in high concentration in the soil and showed a high bioaccumulation in roots. The human impact level in rocky shore marshes of the Nuevo Gulf in Central Patagonia associated to the trace metals pollution varies from being scarce to significantly important, with the marshes located in its southern margin showing the worst scenarios.

AB  - More than two-thirds of global biomass consists of vascular plants. A portion of the detritus they generate is carried into the oceans from land and highly productive blue carbon ecosystems-salt marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass meadows. This large detrital input receives scant attention in current models of the global carbon cycle, though for blue carbon ecosystems, increasingly well-constrained estimates of biomass, productivity, and carbon fluxes, reviewed in this article, are now available. We show that the fate of this detritus differs markedly from that of strictly marine origin, because the former contains lignocellulose-an energy-rich polymer complex of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin that is resistant to enzymatic breakdown. This complex can be depolymerized for nutritional purposes by specialized marine prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and invertebrates using enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases to release sugar monomers. The lignin component, however, is less readily depolymerized, and detritus therefore becomes lignin enriched, particularly in anoxic sediments, and forms a major carbon sink in blue carbon ecosystems. Eventual lignin breakdown releases a wide variety of small molecules that may contribute significantly to the oceanic pool of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. Marine carbon fluxes and sinks dependent on lignocellulosic detritus are important ecosystem services that are vulnerable to human interventions. These services must be considered when protecting blue carbon ecosystems and planning initiatives aimed at mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers affect different organisms and processes in multiple ways at different spatial scales. Moreover, similar species may differ in their engineering effects for reasons that are not always clear. We examined the role of four species of burrowing crabs (Sesarma reticulatum, Eurytium limosum, Panopeus herbstii, Uca pugnax) in engineering tidal creek networks in salt marshes experiencing sea level rise. In the field, crab burrows were associated with heads of eroding creeks and the loss of plant (Spartina alterniflora) stems. S. reticulatum was closely associated with creek heads, but densities of the other crab species did not vary across marsh zones. In mesocosm experiments, S. reticulatum excavated the most soil and strongly reduced S. alterniflora biomass. The other three species excavated less and did not affect S. alterniflora. Creek heads with vegetation removed to simulate crab herbivory grew significantly faster than controls. Percolation rates of water into marsh sediments were 10 times faster at creek heads than on the marsh platform. Biomass decomposed two times faster at creek heads than on the marsh platform. Our results indicate that S. reticulatum increases creek growth by excavating sediments and by consuming plants, thereby increasing water flow and erosion at creek heads. Moreover, it is possible that S. reticulatum burrows also increase creek growth by increasing surface and subsurface erosion, and by increasing decomposition of organic matter at creek heads. Our results show that the interaction between crab and plant ecosystem engineers can have both positive and negative effects. At a small scale, in contrast to other marsh crabs, S. reticulatum harms rather than benefits plants, and increases erosion rather than marsh growth. At a large scale, however, S. reticulatum facilitates the drainage efficiency of the marsh through the expansion of tidal creek networks, and promotes marsh health.

AB  - Past studies have suggested that desiccation enhances hydrophobicity of salt marsh sediment, and that drying and rewetting sediment can be used to investigate sorption mechanisms of amino acids and other organic compounds [Liu, Z., Lee, C., 2006. Drying effects on sorption capacity of coastal sediment: The importance of architecture and polarity of organic matter. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 70, 3313-3324]. Here we further develop this technique to study sorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic compounds in a wide range of marine sediments. Our results show that hydrophilic compounds sorb strongly to wet coastal sediments; in dried sediments, sorption of hydrophilic compounds decreases, while sorption of hydrophobic compounds is greatly enhanced. Small compounds with aromatic rings sorb more in dried than wet coastal sediments, suggesting that aromatic groups have a stronger effect on sorption than polar groups like amino and carboxyl moieties. Sorption of lysine, glutamic acid and putrescine decreases greatly when sediment is pretreated with KCl, indicating the importance of cation ion exchange. However, alpha-amino acids sorb much more than corresponding beta- or -gamma-amino acids, and L-alanine sorbs more than D-alanine, suggesting that amino group location and chiral selectivity play an important role in sorption. Comparison of lysine and tyrosine sorption in different sediments indicates that source and diagenetic state of organic matter are important factors determining sorption capacity. Lysine sorbs much more to organic detritus from salt marsh sediment than to fresh Spartina root materials, marine particles, lignin or hurnic acids, indicating the importance of structural integrity in sorption. Desorption hysteresis of glutamic acid, putrescine and lysine (in dried sediment) suggests the presence of enzyme-type sorption sites of high sorption energy or multiple binding mechanisms. Taken together, these findings suggest that organic matter plays the major role in amino acid sorption in organic-rich sediments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - A net material flux study in an estuarine mudflat along the French Atlantic coast, confirmed the general hypothesis already shown in European salt marshes. Despite its small area, the system was not as homogeneous as first thought. The upper part of thr hay imported both dissolved and particulate matter, whereas the lower part exported dissolved and imported particulate matter. Tidal dynamics and water residence time were suspected of enhancing these differences. Particulate mineral import represented more than 70% of the total suspended sediment, with export of silicate, dissolved organic carbon and chlorophyll a. It is assumed that phytoplankton and microphytobenthos were exported from the bay in a degraded form. A wide synthesis was conducted integrating the tidal physical dynamics, with the geomorphology of the system, to explain material flux differences between the two sampling sites. Differences of particulate material transport between European and North American systems were verified. New hypotheses relative to the functional role of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos in coastal food chains in European salt marshes were also investigated. In contrast to American systems, mineral particulate import was prevalent in European ecosystems, enhancing growth of small-celled phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. These latter, were sorbed onto sedimenting mineral particles, thus limiting losses from estuaries and explaining the major particulate retention in these systems. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Much of North America's tidal marsh habitat has been significantly altered by both natural and man-made processes. Thus, there is a need to understand the trophic ecology of organisms endemic to these ecosystems. We applied carbon (delta (13)C) and nitrogen (delta (15)N) stable isotope analysis, along with isotope mixing models, to egg yolk, liver, and muscle tissues of clapper rails (Rallus longirostris) and their likely prey items. This analysis enabled us to explore variation in trophic niche and diet composition in this important marsh bird in two northern Gulf of Mexico tidal marshes that are river and ocean-dominated. For the river-associated estuary, delta (13)C and delta (15)N of egg yolks, liver, and pectoral muscle tissue samples provided evidence that clapper rails maintained a similar diet during both the winter and the breeding season. A trophic link between C(3) primary productivity and the clapper rail's diet was also indicated as the delta (13)C of clapper rail egg yolks related negatively with the aerial cover of C(3) macrophytes. Clapper rails from the ocean-dominated estuary had a narrower trophic niche and appeared to be utilizing marine resources, particularly, based on modeling of liver stable isotope values. Variation in stable isotope values between egg yolk and liver/muscle in both systems suggests that endogenous resources are important for egg production in clapper rails. These results demonstrate that diet composition, prey source, and niche width of clapper rails can vary significantly across different estuaries and appear to be influenced by hydrological conditions.

AB  - The 2010 BP oil spill has an unprecedented impact on coastal wetland ecosystem along the northern Gulf of Mexico. A two-dimensional analysis (dispersant concentration and duration of exposure) was conducted by pre-incubation of a salt marsh sediment under an open or closed condition. Denitrification activity was characterized by N2O production using an acetylene (C2H2) blockage technique, and organic matter (OM) mineralization by CO2 production. The results show that even trace amount of the dispersant could significantly inhibit the denitrification activity by 20% (p <0.05). However, the sediment was resilient to the oil/dispersant contamination, likely due to shift of its microbial communities, by recovering the denitrification activity within 46 days in the open incubation. Inhibitory effect of the oil/dispersant on denitrification persisted beyond 46 days in the closed incubation, and the recovery could take up to 137 days depending on the dispersant concentration. The dispersant continuously stimulated OM mineralization that lowered the sediment redox status. Mobilization of N in the sediment from the OM mineralization forms a positive feedback loop, leading to deterioration of the coastal ecosystem. The study concludes that minimum dispersant should be applied for oil spill remediation, and oil cleanup operations should avoid moving the oil/dispersant from surface into deeper layers of the sediment. Synergistic interactions between the crude oil and dispersant and their biodegradation products deserves future examinations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the persistence of Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) in a typical breeding site of the mosquito Ochlerotatus caspius in a particularly sensitive salt marsh ecosystem following two Bti-based larvicidal applications (Vectobac (R) 12AS, 1.95 L/ha). The treated area was composed of four larval biotopes that differed in terms of the most representative plant species (Sarcocornia fruticosa, Bolboschoenus maritimus, Phragmites australis, and Juncus maritimus) and the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil. We sampled water, soil, and plants at various times before and after the applications (from spring to autumn, 2001) and quantified the spores of B. thuringiensis (Bt) and Bacillus species. The B. cereus group accounted for between 0% and 20% of all Bacillus spp. before application depending on the larval biotope. No Bti were found before application. The variation in the quantity of bacilli during the mosquito breeding season depended more on the larval biotope than on the season or the larvicidal application. More bacilli were found in soil (10(4)-10(6) spores/g) than on plant samples (10(2)-10(4) spores/g). The abundance in water (10(5) to 10(7) spores/L) appeared to be correlated to the water level of the breeding site. The number of Bti spores increased just after application, after declining; no spores were detected in soil or water 3 months after application. However, low numbers of Bti spores were present on foliage from three of the four studied plant strata. In conclusion, the larvicidal application has very little impact on Bacillus spp. flora after one breeding season (two applications).

AB  - Coastal wetlands are responsible for about half of all carbon burial in oceans, and their persistence as a valuable ecosystem depends largely on the ability to accumulate organic material at rates equivalent to relative sea level rise. Recent work suggests that elevated CO2 and temperature warming will increase organic matter productivity and the ability of marshes to survive sea level rise. However, we find in a series of preliminary experiments that organic decomposition rates increase by about 20% per degree of warming. Our measured temperature sensitivity is similar to studies from terrestrial systems, three times as high as the response of salt marsh productivity to temperature warming, and greater than the productivity response associated with elevated CO2 in C-3 marsh plants. Although the experiments were simple and of short duration, they suggest that enhanced CO2 and warmer temperatures could actually make marshes less resilient to sea level rise, and tend to promote a release of soil carbon. Simple projections indicate that elevated temperatures will increase rates of sea level rise more than any acceleration in organic matter accumulation, suggesting the possibility of a positive feedback between climate, sea level rise, and carbon emissions in coastal environments.

AB  - Water collected from riverine, near coastal, and salt marsh sources in the Southeastern United States was evaluated for its ability to produce both carbon monoxide (CO) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) by photochemical oxidation of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Irradiation of whole water samples using simulated sunlight produced CO at rates similar to those measured previously.  Production rates for DIC were more than an order of magnitude higher than those observed for CO.  Based on observed DIC formation rates, photo-oxidation of DOC by sunlight should be considered a dominant removal mechanism of organic carbon from the ocean.

AB  - The composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an estuary characterized by extensive salt marsh vegetation was investigated at the molecular level using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and stable carbon isotope analyses. Samples from multiple seasons covered different hydrological regimes, including anomalously low-discharge conditions. The untargeted approach used allowed for identifying the DOM molecular signatures associated with different DOM sources in the estuary. DOM composition was strongly modulated by river discharge at monthly scales, with high river flow leading to significant increases in the terrigenous signature of the DOM throughout the estuary. During a severe/exceptional drought, estuarine DOM was imprinted with a distinct signature of marsh-derived compounds. The frequency of occurrence of anomalously low-discharge conditions seems to have increased over the last decades. If predictions of anthropogenically driven changes in hydroclimate are confirmed, they will likely be accompanied by changes in DOM composition in estuaries at multidecadal time scales.

AB  - Relationships between flooding frequency, flooding duration, litter moisture levels, and litter decay rates were investigated across the natural hydrologic gradient common to intertidal salt marshes. The effects on litter decay of natural and experimental alterations of litter moisture content were assessed in both field litterbag experiments (conducted in a southern New Jersey salt marsh from 1989 to 1990) and laboratory incubations (1990). Overall, tidally mediated litter moisture content was the dominant factor controlling litter decay throughout the vegetated marsh. Rates of carbon loss were most closely related to litter moisture levels (r = 0.84), which were directly related to flooding frequency (r = 0.66) and duration (r = 0.63). Litter moisture levels were related to elevation within the tidal range due to increasing surface elevation from creekbank to high marsh (ca. 54 cm) and height of litter above the sediment surface. Carbon losses from litter of short and tall form Spartina alterniflora Loisel. and S. patens (Aiton) Muhl. along the marsh elevation gradient indicate that while some of the variations in decay rates may be due to litter type, litter moisture accounted for most of the observed variation between marsh zones and within each litter type. Moisture levels are also affected by the water retention capacity of each litter type, which may also secondarily influence decay rates. Short-term incubations of litter indicated that CO2 evolution was positively related to moisture content with negligible respiration at moisture levels below 15% (fresh mass), increasing to a maximum between 65 and 7.5% depending upon litter type. Since most Spartina spp. litter remains above the marsh surface where it maintains a lower moisture content than surface litter, the use of surface litterbags may overestimate rates of carbon loss in some systems. In addition, since changes in elevation of only a few centimeters had significant effects on both litter moisture levels and decay rates, slight changes in tidal regime may have important consequences for organic matter cycling in salt marshes by affecting litter decomposition processes.

AB  - Sediment and nutrient burial in tidal marshes of Barnegat Bay was investigated using age-dated sediment cores collected along a north-to-south transect. Measurements of radionuclides (Pb-210 and Cs-137) and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) were accompanied by nutrient and organic matter concentrations. Sediment accumulation rates, measured using Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronology, ranged from 48 to 81 mg cm(2) y(-1), whereas corresponding accretion rates ranged from 0.16 to 0.30 cm y(-1). Sediment nitrogen (N) accumulation rates increased twofold at an upper bay site, starting in the mid-1950s, whereas at other locations, only small to no increases were seen with time. Phosphorus (P) accumulation was minimal with time. N and P accumulation rates were higher between the 1940s to 1950s at stations BB-1 and BB-3, while higher accumulation rate in the down-bay (BB-4) was identified in the early 1990s. Results indicate that bay marshes can sequester approximately 79 +/- 11% of N and 54 +/- 34% of P entering the Bay from upland sources; thus, these marshes perform an important ecosystem service in the form of nutrient sequestration. Marsh accretion rates at the coring sites fall at, to just below, rates of relative sea-level rise recorded by nearby tide gauges. These relatively low rates of accretion render the marsh vulnerable to inundation should the rate of sea-level rise accelerate in the future.

AB  - Retreat and progradation make the edges of salt marsh platforms their most active features. If we have a single topographic snapshot of a marsh, is it possible to tell if some areas have retreated or prograded recently or if they are likely to do so in the future? We explore these questions by characterising marsh edge topography in mega-tidal Moricambe Bay (UK) in 2009, 2013 and 2017. We first map outlines of marsh platform edges based on lidar data and from these we generate transverse topographic profiles of the marsh edge 10 m long and 20 m apart. By associating profiles with individual retreat or progradation events, we find that they produce distinct profiles when grouped by change event, regardless of event magnitude. Progradation profiles have a shallow scarp and low relief that decreases with event magnitude, facilitating more progradation. Conversely, steep-scarped, high-relief retreat profiles dip landward as retreat reveals older platforms. Furthermore, vertical accretion of the marsh edge is controlled by elevation rather than its lateral motion, suggesting an even distribution of deposition that would allow bay infilling were it not limited by the migration of creeks. While we demonstrate that marsh edges can be quantified with currently available DTMs, oblique observations are crucial to fully describe scarps and better inform their sensitivity to wave and current erosion.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on earth because of their high ecological and economic value. On the central Gulf Coast of Mexico, there are numerous coastal wetlands, although 58% of their area has been lost or degraded due to management activities, among them raising livestock. Globally, little is known about the effect of this activity on hydromorphic soils of herbaceous wetlands, and in Mexico, there is even less knowledge. This study assessed the degree of impact of livestock on soil physicochemical properties of the coastal marshes of Alvarado, in the south of Veracruz. In four sampling sites (two organic and two with mineral soils) with different levels of impact, soil samples were taken during one year to obtain data on variables such as bulk density, total porosity, organic matter, pH, and nutrients. At sites where the stocking was low, cattle were rotated once a year and the hydrology was unaltered, and soil hydromorphic intrinsic properties were preserved. The results of this study should be considered in the development of strategies for the management and conservation of these tropical ecosystems, as a means to achieve sustainable livestock farming in wetlands.

AB  - A field study was carried out in two typical marsh wetlands (Sites A and B) with different flooding frequencies in the Yellow River Delta of China in three different dates to investigate spatial and temporal distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) along the distance away from one tidal creek and the Yellow River, respectively. The results showed that SOC and TN contents and densities generally decreased with depth, except for an obvious accumulation peak of TN at the 2040?cm soil layer; and they had higher heterogeneity at both Sites A and B; However, SOC and TN contents and densities showed different spatial distribution patterns at both sites in different sampling dates. Generally, SOC and TN contents in marsh soils were higher at Site A than those at Site B. TN was significantly correlated with available phosphorous, SOC, and the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio at both sites, whereas SOC was significantly correlated with soil depth, soil moisture and salinity at both sites. Additionally, the C/N ratios were higher at Site B than those at Site A, and they were significantly correlated with soil moisture (Site A), bulk density, and TN (Sites A and B).

AB  - It is often difficult to explain the importance of wetlands for economic development since these are places filled with water and, apparently, without immediate utility. In this paper, we will bring light to some aspects related to mangroves, salt marshes, and peatlands in Brazil. From the complexities involving wetlands definition and proper location all throughout the country, the worldwide importance of Brazilian Mangroves which could sum-up to nearly 8% of world area of this ecosystem, to the importance of salt marshes to carbon sequestration and its storage into the ocean's deep-waters and the peat soils (Organossolos) distributed in the entire continental area of the country, from low coastal areas (0 m) to mountains regions (2000 m), from northern-tropical to southern-temperate climates, we will seek to pinpoint some threats to these fragile environments, the controversy regarding their proper quantification and some possibilities for future research.

AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive species originating from North America, has spread widely along the eastern coast of China. However, the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on CH4 and N2O fluxes from salt marshes in eastern China are not fully understood. We conducted a field experiment in three treatments (transparent, opaque, and clipping) to compare the CH4 and N2O fluxes from S. alterniflora community with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities and the mudflat in a coastal wetland of eastern China over one year. CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora community was higher than the S. salsa community and mudflat but lower than the P. australis community. The opaque treatment did not significantly alter CH4 flux, except for the S. salsa community. Clipping significantly decreased CH4 flux from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but increased CH4 flux from the S. salsa community. In contrast, N2O fluxes in the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities were lower than for the S. salsa community and mudflat. The opaque treatment did not significantly change N2O fluxes across communities. Clipping significantly increased mean N2O fluxes from the S. alterniflora and P. australis communities but did not significantly change N2O flux in the S. salsa community. CH4 flux was positively related to the aboveground biomass and negatively related to density, whereas N2O flux was negatively related to aboveground biomass and positively related to density. Meanwhile, CH4 flux was strongly dependent on temperature, soil moisture and water depth (P < 0.05), while N2O fluxes under the transparent and opaque chambers were significantly related to water depth (P < 0.05), but N2O flux under the clipping treatment was not significantly related to environmental factors (P > 0.05). Overall, CH4 and N2O fluxes from this coastal wetland were 17.38g m (2) and -36.64 mg m (2), respectively, indicating that S. alterniflora invasions in this salt marsh in eastern China could play a negligible role in emitting CH4 and a significant role in absorbing N2O when compared with other studies worldwide.

AB  - We quantified the effects of invasive Phragmites australis on estuarine faunal communities using meta-analysis to compare invaded to uninvaded marshes and then evaluated whether ecological restoration could reverse those effects. Relative to uninvaded marshes, the quantity and condition of fauna in invaded marshes was significantly poorer. We detected negative impacts to fauna residing in the mid-Atlantic but not in New England and to fauna utilizing the marsh surface but not to those inhabiting tidal creeks. By taxonomic group, we found that the invasion negatively affected nekton but not invertebrates. Both adult and sub-adult nekton were adversely affected, although the magnitude of the effect on the sub-adults was four times greater than that for adults. Our results indicate that negative effects on fauna within the mid-Atlantic region largely drove the overall results. When restored marshes were compared to uninvaded marshes there were no significant differences across all metrics assessed, suggesting that the negative impacts of the invasion were reversed. A separate qualitative review of trophic data indicated that benthic microalgae and dominant vascular plants are important primary producers at the base of the food web in uninvaded, invaded, and restored salt marshes but the overall quantity and importance of microalgae to diet decreased in highly invaded systems due to decreased light, potentially reducing energy availability. Our analyses revealed that while estuarine communities are adversely affected by P. australis, impacts vary by region, habitat, taxonomic group, and life history stage and that restoration can reverse long-term effects over relatively short time scales.

AB  - Extracellular peptide hydrolysis rates were measured in seawater and sediment from Flax Pond salt marsh using peptide analogs (LYA-peptides) as substrates. This technique allows the direct measurement of specific hydrolysis products and thus provides insights into enzymatic hydrolysis pathways. In sediments, hydrolysis rate constants of LYA-peptides varied seasonally and with depth. Highest activity was found in spring and summer, and most cores exhibited a subsurface maximum. Calculations using the concentrations of chemically-measured peptides suggested that extracellular hydrolysis of peptides is faster than the rate of free amino acids uptake. However, not all peptides may be available for enzymatic hydrolysis. In both seawater and sediment, extracellular hydrolysis of peptides of up to 8 amino acids yielded smaller peptides and free amino acids. Hydrolysis rates depended on size of the peptide substrate, although a clear relationship with number of amino acid constituents was not evident. Peptides containing > 2 amino acids were hydrolyzed 10-400 times faster than dipeptides or the fluorogenic substrate Leucine-MCA. Thus, dipeptidases are either uncommon in nature, or hydrolysis is carried out by nonspecific hydrolases that with a low affinity for dipeptides. This is also suggested by the presence of a lag time before dipeptide hydrolysis begins, and the absence of dipeptide hydrolysis in 0.2-mu m-filtered. One implication of this finding is that measurements of hydrolysis rates using substrates like Leu-MCA may not accurately predict the magnitude of hydrolysis rates of macromolecules in the marine environment. Even though dipeptide hydrolysis is slow compared to that of larger peptides, LYA-dipeptides are preferentially produced from the hydrolysis of larger substrates. LYA-dipeptides do not penetrate cell membranes of microorganism because of their size, but natural dipeptides are smaller and can be transported across the cell membrane. Since dipeptides do not appear to accumulate in natural waters, they must be rapidly removed by microorganisms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burrowing crabs are main constituent of estuarine wetlands ecosystems, and provide a variety of ecosystem functions including providing food for waterbirds and fishes, promoting nutrients cycling, and processing sediments deposition. Helice tientsinensis is the dominant crab species which inhabits almost the entire intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta. However, for a long time we ignored the crab bioturbation in this area. We know little about whether crabs have potential effects on sediment environment. Here, we investigated the crab burrow characteristics in three marsh zones, and we also analysed the sediment parameters among crab burrow mounds (chimneys), flats (flat areas between burrows), controls (outside of crab bed) and crab fecal deposit. We found that sediment was softer in crab burrow mounds than in flat and control areas. Higher crab density indicates softer sediment. Crab burrow mounds had saltier soil than the flats. Our results showed that sediment total nitrogen, total carbon and organic matter varied among mounds, flats, controls and crab fecal deposit, which indicated that crab bioturbation have potential effects on sediments redistribution and nutrients cycling. Our study is essential to clear the roles of crabs in ecosystems and will benefit for coastal saltmarsh protection and restoration.

AB  - Excess reactive nitrogen (N) flows from agricultural, suburban, and urban systems to coasts, where it causes eutrophication. Coastal wetlands take up some of this N, thereby ameliorating the impacts on nearshore waters. Although the consequences of N on coastal wetlands have been extensively studied, the effect of the specific form of N is not often considered. Both oxidized N forms (nitrate, NO3-) and reduced forms (ammonium, NH4+) can relieve nutrient limitation and increase primary production. However, unlike NH4+, NO3- can also be used as an electron acceptor for microbial respiration. We present results demonstrating that, in salt marshes, microbes use NO3- to support organic matter decomposition and primary production is less stimulated than when enriched with reduced N. Understanding how different forms of N mediate the balance between primary production and decomposition is essential for managing coastal wetlands as N enrichment and sea level rise continue to assail our coasts.

AB  - Seasonal growth responses of plants and soil microorganisms to additions of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) were examined in goose-grazed and exclosed plots in an Arctic salt marsh. Plants showed strong growth responses to N and NP additions but not to P. Nitrogen levels in the shoots and roots of Puccinellia phryganodes declined as summer progressed. Microbial biomass was low in spring in spite of N and P additions, likely due to C limitation, but values rose in autumn, independent of nutrient treatment, as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased. Glucose addition (C source) elicited a transitory increase in microbial biomass. Multiple plant defoliations by geese had a negative effect on microbial biomass, in spite of the presence of DOC and added N and P, possibly because hypersalinity restricted growth. Plants appear to limit soil inputs of C in summer and compete effectively for resources in contrast to autumn, indicating a temporal partitioning of resources.

AB  - Ecological attributes were measured along a chronosequence of 1- to 28-yr-old, constructed Spartina alterniflora marshes to identify trajectories and rates of ecosystem development of wetland structure and function. Attributes related to biological productivity and diversity (Spartina, epiphytic and sediment algae, benthic invertebrates), soil development (sediment deposition, organic C, N, P, organic matter quality), and microbial processes (C mineralization) were compared among eight constructed marshes and eight paired natural reference marshes. Most ecological attributes developed in a predictable manner over time, and most achieved equivalence to natural marshes 5-15 yr after marsh construction. An exception was soil organic C and N pools (0-30 cm) that, after 28 yr, were significantly lower in constructed marshes. Development of habitat structure (Spartina stem height and density) and biodiversity (algae and invertebrates) developed concurrently with functional characteristics such as biomass, chlorophyll a, and invertebrate density. Processes related to hydrology, sediment deposition and soil C and N accumulation, developed almost instantaneously with the establishment of Spartina, and young (1- to 3-yr-old), constructed marshes trapped sediment and sequestered N at higher rates than comparable reference marshes. Development of heterotrophic activity (C mineralization, invertebrate density) was strongly linked to surface (0-10 cm) soil organic C content. Ecosystem development of constructed (and natural) salt marshes depended on a minimum of 100 9 N/m(2) (0.05-0.1% N) to support emergent vegetation and 1000 g C/m(2) (0.5-1% C) to sustain the heterotrophic community.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of P in saline Spolic Technosols flooded with eutrophic water, with and without plant rhizosphere, in order to assess the role of these soils as sinks or sources of this nutrient.
   Samples were taken from basic (pH 7.8), carbonated and acidic (pH 6.2), de-carbonated soils of salt marshes polluted by mine wastes. Three treatments were assayed: pots with Sarcocornia fruticosa, pots with Phragmites australis and pots without plants (bare soil). The pots were flooded for 15 weeks with eutrophic water (PO (4) (3-) 6.92 mg L-1) and pH, Eh and water-soluble organic carbon and PO (4) (3-) concentrations were monitored in the soil solution. A soil P fractionation was applied before and after the flooding period.
   The PO (4) (3-) concentration in the soil solution decreased rapidly in both soils, with and without plant, being diminished by 80-90 % after 3 h of flooding. The Fe/Mn/Al oxides and the Ca/Mg compounds played an important role in soil P retention. In pots with S. fruticosa, the reductive conditions due to flooding induced P release from metal oxides and P retention to Ca/Mg compounds. In turn, P. australis may have favoured the release of P from carbonates, which was transferred to Fe/Mn/Al compounds.
   The retention of P by the soil was the main mechanism involved in the removal of PO (4) (3-) from the eutrophic flooding water but to evaluate the capacity of these systems as long-term P sinks, the combined effect of metals, Ca/Mg compounds and specific plant species should be considered.

AB  - Sea-level rise is leading to the migration of marshes into coastal forests throughout North America. Marsh migration represents a primary mechanism for marsh survival in the face of sea-level rise and leads to a fundamental reorganization of vegetation communities. Yet, the ecological implications of these changes remain unknown. To evaluate the effect of marsh migration on ecosystem function, we compared habitat, primary production, vertical accretion, nutrient cycling, and carbon accumulation between new and old salt marsh on Goodwin Island (Virginia, USA) where salt marsh is migrating landward into rapidly retreating coastal forest. Using historical imagery and radioisotopic dating of sediment cores, we determined marsh age (< 3 to approximately 616 years) across the landscape. We found that salt marsh functions generally depended more on elevation and/or landscape position than marsh age. Primary production and nutrient cycling (%C and %N soil content) did not vary significantly with marsh age. Accretion and carbon accumulation rates varied predictably with elevation in old marsh but not in new marsh. Instead, trends in soil formation were controlled by the colonization of Phragmites australis, a dominant plant in migrating marsh-forest boundaries along the Atlantic Coast. Vegetation zonation patterns were more clearly defined in old marsh, indicating that habitat types take time to develop. However, these vegetation differences did not translate to consistently different ecological functions. These observations suggest that marsh migration does not lead to permanent differences in ecological functions between new and old marsh, rather ecological functions will converge as new marsh ages.

AB  - Our test of the hypothesis that biomass and nitrogen would increase with more species-rich plantings simultaneously vegetated a salt marsh restoration site and demonstrated that on average, randomly chosen, 6-species plantings accumulated more biomass and nitrogen than the mean for 0- and 1-species assemblages, with the mean for 3-species assemblages being intermediate. In addition, we found that individual species (from the pool of eight native halophytes) differed in their functional capacity, with Salicornia virginica (Sv) and Jaumea carnosa contributing the greatest biomass when planted alone, while Triglochin concinna had the highest tissue N concentrations. When planted alone, Sv accumulated comparable amounts of biomass and nitrogen as in the multispecies plots, indicating that individual species can have a large effect on particular functions. Soil TKN in the surface 0-5 cm was greater in 6-species plots than unplanted plots in 1999, while both 3- and 6-species plots were greater than unplanted plots in 2000; however, there were no differences at 5-20 cm depth and no species-specific effects. Root and shoot biomass both increased with species richness, with total biomass of 6-species, plots averaging 995.6 +/- 120.5 g/m(2) in 2000, compared to the mean for 1-species plots (572.1 +/- 90.3 g/m(2)) and unplanted plots (164.5 +/- 24.7 g/m(2)). Still, at the age of three years, root biomass was only about one-third that of the species-rich reference site, and shoot biomass was one-half to one-fifth the maxima reported for reference salt marshes. Species-specific effects were found for Sv, which had high biomass of both roots and shoots in the multispecies plots (55% of aboveground biomass in 3-species plots and 41% in 6-species plots) and the highest pool of N (52% of the N pool in 3-species plots and 42% in 6-species plots), even though only one-eighth of the initial plantings were Sv. However, when plots with this species were excluded from the analysis, the species-richness effect persisted. Thus, ecosystem function, as measured by biomass. and N accumulation, increased with species richness regardless of dominance by the highly productive,Sv. We conclude that manipulating the richness and composition of plantings offers ecosystem restorationists an effective tool-for accelerating the rate of functional development.

AB  - Estimating carbon sequestration and nutrient accumulation rates are important to understanding wetland's roles on regional or global carbon cycles. The objectives of this study were to estimate accretion rates of carbon and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) by Cs-137 dating technology in typical meadows (Deyeuxia angustifolia wetland) and marshes (Carex lasiocarpa wetland) in Sanjiang Plain, and to reveal the potential factors influencing carbon sequestrations in wetland. Results indicated that soil accretion rates were 4.26 mm yr(-1) in C. lasiocarpa wetland and 2.55 mm yr(-1) in D. angustifolia wetland, respectively. Consequently, carbon sequestration, N and P accumulation rates were 95.95 +/- 22.76 g C yr(-1) 8.23 +/- 2.30 g N yr(-1) m(-2), and 2.04 +/- 0.90 g P yr(-1) m(-2) inD. angustifolia wetland while these rates were 149.47 +/- 39.54 g C yr(-1) m(-2), 13.17 +/- 3.45 g N yr(-1) m(-2) and 1.96 +/- 0.20 g P yr(-1) m(-2) inC. lasiocarpa wetland, respectively. Carbon sequestration and N accumulation rates were higher in marsh than in meadow while P appeared in contradiction. High carbon and nutrient accumulation rates might due to large plant biomass variations and persistent surface water in marsh.. Correlation analysis showed a high significant positive correlation between carbon sequestration rates and ratios of N to P in soil, implying that its comparative low P contents in marsh soils might contribute to high carbon sequestration rates. It is estimated that carbon sequestration potential abilities had decreased by 2.46x10(6)similar to 3.84x10(6) t C per year in 2005 because of the large wetland areas loss.

AB  - Surface son and sediment samples collected along a forest-brackfish marsh-salt marsh transect in a southeastern U.S. estuary were separated into three different fractions (sand, macro-organic matter, and humus) based on size and density Elemental, stable carbon isotope, and lignin analyses of these samples reveal important contrasts in the quantity, composition, and sources of organic matter between Forest and marsh sites. Elevated nitrogen contents in humus samples suggest nitrogen incorporation during humification is most extensive in forest soils relative to the marsh sites. The lignin compositions of the macro-organic and humus samples reflect the predominant type of vegetation at each site. Lignin phenol ratios indicate that woody and nonwoody litter from gymnosperm and angiosperms trees (pines and oaks) is the major source of vascular plant-derived organic matter in the forest site and that angiosperm grasses (Juncus and Spartina) are the major sources of lignin at the marsh sites. The phenol distributions also reveal that oxidative degradation of Lignin is most extensive in the forest and brackish marsh zones whereas little Lignin decay occurs in the salt marsh samples. In forest soils, most organic matter originates From highly altered forest vegetation while at the brackish marsh site organic matter is a mixture of degraded Juncus materials and microbial/algal remains. Organic matter in the salt marsh appears to be composed of a more complex mixture of sources, including degraded Spartina detritus as well as algal and microbial inputs. Microbial methane oxidation appears to be an important process and a source of C-15 depleted organic carbon in subsurface sediments at this site.

AB  - The introduction of portable in situ ultraviolet-visual spectrometers has made possible the collection of water quality parameters at a high frequency in dynamic systems such as tidal marshes. The usefulness of this technology is inhibited by fouling of the instrument's optics. In this study, a spectrometer fitted with manufacturer-recommended compressed air optical cleaning was installed in a brackish marsh to determine if fouling interfered with measurements between biweekly servicing. During a 2-wk period, the absorbance measured in air at 220 nm increased from 9 to 549 m(-1), indicating major fouling. An antifouling system was developed that reduced the time of exposure of the optics to stream water and used a pressurized fresh water cleaning. After implementation of the system, the absorbance in air increased to at most 63 m(-1) after 2 wk of data collection. The dramatic reduction in fouling will allow quality long-term data to be collected using this technology.

AB  - Ponds are unvegetated rounded depressions commonly present on marsh platforms. The role of ponds on the long-term morphological evolution of tidal marshes is unclearat times ponds expand but eventually recover the marsh platform, at other times ponds never recover and lead to permanent marsh loss. Existing field observations indicate that episodic disturbances of the marsh vegetation cause the formation of small (1-10m) isolated ponds, even if the vegetated platform keeps pace with relative sea level rise (RSLR) and that isolated ponds tend to deepen and enlarge until they eventually connect to the channel network. Here I implement a simple model to study the vertical and planform evolution of a single connected pond. A newly connected pond recovers if its bed lies above the limit for marsh plant growth or if the inorganic deposition rate is larger than the RSLR rate. A pond that cannot accrete faster than RSLR will deepen and enlarge, eventually entering a runaway erosion by wave edge retreat. A large tidal range, a large sediment supply, and a low rate of RSLR favor pond recovery. The model suggests that inorganic sediment deposition alone controls pond recovery, even in marshes where organic matter dominates accretion of the vegetated platform. As such, halting permanent marsh loss by pond collapse requires to increase inorganic sediment deposition. Because pond collapse is possible even if the vegetated platform keeps pace with RSLR, I conclude that marsh resilience to RSLR is less than previously quantified.

AB  - The cycling of organic matter through food webs is a fundamental process that may be altered by the invasion of non-indigenous plants. We explored consequences of the invasion of non-indigenous Spartina patens to the composition of soil organic matter (SOM) and to detritivore and herbivore diets in the upper salt marsh within Corrubedo National Park, northwest Spain. We tested for the incorporation of S. patens carbon (C) into SOM and by detritivores and herbivores using stable isotope analysis, focusing primarily on detritivorous enchytraeid oligochaetes and herbivorous insects. Stable isotope results indicated that C derived from S. patens has been incorporated into SOM. Elevated densities of enchytraeids in stands of S. patens, and their incorporation of C derived from this plant, suggested that dense patches of S. patens may facilitate detritivore populations. In contrast, although insect herbivores used S. patens as habitat, there was little isotopic evidence for the widespread incorporation of S. patens-derived C by these consumers. The population and dietary response of enchytraeids to S. patens suggests that S. patens invasion could indirectly influence soil processes and pathways mediated by detritivore activity (e. g., soil respiration rates, nutrient retention and transformation, energy flow). The loss of food resources to insect herbivores alters local food webs. However, insect herbivores may move and feed on native plants elsewhere. As a result, insect populations may be less immediately impacted than soil detritivore populations by S. patens. Our study suggests that the influences of S. patens invasion extend beyond the more obvious changes in native plant abundance, to include differing responses in the cycling of organic matter between detritivore and insect herbivore food web pathways.

AB  - Suaeda salsa community is a vegetation type in saline-alkali areas. Weed invasion and colonization in S. salsa communities lead to fragmentationsof S. salsa communities. The colonization of invaded weeds in S. salsa communities is related to community succession of saline-alkali zones. The fragmented S. salsa community may be restored if the mechanism of invaded weed colonization in S. salsa communities is clearly elucidated. Thus, we studied the ecological stoichiometric characteristics of soils and plants in a salt marsh to explain the high colonization possibility of invaded weeds in S. salsa communities. In October 2014, soils and plants were collected from Dongfeng Salt Marsh, Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, China. The ratio of Ex-N/Ex-P in soil was less than 13, which suggests a relative nitrogen limitation for the primary production in the zone. The minimum phosphorus content in plants was higher than 1 mg g(-1), whereas the maximum nitrogen content in plants was less than 13 mg g(-1). These results imply that phosphorus was abundant, whereas nitrogen was deficient in the area. The plants in the salt marsh may be limited by nitrogen. Given the relatively lower nitrogen contents in Cyperus glomeratus, Echinochloa crusgalli, and Aster subulatus than that in S. salsa, these three species exhibited higher competitiveness than S. salsa did when nitrogen was limited in primary production. These weed species may colonize highly in S. salsa communities. Moreover, nitrogen fertilization might be effective to maintain S. salsa community in Dongfeng Salt Marsh, whereas its effects on controlling weeds colonization in S. salsa communities need more studies to verify.

AB  - A soil with a high organic content, a calcaric phaeozem, has been imaged in a hydrated state using the Stony Brook scanning transmission X-ray microscope at the NSLS, Brookhaven, USA. This experiment has been performed at the carbon K absorption edge to determine the distribution of organic matter within this soil. Spectromicroscopic methods using the known spectra of humics are helping to distinguish between different kinds of carbon in the sample. In addition, a marsh soil from Northern Germany has been analyzed at the sulfur K-absorption edge with the scanning X-ray microscope at the ESRF (ID 21), Grenoble, France. This soil contains a variety of sulfur containing components, which are attached to the soil colloids. A major source of these components is the microbial activity. In this soil it is possible to identify spectroscopically amino acids like methionin and cysteine and proteins, which are built up from those molecules, and inorganic components like sulfates and sulfides.

AB  - The magnitude, spatial patterns, and controlling factors of the carbon and water fluxes of terrestrial ecosystems in China are not well understood due to the lack of ecosystem-level flux observations. We synthesized flux and micrometeorological observations from 22 eddy covariance flux sites across China, and examined the carbon fluxes, evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) of terrestrial ecosystems at the annual scale. Our results show that annual carbon and water fluxes exhibited clear latitudinal patterns across sites. Both annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) declined with increasing latitude, leading to a declining pattern in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) with increasing latitude. Annual ET also generally declined with increasing latitude. The spatial patterns of annual carbon and water fluxes were mainly driven by annual temperature, precipitation, and growing season length. Carbon fluxes, ET, and water use efficiency (WUE) varied with vegetation type. Overall, forest and cropland sites had higher annual fluxes than grassland sites, and the annual fluxes of coastal wetland sites were similar to or slightly higher than those of forest sites. Annual WUE was associated with annual precipitation, GPP, and growing season length. Higher-productivity ecosystems (forests and coastal wetlands) also had higher WUE than lower-productivity ecosystems (grasslands and croplands). The strong relationships between annual GPP and ET demonstrated the coupling of the carbon and water cycles. Our results show that forest plantations had high annual NEP and WUE, and could provide larger carbon sequestration capacity than natural forests. The coastal salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems also had high carbon sequestration capacity. Efforts to strengthen China's terrestrial carbon sink should focus on ecosystems such as forest plantations in southern China where heat and water are ideal for maintaining high productivity. This strategy is especially important because efforts to increase carbon sequestration in areas of limited water may inadvertently contribute to the ongoing water crisis in northern China.

AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of the fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) and associated abiotic sediment parameters were quantified for the first time across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary during 2009/2010. During all times of day and the seasons measured, N2O and CH4 fluxes from coastal marsh ranged from -0.0147 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1) to 0.0982 mgN(2.) O m(-2) h(-1) and -0.7421 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) to 0.4242 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The mean N2O fluxes in spring, summer, autumn and winter were 0.0325 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), 0.0089 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), 0.0119 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1) and 0.0140 mgN(2)O m(-2) h(-1), and the average CH4 fluxes were -0.0109 mgCH(4-) m(-2) h(-1), -0.0174 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), -0.0141 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1) and -0.0089 mgCH(4) m(-2) h(-1), respectively, indicating that the coastal marsh acted as N2O source and CH4 sink. Both N2O and CH4 fluxes differed significantly between times of day of sampling. N2O fluxes differed significantly between sampling seasons as well as between sampling positions, while CH4 fluxes had no significant differences between seasons or positions. Temporal variations of N2O emissions were probably related to the effects of vegetation (S. salsa) during summer and autumn and the frequent freeze/thaw cycle of sediment during spring and winter, while those of CH4 fluxes were controlled by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors (soil moisture and salinity). Spatial variations of N2O and CM., fluxes were primarily affected by soil moisture fluctuation derived from astronomic tide, sediment substrate and vegetation composition. N2O and CH4 fluxes, expressed as CO2-equivaltent (CO2-e) emissions, showed that N2O comprised the principal part of total calculated CO2-e emissions during spring and winter, while the contributions of CH4 could not be ignored during summer and autumn. This study highlights the importance of seasonal N2O and CH4 contributions, particularly during times of significant CH4 consumption. For the accurate up-scaling of N2O and CH4 fluxes to annual rates, a careful sampling design at site-level is required to capture the potentially considerable temporal and spatial variations of N2O and CH4 emissions.

AB  - Thirty-four vegetation clusters identified in the present study, after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA multivariate techniques, were assigned into 8 vegetation types, each of definite vegetation and habitat characters.  The suggested vegetation types are well segregated along the DCA axis one which reflects soil moisture, salinity (as indicated by EC values), fertility (as indicated by the organic matter and nitrogen contents) and species diversity gradients.  In general, soil moisture and soil fertility increase and species diversity decreases with the following sequence of vegetation types:  Echinops spinosissimus-Ononis serrata on inland sand dunes, Pancratium maritimum on coastal sand dunes, Halocnemum strobilaceum-Salsola kali in saline sand deposits, Atriplex halimus-Chenopodium murale along the terraces and slopes of drains, Arthrocnemum glaucum-Tamarix nilotica in salt marshes, Chenopodium murale along the slopes of drains, Phragmites australis along the littoral zones of drains, and Lemna gibba-Potamogeton crispus in the water zone.  This sequence reflects also a gradient of human interference, starting with the vegetation of the less disturbed habitats (sand dunes and saline sand deposits) and ending with the fully man-made habitats (drain zones).

AB  - Salinity alterations will likely change the plant and environmental characteristics in coastal marshes thereby influencing soil carbon accumulation rates. Coastal Louisiana marshes have been historically classified as fresh, intermediate, brackish, or saline based on resident plant community and position along a salinity gradient. Short-term total carbon accumulation rates were assessed by collecting 10-cm deep soil cores at 24 sites located in marshes spanning the salinity gradient. Bulk density, total carbon content, and the short-term accretion rates obtained with feldspar horizon markers were measured to determine total carbon accumulation rates. Despite some significant differences in soil properties among marsh types, the mean total carbon accumulation rates among marsh types were not significantly different (mean +/- std. err. of 190 +/- 27 g TC m(-2) year(-1)). However, regression analysis indicated that mean annual surface salinity had a significant negative relationship with total carbon accumulation rates. Based on both analyses, the coastal Louisiana total marsh area (1,433,700 ha) accumulates about 2.7 to 3.3 Tg C year(-1). Changing salinities due to increasing relative sea level or resulting from restoration activities may alter carbon accumulation rates in the short term and significantly influence the global carbon cycle.

AB  - This study documented surface distributions of live and dead foraminiferal assemblages in the low-gradient tidal marshes of the barrier island and estuarine complex of the eastern Mississippi Sound (Grand Bay, Pascagoula River, Fowl River, Dauphin Island). A total of 71,833 specimens representing 38 species were identified from a gradient of different elevation zones across the study area. We identified five live assemblages and nine biofacies for the dead assemblages from estuarine, low marsh, middle marsh, high marsh, and upland transition environments. Although dissolution of calcareous tests was observed in the dead assemblages, characteristic species and abundance patterns dependent on elevation in the intertidal zone were similar between living assemblages and dead biofacies. The assemblages from the eastern Mississippi Sound estuaries were dominated by Ammonia tepida, Cribroelphidium poeyanum, C. excavatum, and Paratrochammina simplissima. The low marshes were dominated by Ammotium salsum, Ammobaculites exiguus, and Miliammina fusca. The dominant species in the middle marshes was Arenoparrella mexicana. The most abundant species in the high marshes was Entzia macrescens. The upland-marsh transition zones were dominated by Trochamminita irregularis and Pseudothurammina limnetis. Canonical correspondence analysis was applied to assess the relationship between a priori defined biofacies and measured environmental data (elevation, grain size, organic matter, and salinity) to test the hypothesis that distribution of foraminiferal assemblages is driven by elevation and hence flooding frequency. Salinity was the second most important explanatory variable of dead assemblages. Riverine freshwater from the Pascagoula River markedly influenced the live and dead assemblages in the Pascagoula River marsh, which was represented by low diversity and densities and dominance by Ammoastuta inepta. The relationship between the measured environmental variables and assemblage distributions can be used in future Mississippi Sound paleo-environmental studies.

AB  - Globally, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions have been seriously augmented due to the devastating effects of anthropogenic pressures on coastal ecosystems including mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The greening of aquaculture, however, including an ecosystem approach to Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) and Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) could play a significant role in reversing this trend, enhancing coastal ecosystems, and sequestering blue carbon. Ponds within IAA farming systems sequester more carbon per unit area than conventional fish ponds, natural lakes, and inland seas. The translocation of shrimp culture from mangrove swamps to offshore IMTA could reduce mangrove loss, reverse blue carbon emissions, and in turn increase storage of blue carbon through restoration of mangroves. Moreover, offshore IMTA may create a barrier to trawl fishing which in turn could help restore seagrasses and further enhance blue carbon sequestration. Seaweed and shellfish culture within IMTA could also help to sequester more blue carbon. The greening of aquaculture could face several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize substantial benefits from enhanced blue carbon sequestration and eventually contribute to global climate change mitigation.

AB  - Tidal marsh creation helps remediate global warming because tidal wetlands are especially proficient at sequestering carbon (C) in soils. However, greenhouse gas (GHG) losses can offset the climatic benefits gained from C storage depending on how these tidal marshes are constructed and managed. This study attempts to determine the GHG emissions from a 4-6 year old created brackish marsh, what environmental factors governed these emissions, and how the magnitude of the fluxes relates to other wetland ecosystems. The static flux chamber method was used to measure GHG fluxes across three distinct plant zones segregated by elevation. The major of soil GHG fluxes from the marsh were from CO2 (-48-192 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), although it was near the lower end of values reported from other wetland types having lower salinities, and would mostly be offset by photosynthetic uptake in this created brackish marsh. Methane flux was also low (-0.33-0.86 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), likely inhibited by the high soil SO4 (2-) and soil redox potentials poised above -150 mV in this in this created brackish marsh environment. Low N2O flux (-0.11-0.10 mg N m(-2) h(-1)) was due to low soil NO3 (-) and soil redox conditions favoring complete denitrification. GHG fluxes from this created brackish marsh were generally lower than those recorded from natural marshes, suggesting that C sequestration may not be offset by the radiative forcing from soil GHG emissions if projects are designed properly.

AB  - Recent coastal storms and associated recovery efforts have led to increased investment in nature-based coastal protection, including restoration of salt marshes and construction of living shorelines. In particular, many of these efforts focus on increasing vertical elevation through sediment nourishment, where sediment is removed from the tidal channel and placed on the marsh plain, or preventing lateral erosion through shoreline protection. In the USA alone, millions of dollars have been allocated or spent on these coastal protection solutions over the last few decades because of their perceived sustainability and ecologically positive co-benefits including habitat provision and carbon sequestration. These projects would benefit from integration of sediment transport pathways, budgets, and metrics during planning and modeling of restoration outcomes, in order to evaluate sustainability before investment. This is analogous to the decades of experience with coastal management and engineering on the open coast. Salt marshes are geomorphic features that rely partially on external sediment supply to maintain their network of tidal channels, intertidal flats, and marsh plain. Removing sediment from one component of the overall system to nourish another component may be counterproductive, given that the net sediment budget is unchanged. For example, dredging a tidal channel beyond its equilibrium condition will cause it to fill with sediment from the tidal flat or elsewhere in the system. This may cause slumping of the marsh edge, or over-deepening of other sections of the channel to compensate. Similarly, shoreline protection that prevents edge erosion hampers the marsh plain's ability to accrete on the levee and naturally transgress landward or it starves other components of the system of regularly supplied sediment. A limited vertical or lateral-only perspective, instead of a three-dimensional perspective, during project planning and evaluation may lead to suboptimal decision-making regarding restoration priorities, approaches, and outcomes. I contend that before significant investments are made in marsh restoration through sediment nourishment or shoreline protection, sediment transport measurements and models that consider sediment dynamics should be integrated into the early phases of restoration planning. This will help identify where and under what conditions marsh restoration will most likely be successful and economically justified. Triaging and prioritizing is then possible, which is a sustainable approach for restoration, given the persistent vulnerability of marshes to sea-level rise, storms, and sediment deficits.

AB  - Field studies were conducted in North Carolina to determine the responses of mosquitoes found in salt marsh and inland creek flood plain areas to 1-octen-3-ol (octenol), carbon dioxide (CO2), and light in various combinations with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps. Over 56,000 adult mosquito specimens of 12 species in 4 genera were collected in the salt marsh. They exhibited a general response pattern of octenol + CO2 + light > CO2 + light = octenol + CO2 > octenol + light > octenol alone. Significantly, more Aedes sollicitans, Ae. taeniorhynchus, Anopheles bradleyi, and Culex salinarius were attracted to octenol + CO2 + light than to CO2 + light. Over 19,000 specimens of 24 species in 7 genera were collected in the inland creek flood plain. Although the response patterns to the attractants were similar to those in the salt marsh area, there was no significant difference between octenol + CO2 + light and CO2 + light. Aedes vexans, An. crucians, and An. punctipennis were attracted nearly equally to these two attractant combinations. These studies demonstrate that responses to combinations of these attractants are species specific. However, different combinations of attractants can significantly increase the collection of targeted species important in arbovirus transmission. The use of these combinations would be very beneficial in mosquito-borne virus surveillance studies. The use of octenol by itself or in conjunction with light was found the least useful for collecting mosquitoes in both habitats.

AB  - We measured the effects of a plant invasion (Phragmites australis) on resident fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in New England salt marshes by assessing diet quality at the food web base and by quantifying the importance of primary producers to secondary production using a recently developed Bayesian mixing model (Stable Isotope Analysis in R, "SIAR"). Spartina alterniflora, the dominant native plant, exhibited significantly greater leaf toughness and higher C/N ratios relative to P. australis. Benthic microalgae and phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) exhibited the lowest C/N indicating higher diet quality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in SIAR by modeling F. heteroclitus at three separate trophic levels (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) using species-specific discrimination factors to determine basal resource contributions. Overall, the best-fitting models include those that assume F. heteroclitus resides approximately 2.0 trophic levels above primary producers. Using discrimination factors from a range of data sources reported in the literature, our analyses revealed that consumers rely less on benthic microalgae and phytoplankton in restricted marshes (7-23 % and 11-44 %, respectively) relative to reference marshes (5-34 % and 23-48 %, respectively), resulting in a shift in diet toward invasive plant consumption (0-27 %). This is likely due to increased P. australis cover and marsh surface shading leading to decreased microalgal biomass, combined with reduced flooding of the marsh surface that favors terrestrial invertebrate assemblages. Restoration decreased the quantity of P. australis in the food web (0-15 %) and increased the importance of microalgae (1-30 %), phytoplankton (19-48 %), and native plants (23-63 %), indicating a shift in ecological recovery toward reference conditions.

AB  - Tidal coasts are characterized by natural disturbances, forming a broad variety of habitats, which provide different niches and varying food resources for benthic foraminifera. Foraminifera occupy different trophic levels and fill key trophic positions in benthic food webs, but detailed studies on their nutrition spectrum in inter- to supratidal environments are lacking. Further, it is unknown to what extent foraminifera can switch between different feeding modes depending on resource availability in different Wadden Sea habitats. In order to shed light on these questions, we investigated potential food resources in sediments as well as the food spectrum of two dominant benthic foraminifera, Trochammina inflate and Ammonia tepida, in four characteristic habitats of the Wadden Sea: salt marsh, mixed flat, oyster reef and mud flat, using fatty acid (FA) analysis. The sediments of the four habitats provide a broad range of food sources including green algae, brown algae, diatoms and bacteria for benthic foraminifera. The FA profile of T inflate from the salt marsh and mixed flat was dominated by green algae and bacteria, whereas the brown algae biomarker was only found in specimens from the salt marsh. In comparison, FA profiles of A. tepida suggested dominant algae feeding (green algae and diatoms), whereas brown algae and bacterial FAs were only found in specimens from the oyster reef. The results suggest that foraminifera mainly feed at low trophic levels with selective food intake closely depending on their habitat. The diverse nutritional strategies may allow efficient exploitation of resources in dynamic tidal habitats. Presumably, foraminifera serve as an important link between lower and higher trophic levels and thus fill key trophic positions in the benthic food web of the Wadden Sea.

AB  - The natural abundance of radiocarbon (C-14) provides unique insight into the source and cycling of sedimentary organic matter. Radiocarbon analysis of bacterial phospholipid lipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in salt-marsh sediments of southeast Georgia (USA)-one heavily contaminated by petroleum residues-was used to assess the fate of petroleum-derived carbon in sediments and incorporation of fossil carbon into microbial biomass. PLFAs that are common components of eubacterial cell membranes (e.g., branched C-15 and C-17, 10-methyl-C-16) were depleted in C-14 in the contaminated sediment (mean Delta C-14 value of +25 +/- 19 parts per thousand for bacterial PLFAs) relative to PLFAs in uncontaminated "control" sediment (Delta C-14 = +101 +/- 12 parts per thousand). We suggest that the C-14-depletion in bacterial PLFAs at the contaminated site results from microbial metabolism of petroleum and subsequent incorporation of petroleum-derived carbon into bacterial membrane lipids. A mass balance calculation indicates that 6-10% of the carbon in bacterial PLFAs at the oiled site could derive from petroleum residues. These results demonstrate that even weathered petroleum may contain components of sufficient lability to be a carbon source for biomass production by marsh sediment microorganisms. Furthermore, a small but significant fraction of fossil carbon is assimilated even in the presence of a much larger pool of presumably more-labile and faster-cycling carbon substrates.

AB  - Coastal marshes are essential habitats for soil carbon accumulation and burial, which can influence the global carbon budget. Coastal Louisiana has extensive marsh habitats (fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline) where soil cores were collected to a depth of 100 cm at 24 sites to assess long-term carbon accumulation and burial rates. Select soil depth intervals were analyzed for bulk density, total carbon, and radionuclide (Cs-137 and Pb-210) dating. Marsh habitat maps (years 1949-2013) were also used to determine the most frequently occurring habitat at each field site. Over 5 decades, half of the sites transitioned between marsh habitats at least once. Saline marshes tended to have lower mean total carbon density (0.04 +/- 0.002 g cm(-3)) and lower mean long-term total carbon accumulation rates (211 +/- 46 g TC m(-2) yr(-1), n = 5, based on Pb-210) compared to the other marsh habitats. Using marsh habitat specific accumulation rates and area, the total carbon burial rate for coastal Louisiana in year 2013 was estimated at 4.3 Tg TC yr(-1) which accounts for about 5%-21% of the estimated tidal wetland burial rate globally. Historically, about 1.0 Tg TC yr(-1) was lost due to reduced marsh area from 1949 to 2013. With no coastal restoration activity, the predicted wetland loss over the next 50 years could reduce carbon burial in coastal Louisiana to 2.1 Tg TC yr(-1), a reduction of about 50% from the year 2013 rate, with potential to significantly alter the global carbon budget.

AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon accumulation capacity of vegetated coastal habitats, including salt marshes, mangroves forests and seagrass meadows. Here we present estimates of organic carbon (C-org) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) burial rates from 4 seagrass species (Halophila ovalis, Posidonia australis, Ruppia megacarpa, Zostera muelleri) in 3 temperate estuaries on the east coast of Australia. The C-org burial rates (mean +/- SE) varied by an order of magnitude across the seagrass communities (16 +/- 3 to 130 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1)). The delta C-13(org) and C-org:N ratios suggest that the seagrass communities buried variable mixtures of seagrass, algal and mangrove/terrestrial material. CaCO3 burial rates ranged from 15 +/- 11 to 188 +/- 122 g m(-2) yr(-1), which, if precipitated by calcifying organisms in these or nearby habitats, may offset up to 89% of the C-org burial across the 8 seagrass communities. Our results highlight a large range in both C-org and CaCO3 burial rates, and the provenance of the carbon sequestered in seagrasses, factors that need to be considered when assessing the role of seagrasses in blue carbon and climate change mitigation strategies.

AB  - The replacement of native species by invasive Phragmites australis in coastal wetlands may impact ecosystem processes including fluxes of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To investigate differences in daytime CH4 and CO2 fluxes as well as vegetation properties between Phragmites and native vegetation zones along a salinity gradient, fluxes were measured via cavity ringdown spectroscopy in 3 New England coastal marshes, ranging from oligohaline to polyhaline. While daytime CH4 emissions decreased predictably with increasing soil salinity, those from Phragmites zones were larger (15 to 1254 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) than those from native vegetation (4-484 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) across the salinity gradient. Phragmites zones displayed greater daytime CO2 uptake than native vegetation zones (-7 to -15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) vs. -2 to 0.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) at mesohaline-polyhaline, but not oligohaline, sites. Results suggest that vegetation zone and salinity both impact net emission or uptake of daytime CO2 and CH4 (respectively). Future research is warranted to demonstrate Phragmites-mediated impacts on GHG fluxes, and additional measurements across seasonal and diel cycles will enable a more complete understanding of Phragmites' net impact on marsh radiative forcing.

AB  - Accelerated sea-level rise poses a significant threat to coastal habitats, such as salt marshes, which provide critical ecosystem services. Persistence of salt marshes with rising sea levels relies, in part, on vertical accretion. Ecogeomorphic models emphasize the role of plant production in vertical accretion via sediment trapping and belowground organic matter contribution. Thus, changes in plant production can influence saltmarsh persistence with sea-level rise. However, models of marsh accretion do not consider animal-mediated changes in plant production. We tested how 2 marsh crabs, Minuca pugnax and Sesarma reticulatum, which have contrasting effects (facilitation vs. herbivory) on Spartina alterniflora production, may indirectly influence sediment deposition and belowground production, through observational surveys and field manipulation. Minuca facilitated Spartina biomass in some marshes, but not sediment deposition, and had no effect on belowground organic matter contribution, suggesting that in isolation, Minuca has little indirect impact on saltmarsh geomorphic processes. Sesarma reduced Spartina biomass; however, sediment deposition increased, contrary to ecogeomorphic models, likely due to sediment resuspension by Minuca. When Minuca and Sesarma co-occur, the effect on Spartina production and sediment deposition depended on the amount of grazing. When Sesarma grazing is low, Minuca facilitates Spartina growth and mitigates the effect of grazing. However, when Sesarma grazing is high and vegetation is removed, Minuca can resuspend sediment through bioturbation, suggesting the net effect of these species may depend on their relative abundance. This study demonstrates that the effects of plant-animal interactions on marsh resilience against sealevel rise are context dependent.

AB  - Wetlands are known to be important sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to rivers and coastal environments. However, the environmental dynamics of DOM within wetlands have not been well documented on large spatial scales. To better assess DOM dynamics within large wetlands, we determined high resolution spatial distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) in a subtropical freshwater wetland, the Everglades, Florida, USA. DOC concentrations decreased from north to south along the general water flow path and were linearly correlated with chloride concentration, a tracer of water derived from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), suggesting that agricultural activities are directly or indirectly a major source of DOM in the Everglades. The optical properties of DOM, however, also changed successively along the water flow path from high molecular weight, peat-soil and highly oxidized agricultural soil-derived DOM to the north, to lower molecular weight, biologically produced DOM to the south. These results suggest that even though DOC concentration seems to be distributed conservatively, DOM sources and diagenetic processing can be dynamic throughout wetland landscapes. As such, EEM-PARAFAC clearly revealed that humic-enriched DOM from the EAA is gradually replaced by microbial- and plant-derived DOM along the general water flow path, while additional humic-like contributions are added from marsh soils. Results presented here indicate that both hydrology and primary productivity are important drivers controlling DOM dynamics in large wetlands. The biogeochemical processes controlling the DOM composition are complex and merit further investigation.

AB  - Coastal habitats are important and imperiled. To mitigate climate change impacts, carbon (C) sequestration has joined established restoration objectives, including habitat diversity, public access, and native vegetation. Changing topography, maintaining trails, and removing invasive plants may influence coastal C production and retention in different ways depending on how each activity influences the stabilization of organic matter in surface sediments. We quantified variation in litter and surface soil dynamics within and between coastal parks that varied in age from prerestoration to nearly 20 years old in Manatee County, Florida. Older parks had deeper soil organic horizons with higher levels of soil moisture and respiration, indicating that restoration sequesters soil C despite increases in microbial efficiency. However, variation within parks indicated that detrital C dynamics change depending on local management objectives. Relative to unmanaged locations, restored wetlands, including mangroves, salt marshes, and freshwater ponds, had soil organic horizons nearly 20 cm deeper, with high litter stabilization rates despite less litter mass and shorter projected soil sample C mineralization. In contrast, public access features like trails and kayak launches were associated with increased surface CO2 efflux and marginally reduced soil organic horizon depth. Removing invasives had little impact on detrital carbon pools and fluxes. Incorporating detrital C dynamics improved a multivariate model for variation in C pool sizes across sites. Overall, our results suggest that management objectives influence the C production and retention capacity of restored coastal habitats with restored uplands and public access points storing less C than relatively inaccessible wetlands.

AB  - Bacteria influence carbon cycling in coastal sediments by decomposing the organic matter produced in situ as well as that delivered from the landscape and neighboring ecosystems. Disturbances, such as eutrophication, and seasonal swings in primary production may influence sediment organic matter composition and, as a result, the sources of carbon available to bacteria. We evaluated whether bacterial carbon sources varied between 2 salt marsh tidal creeks with different water column nutrient levels (fertilized versus ambient) and if they changed over a growing season through field observations and stable isotope labeling experiments. Sediment organic matter composition, determined using lipid biomarkers and stable isotopes, was similar between the tidal creeks and did not change over time. In the field, isotopic analysis (natural abundance delta C-13) of bacterial lipids and potential organic matter sources revealed that bacteria assimilated carbon from several sources but mainly relied on microalgae. In the experiments, C-13 was added to sediment cores from both creeks as sodium bicarbonate (June, August, October) or Spartina alterniflora detritus (August) and traced into lipids representing benthic microalgae (BMA) and bacteria. Bacteria assimilated C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora at similar rates. Further, C-13 from S. alterniflora was rapidly transferred to BMA, likely via bacterial respiration. Overall, nutrient enrichment did not affect bacterial carbon sources in the field or incorporation of C-13 from BMA and S. alterniflora in the experiments. Tight coupling between BMA and bacteria may explain why nitrogen enrichment effects were limited as well as provide a mechanism for retaining newly fixed and detrital carbon in coastal sediments.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and storage in mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows is an essential coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystem service for climate change mitigation. Here we offer a comprehensive, global and spatially explicit economic assessment of carbon sequestration and storage in three coastal ecosystem types at the global and national levels. We propose a new approach based on the country-specific social cost of carbon that allows us to calculate each country's contribution to, and redistribution of, global blue carbon wealth. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute a mean +/- s.e.m. of US$190.67 +/- 30 bn yr(-1) to blue carbon wealth. The three countries generating the largest positive net blue wealth contribution for other countries are Australia, Indonesia and Cuba, with Australia alone generating a positive net benefit of US$22.8 +/- 3.8 bn yr(-)(1) for the rest of the world through coastal ecosystem carbon sequestration and storage in its territory.
   Blue carbon ecosystems take up and store substantial amounts of carbon. This represents an important ecosystem service in the context of climate change, with coastal ecosystems contributing nearly US$200 bn yr(-)(1) to blue carbon wealth.

AB  - The community structure of a benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage in a contaminated salt marsh was evaluated as part of an ecological characterization of a former chloralkali production facility in Georgia. Sample locations were chosen based on a gradient of the primary contaminants of concern, total mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), primarily Aroclor 1268. Sediment concentrations of Aroclor 1268 ranged from 2.3 to 150 mg/kg dry weight, while mercury concentrations ranged from 15 to 170 mg/kg dry weight in the study area. Mercury and PCBs were determined to be co-located in the sediments. Total organic carbon composition of the sediments was negatively associated with PCB and mercury concentrations. A total of 29 benthic taxa was identified in 49 samples; replicate samples were taken at each of five sampling locations. Mean infaunal density across all sampling locations was estimated at approximately 61,000 to 234,000 organisms m(-2) Overall, polychaetes comprised 57% of the infaunal community with Manayunkia aestuarina as the dominant species. Oligochaetes, nematodes, crustacea, insects, and gastropods comprised 23.0, 18.0, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.2% of the overall benthic community, respectively Density estimates of individual species between sampling locations showed no consistent patterns in response to pollutants. However, an analysis of higher taxonomic levels revealed some general trends. In uncontaminated areas, the benthic community was dominated by nematodes and oligochaetes, whereas moderate to highly contaminated areas were dominated by polychaetes and a smaller percentage of oligochaetes and nematodes. A trophic analysis of the same data set revealed that the community shifted from an evenly distributed percentage of surface and subsurface feeders in the uncontaminated areas to a community dominated by surface feeders in the more contaminated locations. Carnivores comprised from 0.13 to 0.90% of the trophic structure, with the percentage of carnivores generally decreasing with increasing contamination. Mercury and PCBs were bioaccumulating in representative marsh benthic invertebrates, presenting a potential source of contaminants to marsh consumers. Tissue PCB and tissue mercury concentrations were positively related to sediment PCB and mercury concentrations, respectively. A standard 14-day toxicity test using the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus showed no acute toxicity across the sampling locations.

AB  - Shoot density, standing crop (above- and below-ground biomass) and habitat of salt marsh grass Porteresia coarctata were investigated along the coast of Bakkhali estuary, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh from January to December 2006. Shoot density of P. coarctata was influenced by season and was found to be higher (> 2 500 shoots/m(2)) in post-monsoon and minimal in monsoon season; plants were particularly active in vegetative propagation during pre-monsoon. Above-ground biomass was greater along the protected coast compared with the exposed one in this estuary. Below-ground biomass was higher (7.75-269.53 g DW/m(2)) than that above ground (2.20-114.75 g DW/m(2)). Standing crops of P. coarctata showed a negative relationship (R =-0.77; P < 0.05) with sedimentation rate, while seasonal activity influenced sedimentation. The recorded sedimentation rate was lower (6.09 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in pre-monsoon and highest (14.55 mg/(cm(2)center dot d)) in monsoon season. The mean value of pore water salinity was higher (34.25 +/- 5.05) during post-monsoon and lowest (18.0 +/- 3.71) in monsoon season. The soil was sandy clay in this P. coarctata bed; it consisted of 86% sand, 13% clay and 1% silt. Soil organic matter dropped during the monsoon season (0.78%-0.67%) and was highest ((2.17 +/- 1.42)%-(2.3 +/- 1.47)%) during post-monsoon, probably owing to accumulation of decomposed peat on the marsh surface. The mean pore water NH4-N concentration ranged from 2.44 +/- 1.65 to 3.33 +/- 1.82 mu g/L, with a minimum air temperature of 22.09A degrees C in post-monsoon and a maximum of 31.16A degrees C in pre-monsoon. Variations of physico-chemical parameters in the soil, water, and climate governed biological parameters of P. coarctata in the Bakkhali estuary, and were comparable with estuarine environments elsewhere.

AB  - The stable soil carbon (C) pool in coastal wetlands, referred to as "blue C", which has been extensively damaged by climate change and soil degradation, is of importance to maintain global C cycle. Therefore, to investigate the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration rate and evaluate C budgets in coastal wetlands are urgently. In this study, the diurnal and seasonal variation of soil respiration rate in the reed wetland land (RL) and the bare wetland land (BL) was measured in situ with the dynamic gas-infrared CO2 method in four seasons, and the factors impacted on the dynamic characteristics of soil respiration were investigated. The results showed that the diurnal variation of soil respiration rate consistently presented a "U" curve pattern in April, July, and September, with the maximum values at 12: 00 a.m. and the minimum values at 6: 00 a.m. In the same season, the diurnal soil respiration rate in RL was significantly greater than those in BL (P < 0.05). In April, July, and September, the mean diurnal soil respiration rate was 0.14, 0.42, and 0.39 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in RL, 0.05, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.01 mmol m(-2) s(-1) in BL, respectively. Soil surface temperature was the primary factor that influenced soil respiration, which was confirmed by the exponential positive correlation between the soil respiration rate and soil surface temperature in BL and RL (P < 0.05). In addition, the high salinity of soils suppressed soil respiration, confirming by the significantly negative correlation between soil respiration rate and the content of soluble salt. These results will be useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying soil respiration and elevating C sequestration potential in the coastal wetlands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper documents the occurrence of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) deposition inferred from a sedimentary record exposed in a salt-marsh trench in South-Central Chile. Sediments were carefully collected every 1 cm from the trench wall. The samples were analyzed for PCBs, HCHs, Cs-137, organic carbon and grain size. The Cs-137 fallout and the sedimentary signature left by the 1960 Chilean tsunami were used as temporal markers to estimate the stratigraphic chronology and the sedimentation rates. PCBs were quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD), and positive samples were confirmed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). Based On these results, PCBs and HCHs deposition over the last 40 years was estimated. No PCBs were detected below the tsunami signature. Total concentrations ranged front undetectable (ND) to 32 ng/g d.w. for PCBs and from undetectable (ND) to 1.29 ng/g d.w. for HCHs. The highest PCB concentrations were found in the Upper 7 cut of the core. Even though PCBs were banned in 1982 as electrical fluids in Chile, total estimated PCB fluxes have increased approximately 20 times during the last 40 years: from undetectable values to 102.6 ng/cm(2)/year, reflecting that PCBs are still in use and being released into the environment.

AB  - The concentrations of C, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ph and Cd were determined monthly in decomposing roots of Halmione portulacoides, using litterbag experiments, in two salt marshes of the Tagus estuary with different levels of contamination. Although carbon concentrations varied within a narrow interval during the experiment, litter decomposed rapidly in the first month (weight loss between 0.051 and 0.065 g d(-1)). The time variation of metals was examined in terms of Me/C ratios and metal stocks. Ratios of Fe/C and Mn/C and their metal stocks increased in spring, presumably due to the precipitation of oxides in the surface of decomposing roots. Subsequent decrease of Fe/C and Mn/C ratios suggests the use of Fe and Mn oxides, as electron acceptors, in the organic matter oxidation. Zinc, Cu, Pb and Cd ratios to C were, in general, higher than at initial conditions implying that metal that leached out was slower than carbon. However, metal stocks decreased during the experiment indicating that incorporation or sorption of metals in Fe and Mn oxides did not counterbalance the amount of Zn, Ph and Cd released from decomposing litter. An exception was observed for Cu, since stock in the less contaminated marsh (Pancas) increased during the decomposition, indicating that litter was efficient on Cu binding under more oxidising conditions. These results emphasize the importance of litter decomposition and sediment characteristics on metal cycling in salt marshes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A microcosm experiment was conducted to examine the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) contamination on the abundance and composition of microphytobenthos in surface (0-10 cm) sediments collected from a salt marsh in Pass Fourchon, LA. Plant pigment biomarkers were used to monitor changes in the microphytobenthos in sediments (over 60 days) with treatments containing high and low concentrations of PAMs. Grazing pressure on microphytobenthos by the periwinkle snail Littorina irrorata as well as its responses to PAH contamination were also examined.
   Concentrations of total PAHs declined in sediments over the duration of the experiment in all microcosms. There was a pattern of increasing relative abundance of high-molecular-weight PAHs in High-PAM sediments (5.5-16 ppm). Microphytobenthic biomass, estimated by chlorophyll-a concentrations, did not significantly change in the treatments with Low-PAM sediments (0.04-0.33 ppm); however, biomass decreased significantly in all treatments after 4 days from 64 mu g to 2-8 mu g g dry sed.(-1). Concentrations of the carotenoids fucoxanthin (a biomarker for diatoms) and zeaxanthin (a biomarker for cyanobacteria) were consistent with chlorophyll-a, showing little change in Low-PAM treatments; sediments from the High-PAM treatments showed significantly higher concentrations of fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin (1.8 and 1.2 mu g g dry sed(-1), respectively) than the Low-PAM treatments during the initial phase of the microcosm experiment. However, concentrations of fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin decreased dramatically after 4 days to 0.1-0.3 mu g g dry sed-L and 0.01-0.15 mu g g dry sed(-1): respectively. Increased total phaeophorbide concentrations (a biomarker for metazoan grazing) over the first 12 days of the experiment in treatments with and without L. irrorata additions indicated that meiobenthos may have been important in grazing-down microphytobenthos. High-Exposure snails (from High-PAM field sites) gained more weight during the initial phase of the experiment when microphytobenthic abundance was decreasing but eventually lost more weight than did Low-Exposure snails (from Low-PAM field sites) by the end of the experiment. Although there was considerable variability in the snail growth values, we speculate that the High-Exposure snails were more active in feeding during this experiment and, after the initial decline in microphytobenthos, became resource-limited throughout the remainder of the experiment.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora salt marshes occasionally exhibit areas where the plants have all died off for no apparent reason. These dieback areas remain devoid of plant growth for months to years. An analysis of microbial acetylene reduction activity (ARA) and porewater chemistry of four such diebacks has been carried out on marshes in the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, U.S.A. Four different diebacks were studied and sediments in all of them showed low rates of ARA, relative to sediments from the control areas which were populated by healthy S. alterniflora plants. The pore water of all the dieback sediments had higher salinities than the controls when this study began, but this trend was not consistent over the 18-month study period. Furthermore, dissolved ammonium and sulfide in the pore water, microbial biomass, organic matter and macro-organic matter content did not show a consistent trend differentiating the control and dieback sediments over this study period. During the course of this study, one of the diebacks recovered and the recolonisation of the barren area with healthy plants correlated with a full recovery of sediment ARA. The return of ARA to the sediments of this recovered marsh could not be correlated, however, with any of the porewater parameters measured (including NH4+), nor with any of the sediment characteristics. It is concluded that the lower levels of bacterial ARA in the diebacks may be due to the lack of essential factors associated with healthy spartina plants. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Photosynthetic carbon assimilation is dependent on the canopy-air CO2 concentration (Ca), which is an essential driving parameter of mechanistic models built to predict plant responses to changing environmental conditions. Short-term studies have shown that crop-canopy Ca undergoes substantial diurnal and seasonal variations as compared to Ca values measured several meters above plant canopies in well mixed conditions. Whether these canopy Ca patterns measured in crops also apply to wetland plant canopies and over long periods of time remains largely unknown. The first objective of this study was to analyze the consistency of short- and long-term Ca patterns in salt marsh canopies over a 10-year period. The second objective was to assess the impact of these canopy Ca patterns on simulated ecosystem productivity. In this study, we used Ca data collected from 1990 to 2000 in salt marsh canopies of the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The possible effects of short- and long-term canopy Ca patterns on plant productivity were simulated with a mechanistic model specifically adapted to the Scirpus olneyi vegetation of the salt marsh ecosystem. The annual average of daytime canopy Ca of a brackish marsh community rose by a significant (P < 0.01) 1.55 mumol CO2 mol(-1) year(-1) between 1990 and 2000, which parallels the atmospheric records of Mauna Loa over the same period of time. Annual Ca averages displayed some variability around this trend, which were highly correlated with the year-to-year variation in aboveground plant biomass (r(2) = 0.83, P < 0.001). Therefore, our study demonstrated that aboveground plant biomass is the main driver for inter-annual canopy Ca fluctuations. Daytime canopy Ca displayed maximum values in May and September and minimum values in July, with an amplitude of about 20 mumol CO2 mol(-1). The amplitude of the diurnal Ca cycle measured at the wetland appeared similar to that of North American agricultural ecosystems, exceeding 100 mumol CO2 mol(-1) in July and August and characterized by a sharp drop in the CO2 concentration shortly after dawn. Model simulations suggested that the increase in canopy Ca from 1990 to 2000 resulted in a substantial increase in Scirpus gross plant productivity (GPP) of 0.31% per year, which confirms that plant ecosystem simulations need to consider the actual increase in canopy Ca when the simulated time period exceeds a few years. Forcing the model with the measured diurnal Ca pattern increased the simulated net plant productivity (NPP) immediately after dawn and decreased it for the rest of the daytime period, which resulted in a simulated net NPP decrease of about 5% over the growing season.

AB  - Submerged and emergent wetland plant communities are evaluated for their response to global climate change (GCC), focusing on seagrasses, submerged freshwater plants, tidal marsh plants, freshwater marsh plants and mangroves. Similarities and differences are assessed in plant community responses to temperature increase, CO2 increase, greater UV-B exposure, sea level rise and other expected environmental alterations associated with GCC. Responses to most climate change variables are more similar within submerged plant communities, marine or freshwater, than between submerged vs. emergent plant communities. The submerged plants are most affected by temperature increases and indirect impacts on water clarity. Emergent plant communities (marshes and mangroves) respond most directly to climate change related hydrological alterations. Wetland plant communities overall appear to be adversely impacted by all climate change variables, with the exception of increased CO2 in the atmosphere and the oceans, which in most cases increases photosynthesis. Effects of GCC on all these communities have already been seen with many others predicted, including: shifts in species composition, shifts in range and distribution, and declines in plant species richness. Other effects are associated with specific community types, e.g., salt marsh habitat lost to mangrove incursion, and decreases in submerged macrophyte coverage in lakes and estuaries, exacerbated by eutrophication. Sea level rise poses threats to all aquatic plant community types in the vicinity of the oceans, and changes in weather patterns and salinity will affect many. Overall, losses are likely in all these wetland plant communities yet their species can adapt to GCC to some degree if well managed and protected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater marshes provide ecosystem services such as improving water quality by storing water and filtering nutrients from upland runoff, minimizing erosion and flooding by reducing stream and river velocity and peak flows, and carbon sequestration by storing organic matter for long extended periods of time. These ecosystem services have increased interest in the protection and restoration of marshes and soil properties and are an important consideration for successful restoration. This study was conducted in Indiana, USA, within the historical extent of the Grand Kankakee Marsh that once encompassed 202,343 ha, until the dredging of the Kankakee River from 1852 to 1917 to convert the marsh to cropland. Current (in 2019) soil properties (organic matter mass and concentration, bulk density, moisture content, and carbonate concentration) were compared between (1) marshes that were dredged and presently in other land-use categories such as cropland and forests, and (2) remnant marshes that were not impacted by dredging. On average, organic matter mass and concentration were not significantly different between dredged areas and marshes (p > 0.05). However, marshes tended to have lower bulk densities, greater moisture contents, and greater carbonate concentrations compared to dredged areas. The soil properties of remnant marshes in this study can be used to evaluate the success of marsh restoration efforts in regions with similar soils, climate, and land-use history.

AB  - Ecological succession and the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes are two major themes within microbial ecology, but these conceptual domains have mostly developed independent of each other. Here we provide a framework that integrates shifts in community assembly processes with microbial primary succession to better understand mechanisms governing the stochastic/deterministic balance. Synthesizing previous work, we devised a conceptual model that links ecosystem development to alternative hypotheses related to shifts in ecological assembly processes. Conceptual model hypotheses were tested by coupling spatiotemporal data on soil bacterial communities with environmental conditions in a salt marsh chronosequence spanning 105 years of succession. Analyses within successional stages showed community composition to be initially governed by stochasticity, but as succession proceeded, there was a progressive increase in deterministic selection correlated with increasing sodium concentration. Analyses of community turnover among successional stages-which provide a larger spatiotemporal scale relative to within stage analyses-revealed that changes in the concentration of soil organic matter were the main predictor of the type and relative influence of determinism. Taken together, these results suggest scale-dependency in the mechanisms underlying selection. To better understand mechanisms governing these patterns, we developed an ecological simulation model that revealed how changes in selective environments cause shifts in the stochastic/deterministic balance. Finally, we propose an extended-and experimentally testable-conceptual model integrating ecological assembly processes with primary and secondary succession. This framework provides a priori hypotheses for future experiments, thereby facilitating a systematic approach to understand assembly and succession in microbial communities across ecosystems.

AB  - Living shorelines are nature-based solutions to coastal erosion that can be constructed as salt marshes with fringing oyster reefs. Each of these habitats can decrease the potential for eutrophication through increased nitrogen (N) removal via denitrification. However, the development of N cycling over time has not been studied in living shorelines. This research measured denitrification rates in a chronosequence of living shorelines spanning 0-20 years in age in Bogue Sound, NC. Analyses were conducted seasonally from summer 2014 to spring 2015 along an elevation transect through the salt marsh, oyster reef, and adjacent sandflat at all sites. Gas fluxe (N-2 and O-2) from sediment core incubations were measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer (MIMS) to assess denitrification and sediment oxygen demand. Fluxes of dissolved nutrients and the greenhouse gas N2O were measured. Sediment properties, inundation frequency, oyster filtration rates, and marsh grass stem density were also quantified. There was no significant difference in denitrification rates among habitats. N removal consistently increased from the 0- to 7-year-old sites. Denitrification efficiency was always greater than 50% and positive N2O fluxes were negligible. Our results suggest that living shorelines increase net N removal within a relatively short time period following construction, without introducing deleterious greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that living shorelines can play an important role in estuarine N cycling and management.

AB  - Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats, including seagrass and macroalgal beds, mangrove forests and salt marshes, form highly productive ecosystems, but their contribution to the global carbon budget remains overlooked, and these forests remain "hidden" in representations of the global carbon budget. Despite being confined to a narrow belt around the shoreline of the world's oceans, where they cover less than 7 million km(2), vegetated coastal habitats support about 1 to 10% of the global marine net primary production and generate a large organic carbon surplus of about 40% of their net primary production (NPP), which is either buried in sediments within these habitats or exported away. Large, 10-fold uncertainties in the area covered by vegetated coastal habitats, along with variability about carbon flux estimates, result in a 10-fold bracket around the estimates of their contribution to organic carbon sequestration in sediments and the deep sea from 73 to 866 Tg C yr(-1), representing between 3% and 1/3 of oceanic CO2 uptake. Up to 1/2 of this carbon sequestration occurs in sink reservoirs (sediments or the deep sea) beyond these habitats. The organic carbon exported that does not reach depositional sites subsidizes the metabolism of heterotrophic organisms. In addition to a significant contribution to organic carbon production and sequestration, vegetated coastal habitats contribute as much to carbonate accumulation as coral reefs do. While globally relevant, the magnitude of global carbon fluxes supported by salt-marsh, mangrove, seagrass and macroalgal habitats is declining due to rapid habitat loss, contributing to loss of CO2 sequestration, storage capacity and carbon subsidies. Incorporating the carbon fluxes' vegetated coastal habitats' support into depictions of the carbon budget of the global ocean and its perturbations will improve current representations of the carbon budget of the global ocean.

AB  - Neurotoxic methylmercury (MMHg) is formed from inorganic divalent mercury (Hg2+). However, it is poorly understood to what extent different mercury (Hg) pools contribute to existent MMHg levels. In this study, ambient concentrations of total Hg (THg) and MMHg as well as rates of methylation and demethylation were measured simultaneously in sediments with and without salt-marsh plant vegetation, which were collected in Guadiana and Tagus estuaries, Portugal. Concurrent processes of Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation were directly monitored and compared by spiking sediments cores with stable isotope tracers of Hg-199(2+) and (CH3Hg+)-Hg-201 followed by gas chromatographic separation and isotope-specific detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared to the Guadiana estuary, where concentrations were comparatively low, THg and MMHg levels varied between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments collected at the Rosario site (ROS) of the Tagus estuary. Methylation (Km) and demethylation rates (K-D) were also different between estuaries being dependent on the presence of vegetation. In addition, the type of macrophyte species influenced KM and KD values. In fact, the highest KM value was found in Sarcocomia fruticosa vegetated sediments at the Castro Marim site in Guadiana (CM, 0.160 day(-1)) and the lowest KM was observed in non-vegetated sediments at the Alcochete site in Tagus (ALC, 0.009 day(-1)). KD varied by a factor of three among sites with highest rates of demethylation observed in non-vegetated sediments in Guadiana (12 13 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.4 +/- 0.2 h). This study clearly shows that the presence of vegetation in sediments favors the formation of MMHg. Moreover, this effect might be site specific and further studies are needed to confirm the findings reported here. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mangroves can store more sediment organic carbon (SOC) than freshwater and salt marshes. Understanding how mangroves have responded to historical sea-level rise (SLR) is fundamental to assessing their resilience and capacity to store carbon as SLR accelerates. We quantified landscape-level temporal and spatial trends in historical coastal wetland sediment accumulation and associated SOC content (i.e., storage) along coastal-to-inland gradients in Southeast Florida. The observed trends were transgressive and attributed to the historical rise in sea level. Our results indicate an overall significant increase in the SOC content of the historic wetland sediment succession caused by the vertical accumulation and landward migration of carbon-rich mangrove-dominated plant communities (mean = 0.08 g cm(-3)) into and over carbon-poor wet prairie plant communities (mean = 0.02 g cm(-3)). The observed historical increase in SOC is predicted to diminish over time as the difference between rates of SLR and vertical sediment accumulation increases and because the landward migration of mangrove-dominated plant communities is now obstructed by a shore-parallel flood-control levee. These results are likely to unfold in other low-latitude coastal wetlands where they are sandwiched between rising seas and an urbanized landscape.

AB  - 1. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a complex mosaic of tidal Freshwater habitats in California. is the focus of a major ecosystem rehabilitation effort because of significant long-term changes in critical ecosystem functions. One of these functions is the production, transport and transformation of organic matter that constitutes the primary food supply, which may be sub-optimal at trophic levels supporting fish recruitment. A long historical data set is used to define the most important organic matter sources, the factors underlying their variability, and the implications of ecosystem rehabilitation actions for these sources.
   2. Tributary-borne loading is the largest organic carbon source on an average annual Delta-wide basis; phytoplankton production and agricultural drainage are secondary; wastewater treatment plant discharge, tidal marsh drainage and possibly aquatic macrophyte production are tertiary; and benthic microalgal production, urban run-off and other sources are negligible.
   3. Allochthonous dissolved organic carbon must be converted to particulate form-with losses due to hydraulic flushing and to heterotroph growth inefficiency-before it becomes available to the metazoan food web. When these losses are accounted for, phytoplankton production plays a much larger role than is evident from a simple accounting of bulk organic carbon sources, especially in seasons critical for larval development and recruitment success. Phytoplankton-derived organic matter is also an important component of particulate loading to the Delta.
   4. The Delta is a net producer of organic matter in critically dry years but, because of water diversion from the Delta, transport of organic matter from the Delta to important, downstream nursery areas in San Francisco Bay is always less than transport into the Delta from upstream sources.
   5. Of proposed rehabilitation measures, increased use of floodplains probably offers the biggest increase in organic matter sources.
   6. An isolated diversion facility-channelling water from the Sacramento River around the Delta to the water projects-would result in substantial loading increases during winter and autumn, but little change in spring and summer when food availability probably matters most to developing organisms.
   7. Flow and fish barriers in the channel could have significant effects, especially on phytoplankton sources and in dry years, by eliminating 'short-circuits' in the transport of organic matter to diversion points.
   8. Finally, productivity of intentionally flooded islands probably would exceed that of adjacent channels because of lower turbidity and shallower mean depth, although vascular plants rather than phytoplankton could dominate if depths were too shallow. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A field study was conducted in 1996 and 1997 that examined effects of temporal and spatial variability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), macro-epifaunal abundance, and dissolved inorganic nutrients on the abundance and composition of microphytobenthos in salt marsh sediments in Pass Fourchon, LA (U.S.A.). Plans pigment biomarkers were used to monitor seasonal patterns in benthic microalgal abundance and composition across a PAH contamination gradient created by past produced-wafer pumping. The microphytobenthic community at Pass Fourchon was primarily composed of diatoms and cyanobacteria, as indicated by the carotenoid biomarkers fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin, respectively. Microphytobenthic abundance showed no consistent pattern of variation across stations or seasons; chlorophyll a concentrations generally ranged from 0.2 to 15.9 mu g g dry sediment(-1). Significantly higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were observed in porewaters at the highly contaminated (high PAHs) station; ammonium had the highest range (160 to 8500 mu M at Station la). Higher DIN concentrations were likely due to rapid remineralization of microphytobenthic detritus at the highly contaminated station. Microphytobenthic response to enhanced DIN availability was likely hindered by PAH toxicity and/or macro- and meiobenthic grazing effects. In September of each study year, significant seasonal increases in total PAH concentration in surface sediments were observed at the contaminated sire (Station 1a). Examination of PAH isomer ratios indicates this seasonal pattern was likely due to physical mixing events (i.e. storms) and not to changes in PAH inputs or preferential remineralization of certain PAHs.

AB  - Plant invasion may impact ecosystem structure and function, and further affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. However, the influence of plant invasion on soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools sizes, stability, and turnover in SOM of invaded ecosystems is not fully understood. In this study, soil C and N contents, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of free light fraction (LF), intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iP0M) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) were investigated in an invasive Spartina alterniflora community, adjacent bare flat and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Short-term S. alterniflora invasion significantly enhanced organic C and N contents in SOM, free LF, iPOM, mSOM compared with bare flat and increased the proportion of allocated C in iPOM compared with S. salsa and P. australis soils (0-0.30m depth). The proportion of the S. alterniflora-derived C in free LF and iPOM were significantly higher than that in mSOM, and the highest S. alterniflora-derived C content was found in iPOM of S. alterniflora soil. The most enriched delta N-15 values were found in S. alterniflora soil. Increased 815N values and decreased C:N ratios from the free LF to iPOM to mSOM in S. alterniflora soil indicated a greater degree of decomposition. The results suggest that 10-year S. alterniflora invasion significantly alters soil organic C and N pools sizes and stability through changing plant residuals input, physical distribution of S. alterniflora-derived C and C turnover in SOM fractions.

AB  - Measurements of O-2, Fe(II), Mn(II) and HS- in salt marsh sediments in the Tagus Estuary, Portugal, made with a voltammetric microelectrode, reveal strong seasonal differences in pore water composition within the 20 cm deep root zone. In spring, oxygen was below detection limit except close to the sediment surface. Fe( II) was present below 5 cm in concentrations ranging from detection limit to 1700 muM. In summer, oxygen was present in the pore water almost to the bottom of the root zone in concentrations ranging from detection limit to more than 100 muM. The spatial variability was intense: O-2 concentrations as high as 78 muM and as low as 25 muM existed within 2 mm of each other. Fe(II) was below detection limit except towards the bottom of the root zone. In late fall, oxygen was found to 8 cm depth, but in concentrations lower than in summer, and Fe(II) was present below 9 cm. Mn(II) was found at levels declining from typical values of 200 muM in spring to less than 20 muM in late fall. With one exception, sulfide was below the detection limit in all measurements. During periods when dissolved Fe(II) is available in the pore water at the same time as O-2 is delivered by roots, iron-rich concretions can form on roots. These conditions, which lead to precipitation of iron oxide in the sediment adjacent to roots, exist in spring, when new roots infiltrate anoxic Fe(II) containing sediment. They do not exist in summer, when dissolved Fe( II) is unavailable, or in winter, when oxygen is unavailable. The seasonal redox pattern revealed by the pore water chemistry is driven by the annual cycle of growth and decay of roots.

AB  - The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh,emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater proportion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelagic and benthic aquatic consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources available in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had delta(13)C values of -29 to -21 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of about 8 parts per thousand, which indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had delta(13)C values of -23 to -15 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of 5 to 15 parts per thousand resembling a mixture of Spartina spp., benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic consumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources far the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced in the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, consumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where its availability is the highest. Third, benthic and pelagic organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.

AB  - Marsh creation has come into increasing use as a measure to mitigate loss of valuable wetlands.  However, few programs have addressed the functional ecological equivalence of man-made marshes and their natural counterparts.  This study addresses structural and functional interactions in a man-made and two natural marshes.  This was done by integrating substrate characteristics and marsh utilization by organisms of two trophic levels.  Sediment properties, infaunal community composition, and Fundulus heteroclitus marsh utilization were compared for a man-made Spartina salt marsh (between ages 1 to 3 yr) in Dills Creek, North Carolina, and adjacent natural marshes to the east and west.  East natural marsh and planted marsh sediment grain-size distributions were more similar to each other than to the west natural marsh due to shared drainage systems, but sediment organic content of the planted marsh was much lower than in either natural marsh.  This difference was reflected in macrofaunal composition.  Natural marsh sediments were inhabited primarily by subsurface, deposit-feeding oligochaetes whereas planted marsh sediments were dominated by the tube-building, surface-deposit feeding polychaetes Streblospio benedicti and Manayunkia aestuarina.  Infaunal differences were mirrored in Fundulus diets.  Natural marsh diets contained more detritus and insects because oligochaetes, though abundant, were relatively inaccessible.  Polychaetes and algae were major constituents of the planted marsh Fundulus diet.  Though natural-marsh fish may acquire a potentially less nutritive, detritus-based diet relative to the higher animal protein diet of the planted marsh fish, Fundulus abundances were markedly lower in the planted marsh than in the natural marshes, indicating fewer fish were being supported.  Lower Spartina stem densities in the planted marsh may have provided inadequate protection from predation or insufficient spawning sites for the fundulids.  After three years, the planted marsh remained functionally distinct from the adjacent natural marshes.  Mitigation success at Dills Creek could have been improved by increasing tidal flushing, thereby enhancing access to marine organisms and by mulching with Spartina wrack to increase sediment organic-matter content and porosity.  Results from this study indicate that salt marshes should not be treated as a replaceable resource in the short term.  The extreme spatial and temporal variability inherent to salt marshes make it virtually impossible to exactly replace a marsh by planting one on another site.

AB  - Boundary habitats are frequently hot spots for the production and flow of organic matter (OM) and exert strong effects on ecological processes in the habitats which they link. Salt marshes, which are boundary habitats occurring between the land and the sea, are important sources of OM for coastal habitats. Primary productivity and tides are among the main causes of OM production and export from salt marshes. By field sampling and experiments we found that the stem-boring moth Haimbachia sp. nov. substantially increases the production of detritus in salt marshes along the SW Atlantic coastline. The larvae of this moth enhance the natural mortality of Spartina alterniflora and S. densiflora by feeding inside the basal and middle portions of the stem tissue. The attacks of the moth larvae produce dead and debilitated stems that are more easily broken and transported by the tides than non-attacked stems. Because the moth-attack frequencies will vary geographically in response to variation in the physical environment, the amount of OM flow between habitats will also vary, resulting in a positive relationship between moth-attack frequencies and OM production on a regional scale. Our field and experimental results show that herbivory by this moth and tidal transport could be the main determinants of the production of Spartina macrodetritus in these marshes. A key finding based on this previously undescribed interaction is that biological interactions (i.e. the effects of herbivores) can change the permeability of boundary habitats by altering the OM flow between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The arsenic (As) contents of sediment cores from the Patos Lagoon in southern Brazil were measured to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of As in the estuary. Sediment cores (ca. 60 cm) were obtained from three locations within the estuary to capture possible changes in As content across the salinity gradient (i.e., where saline, brackish, and freshwater dominated). Two sediment cores were collected at each location, one beneath open water and the other from the fringing salt marsh. Along with As, we quantified the particle size; redox potential (Eh); manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), total organic carbon (TOC), and free (dissolved) sulfide concentrations; and acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) contents. Bioturbation supports oxygen penetration to depths between 20 and 30 cm below the salt marsh surface, where an As- and Fe-rich zone was identified (3-fold higher As than mean As contents of the sediments). A similar subsurface peak of As, Fe, and Mn occurs in the open-water cores, albeit at greater depths between 40 and 50 cm below the surface. The subsurface peak has As concentrations that are 2-fold higher than the average for each core. Vertical profiles of Eh, free sulfides, and CRS for the shallow open-water cores showed similar distribution at depths of 50 cm, suggesting that pyrite formation is an important sink for As in the open-water cores. The data demonstrate clear differences in the geochemical conditions for salt marshes and shallow open waters that can have important implications for As distribution in estuarine sediments.

AB  - Estuarine tidal marshes play a key role in phosphorus (P) retention and cycling; however, they are suffering from small but significant increases in tidal saltwater intrusion. The likely impacts of these low-level saltwater intrusions on P availability and microbial activity are unclear. Here, we investigated soil P speciation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the phoD phosphatase gene community along a freshwater-oligohaline gradient in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The results indicated that with the transition from freshwater to oligohaline water, the levels of soil-water salinity, pH and sulfate content were greater, and ALP activity was lower, which were associated with higher concentrations of organic P, available P, aluminum-bound P, calciumbound P, and occluded P and lower levels of iron-bound P. There was a strong shift in the phoD phosphatase community composition in response to the freshwater-oligohaline gradient. Our findings showed that with the transition from freshwater to an oligohaline environment, in addition to the associated increases in salinity and soil pH and decreases in general microbial and biological activity and soil organic carbon, there is a shift in soil P toward more recalcitrant and immediately available fractions with less labile forms.

AB  - Acid phosphatase activity (APA) was measured in intertidal marsh sediments located along the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, at North Inlet, SC, and in a marsh on the Rowley River, MA. We found that APA increased from 4.3 +/- 2.3 to 29.3 +/- 18.8 pmol p-nitrophenol released g(-1) h(-1) with decreasing sediment salinity from 22 g l(-1) to 0.1 g l(-1). A study of APA kinetics revealed that the maximum specific activity (V-max) followed the same trend as in situ phosphatase activity. Sediment salinity (p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.43) and pH (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.56) were negatively correlated with APA, while soil organic matter (SOM) content (p < 0.01; R-2 0.57), clay content (p < 0.05; R-2 = 0.37) and sediment organic P (SOP) (p < 0.01; R-2 = 0.50) were positively correlated. Collectively, these variables accounted for 78% of the variation in APA (p < 0.05). APA was not significantly correlated with sulfide, NH4+, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), sediment total P, the N:P ratio, aboveground biomass, or macro-organic matter content. In salt marsh plots at North Inlet that were experimentally fertilized with N and P, we found that fertilization with only P had no effect on APA, while N-only or N + P fertilization significantly increased APA to 6.4 mu mol p-nitrophenol released g(-1) h(-1) from 1.5 mu mol p-nitrophenol released g-1 h-1 in control plots. However, even in the fertilized salt marsh plots, APA was still significantly lower than in freshwater, oligohaline and mesohaline marshes.

AB  - During 2004, 10 samplings were performed in order to measure dissolved methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the surface waters of Rio San Pedro, a tidal creek in the salt marsh area of the Bay of Cadiz (SW Spain). The inner partvs of the creek is affected by the inputs coming from an intensive fish farm and the drainage of an extensive salt marsh area.
   Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O concentrations ranged from 11 to 88 nM, 36 to 108 mu M and 14 to 50 nM, respectively. Surface waters were in all cases oversaturated with respect to the atmosphere, reaching values of up to 5000% for CH4, 1240% for CO2 and 840% for N2O. Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O showed a significant tidal and seasonal variability. Over a tidal cycle, concentrations were always highest during low tide, which points to the influence of the inputs from the fish farm effluent and the drainage of the adjacent salt marsh area, as well as in situ production within the system. Dissolved CH4, CO2 and N2O seasonal patterns were similar and showed maximum concentrations in summer conditions.

AB  - Field studies evaluated 1-octen-3-ol (octenol), carbon dioxide (dry ice), and a combination of both attractants in comparison with unbaited traps for collecting greenhead flies on a Massachusetts salt marsh. The carbon dioxide (CO2)-baited trap collections, and the CO2 with octenol-baited trap collections were more than 300% greater than the unbaited collections. The octenol-baited traps collected 83% more greenhead flies than unbaited traps. Afternoon trap collections were 2.5 times greater than morning collections. Dissections and measurements of a sample of the flies collected indicated that the ''cryptic species'' composition of greenhead flies was 77% Tabanus nigrovittatus and 23% Tabanus conterminus. Ovarian tracheole examinations of a sample of the flies showed that 99% of the greenhead flies had laid eggs before being trapped. The use of CO2 as an attractant in the traps could be cost effective in small problem areas, and the use of octenol in the box traps should be evaluated in large areas.

AB  - Salt marsh biogeochemical processes are regulated by ecosystem structure (e.g. plant community composition). However, plant-specific responses to stressors such as elevated nutrient inputs can have differing impacts on nitrogen (N) removal and carbon (C) sequestration. We conducted a field manipulation to investigate the impact of elevated nutrient loading on ecosystem C dynamics and nitrate reduction pathways (denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) in plots dominated by either Juncus roemerianus or Spartina alterniflora that were collocated in a northern Gulf of Mexico salt marsh. We increased N and phosphorus (P) inputs by two- and three-times current levels in the region. Nutrient enrichment had no effect on net ecosystem exchange. However, a three-fold increase in nutrient input resulted in nearly one-third increases in gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration in S. alterniflora plots, whereas there was no impact in J. roemerianus plots. Denitrification increased in S. alterniflora plots tenfold at both treatment levels relative to controls, but as with GPP, there was no response in J. roemerianus plots to higher nutrient inputs. In contrast, a three-fold increase in nutrients reduced DNRA by half in J. roemerianus plots. This work demonstrates that plant species-specific responses in marshes need to be considered for determining the impact of higher nutrient inputs on plant productivity and N-removal and retention.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon spill (2010) was the largest marine oil spill in US waters to date and one of the largest worldwide. To examine effects of the oil spill on an important salt marsh species over time, we conducted a meta-analysis on marsh periwinkles Littoraria irrorata using published and unpublished sources spanning more than 5 yr (2010-2015), including newly available Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA) and Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) data sets. We tested the hypotheses that the spill decreased mean periwinkle density, reduced mean snail shell length, and changed periwinkle size distribution. Averaged across multiple studies, sites, marsh zones (edge versus interior), and years, our synthesis revealed a negative effect of heavy oiling on periwinkles. Snail densities were reduced by 73% in heavily oiled sites across all study-zone-by-year combinations, including adverse effects for both the oiled marsh edge and oiled marsh interior, with impacts observed over more than 5 yr. Mean periwinkle shell length was somewhat reduced at the oiled marsh edge in a few cases; however, periwinkle size distributions displayed greater relative proportions of smaller adults and sub-adults, and fewer large adults, across all years. Given the spatial and temporal extent of data analyzed, this synthesis provides evidence that the Deepwater Horizon spill suppressed populations of marsh periwinkles in heavily oiled marshes for over 5 yr, and that impacts were ongoing and recovery was incomplete, likely affecting other ecosystem components, including marsh productivity, organic matter and nutrient cycling, marsh-estuarine food webs, and associated predators.

AB  - Although achieving functional equivalency of restored and natural ecosystems is a desirable restoration goal, direct assessments of function are rare, as are data supporting the use of indicators of function. The issue is how structural attributes can be used to assess ecosystem functioning. A functional equivalency index mixed both structural and functional measures, and an often-cited model of ecosystem degradation and restoration depicted a straight-line relationship between the two variables. Several points need clarification, not only for tidal wetlands but for restoration ecology generally. It is unrealistic to expect linear relationships among structure, function, and time; it is also inappropriate to assume, for natural and restored ecosystems, that equivalent structure means equivalent function. For example, using plant biomass to compare primary productivity rates assumes equal biomass:productivity relationships among sites; restored and natural wetlands are less likely to be similar in grazing, decomposition, and export rates than are two natural sites. Likewise, using soil organic matter (OM) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) to indicate nutrient availability may be less appropriate for restored and natural marsh comparisons than for two natural sites. We recommend that comparisons of structural attributes be labeled structural equivalency measures, thereby avoiding misconceptions. Useful structural measures for assessing tidal wetland restoration are: soil texture; soil OM, soil nutrients, vegetation structure (height distributions); invertebrate and fish populations (especially fish size distributions), and topographic complexity.

AB  - We investigated the impact of managed retreat on mercury (Hg) biogeochemistry at a site subject to diffuse contamination with Hg. We collected sediment cores from an area of land behind a dyke one year before and one year after it was intentionally breached. These sediments were compared to those of an adjacent mudflat and a salt marsh. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the sediment doubled after the dyke was breached due to the deposition of fresh sediment that had a smaller particle size, and higher pH. The concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) was 27% lower in the sediments after the dyke was breached. We conclude that coastal flooding during managed retreat of coastal flood defences at this site has not increased the risk of Hg methylation or bioavailability during the first year. As the sediment becomes vegetated, increased activity of Hg-methylating bacteria may accelerate Hg-methylation rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen (N) in wetlands and marshes is complex, involving inter-conversions between different N species, as well as transfers among various storage compartments. This review attempts to provide concise information on N dynamics in wetlands and marshes, and discuss contributing factors that may help to maximize removal of N from wastewater and stormwater runoffs at the same time reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to the atmosphere. In addition to interstitial water, N may be stored in above and belowground, live and dead plant material, invertebrates and microbes, and sorbed on the surfaces of organic and inorganic materials. The structure and functioning of the wetlands and marshes are subjected to anthropogenic activities, such as waterworks, land reclamation grazing and mowing, fertilization and various types of pollution, including heavy metals, nutrients, oil, etc. Nitrogen turnover in salt marshes is of particular interest since the primary production in salt marshes, as well as in adjacent coastal waters is considered to be limited by the supply of dissolved inorganic N. Salt marshes can function as sinks or as sources of N depending on their morphology and vegetation. Conversion pathways include ammonia volatilization, ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), dissimilatory reduction, and plant and microbial assimilation and remineralization during decomposition. The existence of an atmospheric sink, coupled with ammonia volatilization and microbially mediated nitrification and denitrification, make N as an excellent target for removal from wastewaters by constructed wetlands and marshes. However, such removal, specifically as N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere may not be as wise as previously thought as the concerns of global warming keeps looming. It is apparent that unless human-derived N inputs are regulated at the source, substantial biogeochemical modification of the global coastal ocean may occur because of cyclic processes within the coastal ocean system that are not rapid enough to dissipate the effects of the perturbations. Identifying the relative importance of various permanent and temporary sinks for N in wetlands may lead to methods of optimizing the utilization of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. The dynamics of N transformation within constructed wetlands is particularly a good candidate for long-term study to maximize the beneficial functions that wetlands can provide, and minimize adverse effects such as N2O emission to the atmosphere.

AB  - Tidal wetland fluxes of particulate organic matter and carbon (POM, POC) are important terms in global budgets but remain poorly constrained. Given the link between sediment fluxes and wetland stability, POM and POC fluxes should also be related to stability. We measured POM and POC fluxes in eight microtidal salt marsh channels, with net POM fluxes ranging between -12133 (export) and10228 (import)gOMm(-2)year(-1) and net POC fluxes ranging between -5214 and4312gCm(-2)year(-1). A regression employing two measures of stability, the unvegetated-vegetated marsh ratio (UVVR) and elevation, explained >95% of the variation in net fluxes. The regression indicates that marshes with lower elevation and UVVR import POM and POC while higher elevation marshes with high UVVR export POM and POC. We applied these relationships to marsh units within Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, finding a net POM import of 2,3551,570Mg OM/year (15 +/- 10g OMm(-2)year(-1)) and a net POC import of 1,263 +/- 632Mg C/year (8 +/- 4g Cm(-2)year(-1)). The magnitude of this import was similar to an estimate of POM and POC export due to edge erosion (-2,535Mg OM/year and-1,291Mg C/year), suggesting that this system may be neutral from a POM and POC perspective. In terms of a net budget, a disintegrating wetland should release organic material, while a stable wetland should trap material. This study quantifies that concept and demonstrates a linkage between POM/POC flux and geomorphic stability.
   Plain Language Summary The worldwide budgets of organic material, especially carbon, are important to understand future climate change, environmental health, and habitat change. Tidal wetlands and salt marshes are large banks of organic material and carbon that can store material over centuries or lose it quickly if they are eroded by waves or submerged by sea level rise. We measured the deposits and withdrawals from this organic material bank, at eight salt marshes across the United States. We found a wide range of deposits and withdrawals and determined that the budget is related to how stable the marsh is. Marshes with a lot of plants and more height were more likely to have deposits of organic materials, while marshes with less plants and less height had withdrawals. These results will help complete the accounting of organic material and carbon in worldwide budgets.

AB  - The quantitative significance of organic matter degradation in bringing about the early diagenetic mobility of anthropogenic trace metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) is assessed specifically in relation to the use of estuarine sediments as historical records of pollution. A 1,500 mm salt-marsh sediment depth profile from Tites Point, Severn Estuary, England, was sampled at 10-mm intervals. Organic carbon determinations were carried out by a wet oxidation technique, and 'organic fraction' metals were separated by sequential leaching. Results demonstrated that organic phase metals are quantitatively significant in Severn Estuary sediments, particularly Cu and Zn (Cu > Zn), and that metals are probably released from this fraction during early diagenesis. The degree of release, and the apparent loss of the released trace metals from the sediment, would suggest that the use of estuarine sediments as historical records of pollution requires qualification.

AB  - We aimed to assess the presence and availability of arsenic (As) in intertidal marshes of the Scheldt estuary. Arsenic content was determined in soils sampled at 4 sampling depths in 11 marshes, together with other physicochemical characteristics. Subsequently, a greenhouse experiment was set up in which pore water arsenic (As) concentrations were measured 4 times in a 298-day period in 4 marsh soils at different sampling depths (10, 30, 60 and 90 cm) upon adjusting the water table level to 0, 40 and 80 cm below the surface of these soils. The As content in the soil varied significantly with sampling depth and location. Clay and organic matter seem to promote As accumulation in the upper soil layer (0-20 cm below the surface), whereas sulfide precipitation plays a significant role at higher sampling depths (20100 cm below the surface). The As concentrations in the pore water of the greenhouse experiment often significantly exceeded the Flemish soil sanitation thresholds for groundwater. There were indications that As release is not only affected by the reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, but also by e. g. a direct reduction of As(V) to As(III). Below the water table, sulfide precipitation seems to lower As mobility when reducing conditions have been sufficiently established. Above the water table, sulfates and bicarbonates induce As release from the solid soil phase to the pore water.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential for regulating the global carbon budget through soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG - CO2, CH4, and N2O) fluxes. The conversion of coastal wetlands to agricultural land alters these fluxes' magnitude and direction (uptake/release). However, the extent and drivers of change of GHG fluxes are still unknown for many tropical regions. We measured soil GHG fluxes from three natural coastal wetlands - mangroves, salt marsh, and freshwater tidal forests - and two alternative agricultural land uses - sugarcane farming and pastures for cattle grazing (ponded and dry conditions). We assessed variations throughout different climatic conditions (dry-cool, dry-hot, and wet-hot) within 2 years of measurements (2018-2020) in tropical Australia. The wet pasture had by far the highest CH4 emissions with 1231 +/- 386 mgm(-2) d(-1), which were 200-fold higher than any other site. Dry pastures and sugarcane were the highest emitters of N2O with 55 +/- 9 mgm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period) and 11 +/- 3 mgm(-2) d(-1) (hot-dry period, coinciding with fertilisation), respectively. Dry pastures were also the highest emitters of CO2 with 20 +/- 1 gm(-2) d(-1) (wet-hot period). The three coastal wetlands measured had lower emissions, with salt marsh uptake of -0.55 +/- 0.23 and -1.19 +/- 0.08 gm(-2) d(-1) of N2O and CO2, respectively, during the dry-hot period. During the sampled period, sugarcane and pastures had higher total cumulative soil GHG emissions (CH4 C N2O) of 7142 and 56 124CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to coastal wetlands with 144 to 884CO(2-eq) kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (where CO2-eq is CO2 equivalent). Restoring unproductive sugarcane land or pastures (especially ponded ones) to coastal wetlands could provide significant GHG mitigation.

AB  - There is a need to quantify large-scale plant productivity in coastal marshes to understand marsh resilience to sea level rise, to help define eligibility for carbon offset credits, and to monitor impacts from land use, eutrophication and contamination. Remote monitoring of aboveground biomass of emergent wetland vegetation will help address this need. Differences in sensor spatial resolution, bandwidth, temporal frequency and cost constrain the accuracy of biomass maps produced for management applications. In addition the use of vegetation indices to map biomass may not be effective in wetlands due to confounding effects of water inundation on spectral reflectance. To address these challenges, we used partial least squares regression to select optimal spectral features in situ and with satellite reflectance data to develop predictive models of aboveground biomass for common emergent freshwater marsh species, Typha spp. and Schoenoplectus acutus, at two restored marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA. We used field spectrometer data to test model errors associated with hyperspectral narrowbands and multispectral broadbands, the influence of water inundation on prediction accuracy, and the ability to develop species specific models. We used Hyperion data, Digital Globe World View-2 (WV-2) data, and Landsat 7 data to scale up the best statistical models of biomass. Field spectrometer-based models of the full dataset showed that narrowband reflectance data predicted biomass somewhat, though not significantly better than broadband reflectance data [R-2 = 0.46 and percent normalized RMSE (%RMSE) = 16% for narrowband models]. However hyperspectral first derivative reflectance spectra best predicted biomass for plots where water levels were less than 15 cm (R-2 = 0.69, %RMSE = 12.6%). In species-specific models, error rates differed by species (Typha spp.: %RMSE = 18.5%; S. acutus: %RMSE = 24.9%), likely due to the more vertical structure and deeper water habitat of S. acutus. The Landsat 7 dataset (7 images) predicted biomass slightly better than the WV-2 dataset (6 images) (R-2 = 0.56, %RMSE = 20.9%, compared to R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 21.5%). The Hyperion dataset (one image) was least successful in predicting biomass (R-2 = 027, %RMSE = 33.5%). Shortwave infrared bands on 30 m-resolution Hyperion and Landsat 7 sensors aided biomass estimation; however managers need to weigh tradeoffs between cost, additional spectral information, and high spatial resolution that will identify variability in small, fragmented marshes common to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere in the Western U.S. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Using a multicomponent inverse model, we quantified the rates of organic matter (OM) remineralization and the relative importance of major terminal electron acceptors [Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides and SO42-] in salt marsh sediments with varying degrees of bioturbation and vegetation at Skidaway Island, Georgia. The model determined the rates of OM diagenesis by seeking simultaneous agreement between measured and model-calculated depth-concentration profiles of multiple major redox species while using the biological transport parameters determined from direct field observations. The OM degradation rates are found to be greater and penetrate deeper in sediments with vegetation or bioturbation than in sediments with limited macrobenthic components, in which organic matter degradation is restricted to the immediate vicinity of water-sediment interface. The results also confirmed previous observations that Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides are much more important than sulfate as terminal electron acceptors in the heavily bioturbated station and provided the numerical values to the depth-dependent relative importance. Solid-phase Fe is recycled as a terminal electron acceptor greater than or equal to30 times in the bioturbated station, because biological mixing repeatedly moves reduced Fe(II) back into the aerobic environment, where it is reoxidized to form Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxides and is reused as a terminal electron acceptor. Vegetation appears to have little influence on net solute transport, but it stimulates microbial activities and significantly enhances the remineralization of OM at depths.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are typically highly productive, and the sediments in these systems receive organic matter from a variety of local and imported sources. To assess if general patterns are present in the origin of carbon sources for sedimentary bacteria and their relation to the origin of the sediment organic carbon pool, we compiled both literature and new data on delta C-13 of bacterial biomarkers ( the phospholipid derived fatty acids i+a15:0), along with delta C-13 data on sediment organic carbon (delta C-13(TOC)) and macrophyte biomass from a variety of typical near-coastal systems. These systems included mangroves, salt marshes (both C3 and C4-dominated sites), seagrass beds, and macroalgae-based systems, as well as unvegetated sediments. First, our delta C-13(i+a15:0) data showed large variability over the entire range of delta C-13(TOC), indicating that in many settings, bacteria may depend on carbon derived from various origins. Secondly, systems where local macrophyte production is the major supplier of organic carbon for in situ decomposition are generally limited to organic carbon-rich, peaty sites (TOC > 10 wt%), which are likely to make up only a small part of the global area of vegetated coastal systems. These carbon-rich sediments also provided a field based estimate of isotopic fractionation between bacterial carbon sources and biomarkers (-3.7 +/- 2.1%), which is similar to the expected value of about -3% associated with the biosynthesis of fatty acids. Thirdly, only in systems with low TOC ( below similar to 1 wt%), we consistently found that bacteria were selectively utilizing an isotopically enriched carbon source, which may be root exudates but more likely is derived from microphytobenthos. In other systems with between similar to 1 and 10 wt% TOC, bacteria appear to show on average little selectivity and delta C-13(i+a15:0) data generally follow the delta C-13(TOC), even in systems where the TOC is a mixture of algal and macrophyte sources that generally are believed to have a very different degradability.

AB  - The classical outwelling hypothesis states that small coastal embayments (e.g. estuaries, wetlands) export their excess production to inshore marine waters. In line with this notion, the present study tested whether the Swartkops estuary acts as source or sink for carbon. To this end, concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined hourly during the first monthly spring and neap tides over one year in the tidal waters entering and leaving the estuary. Each sampling session spanned a full tidal cycle, yielding a total of 936 concentration estimates. Carbon fluxes were calculated by integrating concentrations with water flow rates derived from a hydrodynamic model calibrated for each sampling datum. Over the year, exports to marine waters markedly exceeded imports to the estuary for all carbon species: on the basis of total spring tidal drainage area, 1083 g m(-2) of DIC, 103 g m(-2) of DOC, and 123 g m(-2) of POC left the estuary annually. Total carbon export from the estuary to the ocean amounted to 4755 tonnes, of which 83% was in the inorganic form (DIG). Thus, the bulk of carbon moving in the water column is inorganic - yet, DIC seems to be measured only rarely in most flux studies of this nature. Salt marshes cover extensive areas in this estuary and produce some carbon, particularly DOG, but productivity of the local Spartina species is low (P:B = 1.1). Consequently, the bulk of carbon exported from the estuary appears to originate from the highly productive macroinvertebrate and the phytoplankton component and not from the salt marsh plants.

AB  - Tidal creek ecosystems integrate the coastal landscape by linking upland environments to the coastal ocean. These ecosystems feature a combination of sinuous creek beds with wide lateral wetlands interspersed with mud flats and oyster reefs. Previous studies demonstrated negative relationships between habitat quality and indicators of watershed urbanization. However, predicting trends in ecological robustness for a number of irregularly branched tidal ecosystems with different watershed attributes, material inputs, and flushing is a difficult task. This study began to address this task by using a simulation framework to assess water column and sediment ecological processes in two distinct tidal creek ecosystems in South Carolina (Malind Creek versus Okatee Creek). Biogeochemical cycling in these creeks fluctuates with hourly, daily, and seasonal changes in tidal exchange, freshwater and material inputs, and autochthonous primary production. Over 2 years simulation based on 2001-2002 input data an estimated 4-5 times more freshwater entered Okatee Creek than Malind Creek even though Okatee Creek watershed and basin areas are only 2.5X larger. Phytoplankton consumed approximately 70% of all water column dissolved nitrogen annually with autochthonous production the primary source of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (OC) to the sediments. Okatee Creek had approximately 7X the net deposition of OC to the sediments were it combined with sediment microalgal biomass to drive benthic secondary production. Differences in physical transport in salt marsh dominated tidal creeks influence the capacity to process, transform, and sequester introduced materials. Modifications to the simulation model will include improved depth, volume, and tidal exchange for more realistic prediction of effective concentrations. This modeling framework connects watershed and atmospheric material loading to estuarine productivity has been used to assess differences in ecosystem metabolism with changes in environmental drivers, and provides the foundation for a suite of sub-models to forecast the potential effects of relative sea level rise for a variety of nearshore environments.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are important CH4 sources to the atmosphere. Coastal wetlands account for similar to 10% of the total area of natural wetlands in China, but the size of this potential CH4 source remains highly uncertain. We introduced the influence of salinity on CH4 production and CH4 diffusion into a biogeophysical model named CH4MOD(wetland) so that it can be used in coastal wetlands. The improved model can generally simulate seasonal CH4 variations from tidal marshes dominated by Phragmites and Scirpus. However, the model underestimated winter CH4 fluxes from tidal marshes in the Yellow River Delta and YanCheng Estuary. It also failed to capture the accurate timing of the CH4 peaks in YanCheng Estuary and ChongMing Island in 2012. The improved model could generally simulate the difference between the annual mean CH4 fluxes from mangrove sites in GuangZhou and HaiKou city under different salinity and water table depth conditions, although fluxes were systematically underestimated in the mangrove site of HaiKou city. Using the improved model, the seasonal CH4 emissions simulated across all of the coastal wetlands ranged from 0.1 to 44.90 g m(-2), with an average value of 7.89 gm(-2), which is in good agreement with the observed values. The improved model significantly decreased the RMSE and RMD from 424% to 14% and 314% to -2%, respectively, and improved the EF from -18.30 to 0.99. Model sensitivity analysis showed that CH4 emissions were most sensitive to P-ox in the tidal marshes and salinity in the mangroves. The results show that previous studies may have overestimated CH4 emissions on a regional or global scale by neglecting the influence of salinity. In general, the CH4MOD(wetland) model can simulate seasonal CH4 emissions from different types of coastal wetlands under various conditions. Further improvements of CH4MOD(wetland) should include the specific characteristics of CH4 processes in mangroves to decrease the uncertainty in estimating regional or global CH4 emissions from natural wetlands.

AB  - Capacity of a wetland to remove nitrate through denitrification is controlled by its physicochemical and biological characteristics. Understanding these characteristics will help better to guide beneficial use of wetlands in processing nitrate. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and denitrification rate in Louisiana coastal wetlands. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from three different wetlands along a salinity gradient, namely, bottomland forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM) located in the Barataria Basin estuary. Potential denitrification rate (PDR) was measured by acetylene inhibition method and distribution of carbon (C) moieties in organic C was determined by C-13 solid-state NMR. Of the three wetlands, the FM soil profile exhibited the highest PDR on both unit weight and unit volume basis as compared to FS and SM. The FM also tended to yield higher amount of N2O as compared to the FS and SM especially at earlier stages of denitrification, suggesting incomplete reduction of NO3- at FM and potential for emission of N2O. Saline marsh soil profile had the lowest PDR on the unit volume basis. Increasing incubation concentration from 2 to 10 mg NO3--N L-1 increased PDR by 2 to 6 fold with the highest increase in the top horizons of FS and SM soils. Regression analysis showed that across these three wetland systems, organic C has significant effect in regulating PDR. Of the compositional C moieties, polysaccharides positively influenced denitrification. rate whereas phenolics (likely phenolic adehydes and ketonics) negatively affected denitrification rate in these wetland soils.

AB  - Sorption of organic compounds by coastal marine sediments is strongly affected by dry-wet cycling. In this Study, we determined how drying (and rewetting) sediment affected the decomposition rate of organic matter under both oxic and anoxic conditions, and how sorption changed with decomposition. Organic matter decomposition showed distinct patterns in dried, rewetted sediments compared to those that had never been dried, based on a comparison of ammonium production rates, OC/N ratios and total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) loss rates. Net ammonium production rates were 29 (oxic) and 44 mu M/d (anoxic) in dried, rewetted sediment and 4 (oxic) and 13 mu M/d (anoxic) in wet, never-dried sediment, indicating that a fraction of labile organic compounds like protein, was preferentially decomposed after a dry-wet cycle. The input of fresh organic matter from benthic fauna and microbes killed by the drying process may partially explain the faster remineralization rates in rewetted sediment. The decomposed organic matter in dried sediment might also come from resynthesized microbial biomass or its related byproducts, with low C/N ratios. Based oil comparisons between wet and dried sediments, we hypothesize that sedimentary organic matter (SOM) call assemble into 3D structures that play a significant role in the remineralization pathways of SOM. Drying not only changes the lability of salt marsh SOM, either through exposed proteinaceous matter or resynthesized matter by microbes, but also its sorption capacity. Lysine sorption was used as a probe to test the structural changes of sediment during the incubation. Lysine sorption in both wet and dried sediment remained relatively constant when sediments were incubated under anoxic conditions, although there was much stronger sorption in continuously wet sediment than in dried-rewetted sediment. Under oxic conditions, lysine sorption ill both dried and wet sediment decreased dramatically after a one-month incubation, and the pH in these samples also decreased accordingly, suggesting that Sulfide or ammonium might be oxidized to strong acids (H2SO4 and HNO3) that decrease lysine sorption. Overall, the structure of dried sediment did not appear to be reconstituted after 3-months of laboratory incubation.

AB  - Natural isotopic composition is a good tool to trace organic matter in ecosystems. Recent studies used a combination of molecular and stable isotope techniques to determine the origin of the organic carbon used by bacteria in the water column. In our study, we show that this procedure can be used for analysis of sediment bacterial communities with few modifications. In the water column, bacterial recovery is done before DNA extraction. In the sediment, we tested qualitatively and quantitatively a direct and indirect extraction of DNA. The direct extraction was the most efficient. It recovered between 3.1 and 15.8 mu g DNA g(-1). dry sediment and the contamination of field samples by eucaryotic DNA was less than 13%. In this preliminary study of the salt marsh ecosystem, the delta(13)C values of DNA (-26 to -24 parts per thousand) recovered from the sediment were close to the delta(13)C values of halophytic plants (-26.4 and -25.3 parts per thousand) showing a relationship between plants and microorganisms, Thus, this procedure can be used to trace the flow of carbon through the sediment microbial biomass and to understand the variation of bacterial activity according to the inputs of allocthonous and autochtonous organic matter.

AB  - A geochemical study of interstitial water and solid phase sediment using bulk concentration and geochemical partitioning was undertaken in vertical sediment profiles to trace diagenetic processes of lead (Pb) in hypersaline salt marsh sediments. In addition, we measured the stable isotopic composition of Pb in order to distinguish its input sources. Concentrations of Pb increased from low or background values in the bottommost layer (<60 cm depth), followed by fluctuations in the middle layer (20-60 cm) and peak values in the subsurface layer (3-5 cm). Pb associated to reactive fractions (e.g. OM, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates) accounted for 60% of that initially deposited. Stable Pb isotope data (Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-207/Pb-208) suggested that most of the Pb in the upper sediments (1.204 +/- 0.002 and 2.469 +/- 0.007) is still derived from the leaded gasoline combustion (1.201 +/- 0.006 and 2.475 +/- 0.005). Profile of dissolved Pb was related to those for ammonium, phosphates and dissolve Fe and Mn, which reveals the influence of the diagenetic reactions on the Pb behavior. OM. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and the sulfide minerals play a significant role for mobilizing and trapping the Pb. Metal mobilization was calculated considering an advective-diffusive system. The advective process constitutes the dominant mechanism of Pb mobilization. A low diffusive outflux with respect to the Pb mobilization rate suggested that most of the released Pb is retained in the sediments. Authigenic oxides precipitated at the oxic-suboxic layers (0-4 cm depth) and authigenic sulfide minerals formed Pb in the anoxic layers (7-20 cm depth) constituting the main scavengers for Pb that is diagenetically released. This retention has significant environmental implications because it reduces the availability and toxicity of Pb to biota, including humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The USDA/SCS in 1984 determined that there were 26 ecological communities in Florida. Using soil series names and possible plants in specific ecological communities from this study, sites were chosen from a soil characterization study. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the approximate relative natural background P concentrations in the A horizon of six ecological communities; 2) to group the ecological communities according to P concentration and 3) to correlate other soil parameters to P concentrations. Eighty-nine surface soils (A horizons) from six of these communities which included freshwater marshes, swamp, hardwoods, salt water marshes, south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs were selected. The communities had water table depths <1 m. Some communities were submerged under water part of the year. Geometric means of total soil P (TP) using a hypobromite determination ranged from 23 mg kg(-1) in the sloughs to 438 mg kg(-1) in the salt marshes. Soil extractable P (EP) using Mehlich I extracting solution ranged from 4.7 mg kg(-1) in the north Florida flatwoods to 64.5 mg kg(-1) in the salt water marshes. Using statistical analysis, the six communities could be separated in distinct groups. Using TP, the first group included swamp hardwoods, fresh water marshes and salt marshes, and the second group was south Florida flatwoods, north Florida flatwoods, and sloughs. A similar relationship was found for the EP. The correlation coefficient between EP and TP was r = 0.77. Correlations with other soil properties (clay, organic carbon, total Al, total Fe, total Ca) were also made, and the communities were found to be grouped in the same way as they did with EP and TP. This suggests that ecological communities can be grouped according to soil characteristics.

AB  - Phytoplankton community pigment composition and water quality were measured seasonally along salinity gradients in two minimally urbanized salt marsh estuaries in South Carolina in order to examine their spatial and temporal distributions. The North Inlet estuary has a relatively small watershed with minimal fresh water input, while the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto (ACE) Basin is characterized by a relatively greater influence of riverine drainage. Sampling stations were located in regions of the estuaries experiencing frequent diurnal tidal mixing and had similar salinity and temperature regimens. Phytoplankton community pigment composition was assessed by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and multivariate statistical analyses. Shannon diversity index, principal-component, and cluster analyses revealed that phytoplankton community pigments in both estuaries were seasonally variable, with similar diversities but different compositions. The temporal pigment patterns indicated that there was a relatively weak correlation between the pigments in ACE Basin and the relative persistence of photopigment groups in North Inlet. The differences were presumably a consequence of the unpredictability and relatively greater influence of river discharge in the ACE Basin, in contrast to the greater environmental predictability of the more tidally influenced North Inlet. Furthermore, the timing, magnitude, and pigment composition of the annual phytoplankton bloom were different in the two estuaries. The bloom properties in North Inlet reflected the predominance of autochthonous ecological control (e.g., regenerated nutrients, grazing), and those in ACE Basin suggested that there was greater influence of allochthonous environmental factors (e.g., nutrient loading, changes in turbidity). These interestuarine differences in phytoplankton community structure and control provide insight into the organization of phytoplankton in estuaries.

AB  - The present study aims at describing and analysing the floristic composition and vegetation types, as well as determining the effect of recent land uses on the vegetation structure. It aims also at identifying the alien plants species and elucidating the impact of these species on the plant diversity and community structure of the study area. One hundred and ninety stands were selected monthly for this study, 145 species were recorded (69 perennials and 76 annuals) related to 83 genera, 40 families in 9 identified habitats in El-Omayed Biosphere Reserve (coastal sand dunes, salt marshes, saline depression, non-saline depression, inland ridges, inland plateau, irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands). Therophytes were the most represented life form. Three habitat groups resulted after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA as classification and ordination techniques: 2 represented the natural habitats and one represented the urban and cultivated habitats. Group I represented coastal dunes and salt marshes GII: saline depressions, non-saline depressions, inland plateau and inland ridges and GIII: irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands. Coastal dunes had the highest species richness (a-diversity), followed by cultivated lands, while inland plateau had the lowest; but saline depressions had the highest species turnover (beta-diversity). Non-saline depressions had the highest relative evenness, while saline depressions had the highest relative concentration of dominance. Coastal dunes had highest values of calcium carbonates and calcium ions, and salt marshes had the highest salinity, pH, potassium and sodium contents, but cultivated lands had the highest values of silt, clay and organic matter. The diagram resulting from CCA showed an influence of most soil variables, except nitrogen, calcium and potassium. Twenty two species were recorded for the first time in the study area. The recent land use (overgrazing, wood cutting and collecting, construction of summer resorts and irrigation canals and agricultures) led to the emergence of new invasive species, which may severely affect the plant diversity and community structure of this hot spot of biodiversity in Egypt.

AB  - The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) constitute a globally significant carbon pool; the paleoecological record provides an opportunity to investigate long-term drivers of change in carbon accumulation and related changes in vegetation. We present a Holocene record from the Victor Fen site (VM-3-3) in Ontario's HBL to reconstruct vegetation history, quantify rates of carbon accumulation, and determine the role of paleoclimatic drivers. Pollen analysis indicates initiation of peat accumulation over a mineral substrate, accompanied by relatively rapid rates of carbon accumulation, following emergence from the Tyrrell Sea similar to 6900 yrs BP. The earliest vegetation assemblage consisted of a tidal marsh, quickly succeeding to a Typha marsh, then a poor fen dominated by Sphagnum and Cyperaceae by 6400 yrs BE Rapid rates of isostatic uplift at the time likely contributed to these changes. Once established, this fen community persisted without major vegetation change until the most recent century, when the abundance of shrub and Cyperaceae pollen increased, suggesting increasingly minerotrophic conditions. Average rate of long-term carbon accumulation (LORCA) for the whole record (mean = 22.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) is similar to other northern peatlands, and higher than the Holocene average for an adjacent bog. Increased precipitation after similar to 2400 yrs BP may have contributed to the higher LORCA reconstructed for the late Holocene, but the increased precipitation did not coincide with any apparent changes in vegetation as inferred from pollen assemblages.

AB  - While an increase in saltwater intrusion into historically freshwater environments will undoubtedly affect ecosystem functioning, the resultant impacts on litter decay and hydrolytic enzyme activities remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the decay of shichito matgrass stem litter, the associated loss of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the activity of litter- and sediment-associated hydrolytic enzymes in two subtropical tidal marshes (one brackish and one freshwater) in southeastern China. Results obtained after 202days of incubation revealed that there was no significant difference in litter mass loss between the brackish and freshwater marshes during both the standing phase (aerially decomposing litter) and the late phase of sediment-surface decomposition (slow decomposition of relatively refractory materials) (p>0.05). The loss of TC and TN from litter was most rapid during the first month of the sediment-surface phase, and the loss rates were significantly greater in the brackish marsh (mass loss 61.63%, TC released 50.55%, and TN released 36.40%) than in the freshwater marsh (mass loss 43.28%, TC released 46.31%, and TN released 41.31%). Moreover, we found significantly higher sediment-associated -glucosidase activities in brackish marsh sediments during the sediment-surface phase, and it correlated significantly with litter mass loss. The enhanced -glucosidase activities stimulated decomposition in the early sediment-surface phase in brackish marsh sediments; however, a decrease in decomposition caused by salinity and tidal SO42- levels at the last phase ultimately offset the previous difference. Our findings provide insight into the potential consequences of modest saltwater intrusion; these may not alter the rates of litter decomposition, but could change the dominant pathway.

AB  - The global extent of coasts is huge and it has a massive impact on the planetary C balance. Coasts are again very heterogeneous with their soils and sediments possessing varying C storing capacity. In this review, we tried to capture such capacity of soils and sediments of coastal natural ecologies (like estuary, mangrove, mudflat, tidal marsh, seagrass, lagoon, continental shelf etc.) and croplands collectively in a mechanistic way. A detail discussion highlights very high C accrual in coastal soils and sediments due to terrigenous C deposition, tidal sedimentation and presence of fine clay particles. Very high biomass of coastal mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass beds also results huge C burial in soils and sediments (blue C). Further, salinity and waterlogging induced low microbial activities, high soil aggregation and occlusion of C within aggregates impart prolonged residence time to C in coastal soils. All these confirm coastal ecology as a global C hotspot. However, climate change associated events like sea-level rise, ocean temperature increase, ocean acidification as well as human interferences have already affected the coasts and projected trend indicates severe possible damage of the coastal blue C in near future. Holistic sustainable measures will be required from different ends like government, local as well as international organizations to protect and restore the coastal C sink.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition of a range of organisms collected from two intermittently connected floodplain pools in the Ross River estuary were analysed to assess the extent to which carbon fixed by terrestrial wetland producers is incorporated into adjacent aquatic food webs. The two pools differed in surrounding vegetation with one surrounded by mangroves and the other by the salt couch Sporobolus virginicus. At both pools, animals showed differences in delta C-13, indicating differences in Sources of carbon. Since delta C-13 Values of C-3 mangroves (-29.7 to -26.3 parts per thousand) were very different from those of the C-4 salt couch (-16.3 to -15.4 parts per thousand,), it was possible to determine the importance of terrestrial wetland producers by comparing isotope values of consumers between sites, in a species by species approach. Most animal species collected showed lower 813 C at the mangrove pool than at the Sporobolus pool, which indicates a greater incorporation of mangrove carbon at the mangrove pool. However, the animals' isotopic shifts were also similar to that shown by epiphytes, and hence the differences in animal delta C-13 could also be a result of a dependence on these producers. The IsoSource model was useful to clarify this question, indicating that mangrove and salt marsh material was a crucial contributor to the diet of several fish and invertebrate species at both sites, indicating that carbon of terrestrial origin is incorporated in the estuarine food web.

AB  - The impact of marsh carbon export (outwelling) on estuarine metabolism has been debated for the last three decades. Much of this controversy stems from interpretations of stable isotope data. Although the outwelling of marsh carbon to the estuaries can be substantial, the stable isotope signal (delta C-13) Of marsh material is generally not detected except in sediments and infauna at marsh fringes. However, most of these studies focus on the delta C-13 Of either particulate organic carbon (POC) or the delta C-13 Of estuarine organisms that depend on POC, even though this carbon pool may be the least likely to provide a marsh signal. A series of simple models are developed to show how marsh outwelling affects the delta C-13 of POC and the other major estuarine carbon pools, i.e., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The models show that a marsh delta C-13 Signal will only be detected in estuarine POC or DIC when the marsh area is substantially larger than the estuary. However, because estuarine in-situ DOC production is only a fraction of POC production, our mixing models suggest that a marsh signal should be found in estuarine DOG, even when the marsh areas is smaller that the estuarine area. Finally, a transport model, incorporating a simplified bathymetry and hydrology for the Parker River, MA, is used to back calculate marsh outwelling from the estuarine delta C-13-DOC. The model estimate of marsh DOC outwelling is consistent with other estimates, and suggests that our parameterization of estuarine transport and degradation processes that regulate DOC isotope ratios is probably also correct.

AB  - Coastal "blue carbon," (carbon sequestered in salt marsh, mangroves, and seagrasses) is a newly recognized benefit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)). Protecting coastal carbon leads to co-benefits including resilience to storms and erosion, and fishery benefits, thus blue carbon is a "triple win" for climate mitigation, adaptation, and conservation.

AB  - Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems are an important coastal resource, as they provide a range of goods and services to the environment. They play a vital role in the global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, there has been a large reduction in the global BC ecosystems due to their conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, overexploitation, and removal for human settlements. Effectively monitoring BC ecosystems at large scales remains a challenge owing to practical difficulties in monitoring and the time-consuming field measurement approaches used. As a result, sensible policies and actions for the sustainability and conservation of BC ecosystems can be hard to implement. In this context, remote sensing provides a useful tool for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems faster and at larger scales. Numerous studies have been carried out on various sensors based on optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), aerial photographs (APs), and multispectral data. Remote sensing-based approaches have been proven effective for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems by a large number of studies. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on the applications of remote sensing techniques for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. The main goal of this review is to provide an overview and summary of the key studies undertaken from 2010 onwards on remote sensing applications for mapping and monitoring BC ecosystems. Our review showed that optical imagery, such as multispectral and hyper-spectral data, is the most common for mapping BC ecosystems, while the Landsat time-series are the most widely-used data for monitoring their changes on larger scales. We investigate the limitations of current studies and suggest several key aspects for future applications of remote sensing combined with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for mapping coastal vegetation and monitoring their extents and changes.

AB  - Climate greatly influences the structure and functioning of tidal saline wetland ecosystems. However, there is a need to better quantify the effects of climatic drivers on ecosystem properties, particularly near climate-sensitive ecological transition zones. Here, we used climate- and literature-derived ecological data from tidal saline wetlands to test hypotheses regarding the influence of climatic drivers (i.e., temperature and precipitation regimes) on the following six ecosystem properties: canopy height, biomass, productivity, decomposition, soil carbon density, and soil carbon accumulation. Our analyses quantify and elucidate linear and nonlinear effects of climatic drivers. We quantified positive linear relationships between temperature and above-ground productivity and strong positive nonlinear (sigmoidal) relationships between (1) temperature and above-ground biomass and canopy height and (2) precipitation and canopy height. Near temperature-controlled mangrove range limits, small changes in temperature are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in biomass and canopy height, as mangrove forests grow, expand, and, in some cases, replace salt marshes. However, within these same transition zones, temperature-induced changes in productivity are expected to be comparatively small. Interestingly, despite the significant above-ground height, biomass, and productivity relationships across the tropical-temperate mangrove-marsh transition zone, the relationships between temperature and soil carbon density or soil carbon accumulation were not significant. Our literature review identifies several ecosystem properties and many regions of the world for which there are insufficient data to fully evaluate the influence of climatic drivers, and the identified data gaps can be used by scientists to guide future research. Our analyses indicate that near precipitation-controlled transition zones, small changes in precipitation are expected to trigger comparatively large changes in canopy height. However, there are scant data to evaluate the influence of precipitation on other ecosystem properties. There is a need for more decomposition data across climatic gradients, and to advance understanding of the influence of changes in precipitation and freshwater availability, additional ecological data are needed from tidal saline wetlands in arid climates. Collectively, our results can help scientists and managers better anticipate the linear and nonlinear ecological consequences of climate change for coastal wetlands.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world in terms of ecosystem service value, and the strategic management of their carbon resources is an important part of climate change mitigation. Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained similar to 46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors. This synthetic work can provide a better understanding of how changing environmental and social conditions can lead to enhanced or degraded carbon sequestration rates in times of rapid global change.

AB  - The global decline of marine foundation species (kelp forests, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses) has contributed to the degradation of the coastal zone and threatens the loss of critical ecosystem services and functions. Restoration of marine foundation species has had variable success, especially for seagrasses, where a majority of restoration efforts have failed. While most seagrass restorations track structural attributes over time, rarely do restorations assess the suite of ecological functions that may be affected by restoration. Here we report on the results of two small-scale experimental seagrass restoration efforts in a central California estuary where we transplanted 117 0.25-m(2) plots (2,340 shoots) of the seagrass species Zostera marina. We quantified restoration success relative to persistent reference beds, and in comparison to unrestored, unvegetated areas. Within three years, our restored plots expanded similar to 8,500%, from a total initial area of 29 to 2,513 m(2). The restored beds rapidly began to resemble the reference beds in (1) seagrass structural attributes (canopy height, shoot density, biomass), (2) ecological functions (macrofaunal species richness and abundance, epifaunal species richness, nursery function), and (3) biogeochemical functions (modulation of water quality). We also developed a multifunctionality index to assess cumulative functional performance, which revealed restored plots are intermediate between reference and unvegetated habitats, illustrating how rapidly multiple functions recovered over a short time period. Our comprehensive study is one of few published studies to quantify how seagrass restoration can enhance both biological and biogeochemical functions. Our study serves as a model for quantifying ecosystem services associated with the restoration of a foundation species and demonstrates the potential for rapid functional recovery that can be achieved through targeted restoration of fast-growing foundation species under suitable conditions.

AB  - Humic acids (HAs) play an important role in regulating the biogeochemistry of soils and sediments. The chemical structural composition of humic substances in wetland soils especially at coastal zone, which is subjected to the influence of seawater intrusion, is not yet fully understood. In this study, HAs from soils of three wetland ecosystems along a salinity gradient namely, a forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM), from the Barataria basin of the Louisiana coast were isolated and characterized using elemental analysis, 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) with or without tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) treatment. Humic acids from the FS soil, the most inland of the three, showed the most aliphatic nature whereas HAs of the FM soil had the highest percentage of aromatics. There was a general increase in the crystalline domain of alkyl C in these wetland soil HAs along the salinity gradient. The Py-GC/MS TMAH thermochemolysis clearly showed a shift of lignin residues from the dominance of guaiacyl (G-type) and syringyl (S-type) structural units in FS HAs to p-hydroxyphenyl (H-type) structural unit in HAs of both marsh soils. In addition, there was a smaller Syringyl/Guaiacyl (S/G) ratio in the HAs of SM soil than FM soil, and an increasing contribution of sulfur compounds into their HA structural component as moving toward the coast, suggesting the formation of increasingly more recalcitrant nature of HAs along the salinity gradient in these wetlands. The C-13 NMR observation was, in general, consistent with the Py-GC/MS characterization. Overall, the result reveals a clear effect of salinity and vegetation on the molecular composition of HAs.

AB  - Sorption/desorption studies were conducted to determine desorption-resistance of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in recently deposited wetland peat soils. Sorption/desorption characteristics of chlorobenzene and phenanthrene were investigated for highly organic surface (top 0-2 cm) and deeper fresh marsh soil (below 10-cm) and low organic Petro Processors, Inc. Superfund site Devil's Swamp wetland soil (PPI soil) and Bayou Manchac soil (BM soil). A biphasic desorption model was used to fit the sorption/desorption data to explain the desorption-resistance in wetland soils. The results of biphasic desorption model indicated the presence of appreciable desorption-resistant phase in wetland soils. A finite maximum capacity of desorption-resistant fraction (q(max)(irr)) was observed after several desorption steps. When organic carbon normalized, q(max,oc)(irr) of the wetland soils was smaller than those of PPI and BM soils. The apparent organic carbon based partition coefficient (K-oc(irr)) for the desorption-resistant compartment was increasing in order of surface (10(4.32 +/-10.39)) < deeper (10(4.75+/-0.13)) <Ppi (10(5.39+/-0.09)) < BM (10(5.49+/-0.04)) soil. The results suggest that the effect of desorption-resistance on the bioavailability of sorbed HOCs should be considered in remediation and risk assessments in wetlands.

AB  - The impacts of plant invasions are of great concern in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycling. However, the consequences of plant invasions for soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine the effects of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on SOC pool and its fractions by comparing with native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis soils and bare flat in a coastal wetland of Eastern China for one year. Soil samples from S. alterniflora invaded soil, bare flat, S. salsa and P. australis soils were measured for the soil water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), cumulative CO2-C mineralization (MINC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the C:N ratio. Short-term S. alterniflora invasions significantly increased WSOC, MBC, MINC, SOC and TN levels in the upper 0-30cm soil layer compared to bare flat and native C-3 plant communities, but significantly decreased WSOC/SOC, MBC/SOC and MINC/SOC ratios relative to bare flat. S. alterniflora invasions also considerably increased aboveground and root biomass. The C:N ratio in S. alterniflora soil was significantly higher than that in S. salsa and P. australis soils, but with no difference from bare flat. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasions could enhance SOC sequestration possibly due to large amounts of litter biomass input but lower proportion of soil labile organic carbon pool fractions and mineralizable carbon in per unit SOC. Plant invasions could change the quantity and quality of the SOC pool and thus, have potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and global C cycling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The stable isotope signatures of marine transient and resident nekton were used to investigate trophic linkages between primary producers, marsh macrophytes, phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, and consumers within the Delaware Bay. A whole estuary approach was used to compare the flux of nutrients from primary producers to juvenile weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), and white perch (Morone americana) in open waters of the lower and upper Bay and adjacent salt marshes dominated by either Spartina alterniflora or Phragmites australis. Our results suggest that trophic linkages vary significantly along the salinity gradient, reflecting the transition from Spartina to Phragmites-dominated marshes, and secondarily, in a marsh to open water (offshore) direction at a given salinity. Superimposed on this pattern was a gradient in the proximate use of organic matter that depended on life history traits of each species ranging from pelagic to benthic in the order bay anchovy > weakfish > white perch.

AB  - Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC. is a New World warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical zone, perennial subshrub that is an important species in hypersaline coastal sites. Also known as sea ox-eye, it tolerates salinities ranging from less than 20 ppt to 130 ppt. It occurs in substrates low in organic matter and deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nearly all reproduction is vegetative from an extensive rhizome system. Populations of this species recover quickly after coverage by wrack. Stands of B. frutescens often dominate the landward border of salt marshes.

AB  - The worldwide loss of coastal wetlands has traditionally been addressed as the loss of ongoing nutrient retention ecosystem services. However, nutrient remineralization from eroded particles may further exacerbate water quality degradation. Using data on nutrient burial and denitrification from northern Chesapeake Bay, along with estimates of the bioavailability of eroded marsh particulates, the changing role of wetlands as an important sink for nutrients is examined. Although the erosion of wetlands results in the reintroduction of nitrogen and phosphorus into open-water habitats, the potential for exacerbating eutrophication is highly diminished by the low lability of wetland organic matter. The impact of such erosion on the cycling of Fe-bound phosphorus from marsh soils is highly dependent on both the amount of inorganic P, its solid phase association with Fe, and its potential remobilization from the estuarine sediments into which it is deposited. Although nutrient sequestration in newly constructed wetlands built from dredged materials suggested a rapid development of nutrient sequestration, a better understanding of nutrient ecosystem services provided by marshes created by transgression into uplands is necessary for understanding the long-term nutrient retention value of coastal wetlands.

AB  - An energy flow network was constructed for the Kromme estuary, South Africa. Extensive data, collected on this estuary, were used to calculate the energetics of each of the 27 compartments identified in this system. The model consists of three non-living and 24 living compartments. The non-living compartments were dissolved organic carbon (DOG), suspended and sediment particulate organic carbon (POC), while the living compartments consisted of four plant groups, three bacterial groups and 17 animal groups. The animals range from meiofauna to macrofauna and fish. Biomass of all compartments were estimated in mg C m(-2) and exchanges in mg C m(-2) day(-1). It was found that the main primary producers are the marsh halophytes and macrophytes. It seems that although the salt marshes cover only 38% of the Kromme estuary, the marsh halophytes contribute 78% of the total primary production, making it the most important producer in this estuary. Less than 10% of the halophyte production enters the grazing food-chain, with the remainder being broken down to sediment detritus. This indicates that the sediment detritus, as well as the animals that feed on it, forms the most important part of this food-web. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

AB  - The diked and freshened Herring River estuary (Wellfleet, Massachusetts) experiences regular summer hypoxia and one- to three-week periods of main stream anoxia, often accompanied by fish kills.  Stream hypoxia results from the temperature-dependent increase in oxygen demand of organic matter released by diked salt marsh deposits; periods of total anoxia are induced by heavy rains which increase the runoff of wetland organic matter.  Historic reductions in tidal flushing have extended the low salinity region of the estuary normally characterized by high organic loads and minimal flushing.  Recurrent main stream anoxia has depressed both migratory and resident aquatic fauna.

AB  - Estuaries are considered one of the most dynamic ecosystems in the world, ensuring high production and transfer of large quantities of organic matter (OM) from continents to the ocean. Despite the large influence of estuaries in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, our understanding of OM dynamics in these buffering coastal environments remains fragmented. In this frame, our study was carried out to describe and understand the main drivers of OM distribution in two estuaries (Canche, Authie) of the eastern English Channel, based on descriptive and quantitative approaches. For this purpose, in February and March 2018, surface sediments were sampled at low tide along cross-shore transects in the intertidal zone of each estuary. Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total OM content, atomic TOC/TN ratio, delta 13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate OM inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary OM in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of OM in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the OM pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary OM by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the OM dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.

AB  - Past studies of microbial communities responsible for geochemical transformations have been limited by an inability to representatively cultivate, and then identify, the constituent members. Ribosomal RNA sequences, particularly 16S-like rRNAs, provide a measure of phylogenetic relationship that can now be used to examine the structure and diversity of microbial communities. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the sulfur cycle and the terminal mineralization of organic matter in estuarine and marine environments. Because the Gram-negative mesophilic SRB comprise a phylogenetically coherent assemblage, their communities are well suited to explorations through rRNA sequence-based methodologies. In this study we related molecular biological methods using rRNA probes to geochemical measurements at two different sites. At an unvegetated site in northwest Florida, rates of sulfate reduction were low and SRB rRNA comprised about 5% of the total rRNA extracted from the sediment. The other site, a salt marsh in New Hampshire, had higher rates of sulfate-reduction with SRB rRNA accounting for up to 30% of the total rRNA extracted from the sediment. SRB community structure differed dramatically between the two sites with Desulfobulbus rRNA much less abundant in the unvegetated site than in the salt marsh. The differences in these SRB communities reflect differences in the ecology of their habitats.

AB  - Modern theories of life history evolution deal with finding links between environmental factors, demographic structure of animal populations and the optimal life history strategy. Small-sized teleost fish, occurring in fragmented populations under contrasting environments, have been widely used as study models to investigate these issues. In the present study, the Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus was used to investigate the relationships between some habitat features and life history strategy. We selected four sites in the Venice lagoon inhabited by this species, exhibiting different combinations of two factors: overall adult mortality, related to intertidal water coverage and a consequent higher level of predator exposure, and the level of sediment organic matter, as indicator of habitat trophic richness. Results showed that these were the two most important factors influencing demography and life history traits in the four sites. Fish from salt marshes with high predator pressure were smaller and produced a higher number of eggs, whereas bigger fish and a lower reproductive investment were found in the two closed, not tidally influenced habitats. Habitat richness was positively related with population density, but negatively related with growth rate. In particular the synergy between high resources and low predation level was found to be important in shaping peculiar life history traits. Results were discussed in the light of the interactions between selective demographic forces acting differentially on age/size classes, such as predation, and habitat trophic richness that may represent an important energetic constraint on life history traits. The importance to link habitat productivity and morphology to demographic factors for a better understanding of the evolution of life history strategy under contrasting environments was finally suggested.

AB  - Wetlands can potentially affect global climate change through their role in modulating the atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH4). Their overall CH4 emissions, however, remain the greatest uncertainty in the global CH4 budget. One reason for this is the paucity of long-term field measurements to characterize the variability of CH4 emissions from different types of wetlands. In this study, we quantified CH4 emissions from a brackish, oligohaline Cyperus malaccensis marsh ecosystem in the Min River Estuary in southeast China over five years. Our results showed substantial temporal variability of CH4 emissions from this brackish marsh, with hourly fluxes ranging from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 3.7 mg m(-2) h(-1) (mean +/- 1 SD) during the study period. The inter-annual variability of CH4 emissions was significantly correlated with changes in soil temperature, precipitation and salinity, which highlighted the importance of long-term observations in understanding wetland CH4 dynamics. Distinct seasonal patterns in soil CH4 production rates and porewater CH4 concentrations also were observed, and were both positively correlated with CH4 emissions. The seasonal variations of CH4 emissions and production were highly correlated with salinity and porewater sulfate levels. The mean annual CH4 efflux from our site over the five-year period was 23.8 +/- 18.1 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that subtropical brackish tidal marsh ecosystems could release a large amount of CH4 into the atmosphere. Our findings further highlight the need to obtain high-frequency and continuous field measurements over the long term at multiple spatial scales to improve our current estimates of wetland CH4 emissions.

AB  - Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical's secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas.

AB  - Paleosols contain information about the rates of soil organic carbon turnover when the soil was actively forming. However, this temporal information is often difficult to interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C-14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C-14 age spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C-14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C-14 ages within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C-14 ages from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C-14 ages from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<<300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C-14 age of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C-14 ages also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise.

AB  - Ant mounds often occur at high densities in marsh wetlands. However, little information is available regarding their impacts on soil nutrient pools in these ecosystems. We studied C-org, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in above-ground ant mounds and in soils under mounds for three ant species (Lasius flavus, Lasius niger and Formica candida), and estimated their contribution to the total soil nutrient pools in a marsh wetland. Ant impacts were greatest in above-ground soils. All measured nutrient concentrations in above-ground mounds were significantly higher than the average values in reference soils (upper 25 cm). However, except for DOC, no significant differences for nutrient concentrations existed between soils under mounds and reference soils. The impacts of ant mounds on soil C and nutrient concentrations varied by ant species. L. niger above-ground mounds stored less C-org, TN and NO3- than F. candida and L. flavus mounds, or reference soils. At the ecosystem scale, soils in above-ground mounds and under ant mounds all contained less C-org per hectare than the reference soils. Total amounts in nutrient pools from mounds of the three ant species comprised from 5.3% to 7.6% of the total in natural marsh soils. More importantly, ant mounds increased the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient pools. Thus, ant mounds can be important to a fully integrated understanding of the structure and function of wetland nutrient cycles and balances. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sedimentary organic matter content of a series of 2-m-deep cores was investigated along a sea-land transect at five sites representing five species of mangrove and salt-marsh vegetation. The vegetation was settled at the same place for at least 1000 years and therefore sedimentary organic matter deriving from the decay of higher plants has accumulated in large amounts. The global morphological and chemical preservation of the organic matter attested by various sedimentary parameters, including the proportions of cellulose-bearing tissues, the TOC contents, the C/N ratios, the total sulphur contents and the delta(13)C compositions, reveals that the sedimentary organic matter is less degraded when it has been under the influence of the marine water table for a long time. This is indicated by a good correlation between the salinities of interstitial waters, the redox potentials measured in the wet sediments and the chemical composition of the organic matter. Moreover, the concentration of organic sulphur shows a positive correlation with the hydrogen index (HI), only under the marine water-table influence, suggesting the very local presence of sulphur-HC compounds.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate patterns of pyrite accumulation found in a Juncus roemerianus tidal marsh of north Florida. We speculate that the pattern of pyrite accumulation was caused mainly by the distribution of roots. Sediment cores from living stands (LS), dead stands (DS), and recently killed stands (RKS) were collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOG), sulfate, chloride, Cr(II)-reducible sulfide, and biomass of roots and rhizomes. Living roots were distributed mainly in the upper 16 cm and concentrated at 4-10 an below the sediment surface. Pyrite accumulations were significantly different among the three types of sediment cores in the upper 16 an sediment and follow the descending order of DS (615 mu mol cm(-3)) > RKS (547 mu mol cm(-3)) > LS (368 mu mol cm(-3)). Between 20 cm and 30 an, pyrite contents approached values of 40 mu mol cm(-3) and 55 mu mol cm(-3) in all sediment cores. The degree of pyritization approaches 92-94% between 14 an and 20 an where pyrite accumulation was probably limited by available iron. Root distribution also affected the redistribution of iron through iron sulfide formation. Sulfate depletion in the upper 16 cm was higher in RKS (79.3 mu mol cm(-3)) than DS (49.1 mu mol cm(-3)). No significant sulfate depletion was found in LS. Sulfate reduction under DS was likely limited by the readily available substrates. Root distribution had a major influence on pyrite accumulation and sulfate reduction of the marsh, and its effects need to be addressed in studies of wetland sulfur dynamics.

AB  - Organic matter is the dominant pool of reduced carbon in marine and freshwater systems. Mineralization of organic matter is largely attributed to complex and diverse microbial communities that mediate degradation and ultimately yield the terminal respiratory product, carbon dioxide (CO2). The factors that constrain the lability and degradation of organic matter remain unclear, but they involve a complex interplay between structural and chemical properties of the compounds, physical properties of the matrices, and the functional potential of the microorganisms that are present. To investigate these relationships, we developed a novel bioreactor system-called Isotopic Carbon Respirometer-Bioreactor (IsoCaRB)-that permits real-time monitoring of microbial CO2 production rates and collects sequential samples of this CO2 for off-line isotopic analyses (C-13, C-14). Application of this system to organic-rich sediments from Salt Pond, MA reveals that organic matter is oxidized both abiotically and microbially, and that the pattern of microbial respiration by the native sediment community is complex, accessing different carbon substrates over the course of incubation. Isotopic measurements show modern organic matter of progressively older ages (<= ca. 50 yr) is consumed, and this material has variable origins (salt marsh grasses, terrestrial, and marine organic matter). Collectively, the IsoCaRB system provides coupled insights into the sources, ages, and inherent biological and abiotic reactivity of natural organic matter.

AB  - Four sites were selected in a salt marsh in the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina): (I) low marsh (flooded by the tide twice daily) vegetated by S. alterniflora; (2) non-vegetated low marsh; (3) high marsh (flooded only in spring tides) vegetated by S. alterniflora; (4) non-vegetated high marsh. The pH and Eh were measured in sediments, while dissolved nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate) and particulate organic matter (POM) were determined in pore water. pH (6.2-8.7) was only affected by vegetation in low areas. Eh (from 300 to 250 mV) was lower at low sites than at high ones; in the latter, the values were higher in the non-vegetated sediments. The POM concentration was greater in the high marsh than in the low marsh, with no effect of vegetation. Ammonium was the most abundant nitrogen nutrient species in pore water, except in the non-vegetated high marsh where nitrate concentration was higher. All nitrogen nutrients were affected by both flooding and vegetation. Phosphate was always present in pore water at all sites throughout the year and its concentration varied within narrow limits, with no effect of flooding and greater values always at non-vegetated sites. Our results showed that the variability of the pore water composition within the marsh is greater than the temporal variation, meaning that both tidal flooding and vegetation are important in the dynamics of nutrients and organic matter in the sediment pore water.

AB  - Policies aiming to preserve vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCE; tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions require national assessments of blue carbon resources. Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5-11% of the C stored in VCE globally (70-185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055-1,540 Tg C in the upper 1 m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1-3.1 Tg CO2-e yr(-1), increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12-21%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - History revealed that people had been discharging a large proportion of carbon into the atmosphere through fossil fuel consumption and the marine environment. These have prompted atmospheric carbon fixations that have proved to be larger than at any other point throughout the human survival. Due to the critical role of blue carbon in the ocean carbon cycle, it is essential to pay extra attention to these habitats (mangrove, seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and coral reefs). Hence, this article reviews the recent developments in blue carbon biomass estimation using a geospatial approach and highlighted the blue carbon components achievements and gaps. Biomass and soil carbon estimation, using change detection analysis, were reviewed. Analysis of the carbon conversion factors, used in converting biomass to carbon, was demonstrated. The review shall act as support for the realization of the target 14.2 and 14.5 of the 14(th) sustainable development goal established by the United Nations, to fast track the achievement of the 2020 agenda.

AB  - Quantifying living roots in a marsh is a necessary but difficult task in wetland research. The two main difficulties usually encountered are distinguishing living from dead roots and processing a dense mat of fine roots. We found that living roots of salt-marsh plants release much more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in boiling water than dead roots. Based on this finding, we developed a DOC procedure to quantify living roots of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus. The DOC released in boiling water is a function of root activity, and the amount released can be used to calculate the living root biomass of a sample. The amount of living roots determined by the DOC method correlated well with the amount of living roots determined by the manual sorting method (r2 = 0.78, p < 0.01). The DOC method is more objective, precise, and much less tedious than the manual sorting method.

AB  - The invasion of Phragmites australis into tidal marshes formerly dominated by Spartina alterniflora has resulted in considerable interest in the consequences of this invasion for the ecological functions of marsh habitat. We examined the provision of trophic support for a resident marsh fish, Fundulus heteroclitus, in marshes dominated by P. australis, by S. alterniflora, and in restored marshes, using multiple stable isotope analysis. We first evaluated our ability to distinguish among potential primary producers using the multiple stable isotope approach. Within a tidal creek system we found significant marsh and elevation effects on microalgal isotope values, and sufficient variability and overlap in primary producer isotope values to create some difficulty in identifying unique end members. The food webs supporting E heteroclitus production were examined using dual isotope plots. At both sites, the delta(13)C values of E heteroclitus were clustered over values for benthic microalgae (BMI) and approximately midway between delta(13)C values of Spartina and Phragmites. Based on comparisons of fish and primary producer delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S values, and consideration of E heteroclitus feeding habits, we conclude that BMI were a significant component of the food web supporting F heteroclitus in these brackish marshes, especially recently-hatched fish occupying pools on the marsh surface. A 2parts per thousand difference in delta(13)C between Fundulus occupying nearly adjacent Spartina and Phragmites marshes may be indicative of relatively less reliance on BMI and greater reliance on Phragmites production in Phragmites-dominated marshes, a conclusion consistent with the reduced BMI biomass found in Phragmites marshes. The mean delta(13)C value of F heteroclitus from restored marshes was intermediate between values of fish from naturally occurring Spartina marshes and areas invaded by Phragmites. We also examined the isotopic evidence for ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of larval and juvenile F heteroclitus. We found significant positive relationships between E heteroclitus WIN values and total length, reflective of an increase in trophic position as fish grow. F heteroclitus delta(15)N values indicate that these fish are feeding approximately two trophic levels above primary producers.

AB  - Twenty-eight tidal creeks were sampled along the South Carolina coast in the summer of 1995 to determine the levels of sediment trace metal contamination associated with different types and varying levels of human development in their watersheds. The particle size and total organic carbon (TOC) content of creek sediments in developed watersheds (i.e., industrial, urban, and suburban) were similar to that in watersheds with little or no development (i.e., forested or reference). Those trace metals commonly associated with urban and industrial sources, including Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg, were in significantly higher concentrations in tidal creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds compared to the suburban and forested watersheds. Sediment trace metal concentrations were similar for creeks located in suburban and forested watersheds and 2 to 10 times lower than the creeks located in industrial/urban watersheds. Concentrations of trace metals primarily associated with the natural weathering of basement rock, including Al, Fe, As, Ni, and Mn, were not significantly different among watershed types. Four of the tidal creek-salt marsh systems were extensively sampled from the creek channel to the marsh-upland interface to characterize sediment trace metal spatial distributions within creek-marsh systems. Sediment particle size, TOC, and trace metal concentrations varied spatially within each creek-marsh system depending on the type of development in the watershed and the probable source of metals. The creek-marsh system selected to represent the industrial development had significantly higher "anthropogenic" trace metal concentrations compared to the other creek-marsh systems. This system also had trace metal distributional patterns that appeared to be associated with several localized sources of metals on the marsh surface. Both the "anthropogenic" and "natural" trace metal concentrations and spatial distributions were similar among and within the forested and suburban creek-marsh systems.

AB  - This study characterizes humic substances (HS) from two soils colonized by Spartina maritima at different physiographical positions in estuarine environments on the north-western coast of the Iberian Peninsula: the Villaviciosa site, a stand close to the main tidal channel, and the Ortigueira site, located in the low salt marsh. Humic and fulvic acids were extracted from the soils and characterized qualitatively by the following spectroscopic techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.
   The characterized HS showed a predominance of low humified compounds with a high proportion of aliphatic components and a low degree of aromaticity. The HS composition differed substantially between sites. In the Villaviciosa soil, the large amount of nonpolar aliphatic components and the very low degree of aromaticity may indicate a significant contribution of marine organic matter and/or microbial material to the HS. However, in the HS from the Ortigueira soil, the higher proportion of polysaccharides together with the presence of lignin-derived compounds may indicate greater inputs of vascular plant material. The delta C-13 isotopic Composition of the bulk soils highlights the large input of Spartina maritima debris to the Ortigueira site. whereas in the Villaviciosa site, organic contributions from this C4 vascular plant were not so evident.
   The results indicate that in these soils colonized by Spartina maritima, physiographical position has an important effect on the composition of soil HS and, therefore, must be considered in the study of organic matter characteristics in such estuarine environments.

AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7-16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.

AB  - Organic carbon and total nitrogen as well as stable carbon (delta C-13(org)) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopic ratios were determined on suspended matter, settling particles and bottom sediments collected from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary during the summer flood period in 2001. From the results, three sources of suspended matter, riverine, deltaic (salt marshes) and marine (East China Sea - ECS) were distinguished. The resuspended particulate organic matter contents in the water column increased with the amount of total suspended matter (TSM) indicating the role of dispersive and/or turbulent mixing and its control over the high TSM concentration in the Changjiang Estuary. This and an active resuspension/deposition in the estuary determine the nature of organic matter in suspended materials reaching the East China Sea. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geostatistical techniques were used to assess the spatial patterns of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils from two contrasting plant communities: a salt marsh containing only arbuscular mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants in a distinct clumped distribution pattern and a maquis with different types of mycorrhiza where most plants were relatively randomly distributed. Also evaluated was the relationship between the spatial distribution of spores and AM plant distribution and soil properties. A nested sampling scheme was applied in both sites with sample cores taken from nested grids. Spores of AMF and soil characteristics (organic matter and moisture) were quantified in each core, and core sample location was related to plant location. Semivariograms for spore density indicated strong spatial autocorrelation and a patchy distribution within both sites for all AM fungal genera found. However, the patch size differed between the two plant communities and AM fungal genera. In the salt marsh, AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with distance to AM plants and projected stand area of AM plants. In maquis, spatial AM fungal spore distribution was correlated with organic matter. These results suggest that spore distribution of AMF varied between the two plant communities according to plant distribution and soil properties.

AB  - Given the severity of injuries to biota in coastal wetlands from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DWH) and the resulting availability of funding for restoration, information on impacted salt marshes and biotic development of restored marshes may both help inform marsh restoration planning in the near term and for future spills. Accordingly, we performed a meta-analysis to model a restoration trajectory of total macroinfauna density in constructed marshes (studied for similar to 30 y), and with a previously published restoration trajectory for amphipods, we compared these to recovery curves for total macroinfauna and amphipods from DWH impacted marshes (over 8.5 y). Total macroinfauna and amphipod densities in constructed marshes did not consistently reach equivalency with reference sites before 20 y, yet in heavily oiled marshes recovery occurred by 4.5 y post spill (although it is unlikely that macroinfaunal community composition fully recovered). These differences were probably due to initial conditions (e.g., higher initial levels of belowground organic matter in oiled marshes) that were more conducive to recovery as compared to constructed marshes. Furthermore, we found that amphipod trajectories were distinctly different in constructed and oiled marshes as densities at oiled sites exceeded that of reference sites by as much as 20x during much of the recovery period. Amphipods may have responded to the rapid increase and high biomass of benthic microalgae following the spill. These results indicate that biotic responses after an oil spill may be quantitatively different than those following restoration, even for heavily oiled marshes that were initially denuded of vegetation. Our dual trajectories for oil spill recovery and restoration development for macroinfauna should help guide restoration planning and assessment following the DWH as well as for restoration scaling for future spills.

AB  - This chapter examines the geochemistry of carbon and the nutrient elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon) in the sediments of estuaries and near-coastal seas. The emphasis is on the sources, storage, and transformations that occur in sediments during storage on decadal to centennial timescales. Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and phosphate are used to help differentiate sources and to help predict the effects of early diagenesis in the sediment stores. The principal sediment stores of C, N, P, and Si are muds and silts of shoal water or inner-shelf river deltas and non-deltaic, often estuarine, coasts. These stores comprise coastal mud banks (sub-tidal/intertidal), salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. The influence of human management of the coastal zone is reviewed, especially with respect to increasing sediment storage capacity, carbon burial, and greenhouse gas production.

AB  - PREMISE Biological invasions increasingly threaten native biodiversity and ecosystem services. One notable example is the common reed, Phragmites australis, which aggressively invades North American salt marshes. Elevated atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen pollution enhance its growth and facilitate invasion because P. australis responds more strongly to these enrichments than do native species. We investigated how modifications to stomatal features contribute to strong photosynthetic responses to CO2 and nitrogen enrichment in P. australis by evaluating stomatal shifts under experimental conditions and relating them to maximal stomatal conductance (g(wmax)) and photosynthetic rates.
   METHODS Plants were grown in situ in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) and porewater nitrogen (N-enr) in a Chesapeake Bay tidal marsh. We measured light-saturated carbon assimilation rates (A(sat)) and stomatal characteristics, from which we calculated g(wmax) and determined whether CO2 and N-enr altered the relationship between g(wmax) and A(sat).
   RESULTS eCO(2) and N-enr enhanced both g(wmax) and A(sat), but to differing degrees; g(wmax) was more strongly influenced by N-enr through increases in stomatal density while A(sat) was more strongly stimulated by eCO(2). There was a positive relationship between g(wmax) and A(sat) that was not modified by eCO(2) or N-enr, individually or in combination.
   CONCLUSIONS Changes in stomatal features co-occur with previously described responses of P. australis to eCO(2) and N-enr. Complementary responses of stomatal length and density to these global change factors may facilitate greater stomatal conductance and carbon gain, contributing to the invasiveness of the introduced lineage.

AB  - Soil organic matter, roots, rhizomes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates were examined in minerogenic marshes of the North Inlet Estuary, a system dominated by sediment depositional processes and typical of the Southeast USA. Three marsh sites were sampled: a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment at Goat Island; the high marsh, low marsh, and creekbank of Crab Haul Creek, a fringing marsh that only receives drainage from a forested watershed; and three creekbank locations in Debidue Creek, which receives drainage from a residential and golf course development situated at its headwaters. Goat Island responses to 12 years of nutrient fertilization were an increase in soil organic matter (OM), an increase in number of rhizomes, enlarged rhizome diameters, and increased CO2 emission rates. At soil depths of 10-20 cm, all Debidue creekbank locations had significantly more rhizomes than the reference Crab Haul creekbank. The rhizome diameters at the mid and upper Debidue creekbank locations were significantly larger than the Debidue mouth and reference Crab Haul creekbank. The upper Debidue and the Crab Haul creekbanks had similar soil percent OM, which was significantly greater than the mid Debidue, which was greater than the Debidue mouth. CO2 emission rates at the fertilized Goat Island plots were similar in magnitude to the upper Debidue and significantly greater than the Goat Island control plots and the reference Crab Haul Creek. Inputs of sediment in marshes dominated by depositional processes may buffer the system from adverse effects of nutrient exposure, while increases in soil OM and rhizomes in response to nutrients may contribute to peat formation.

AB  - Tidal freshwater marshes can protect downstream ecosystems from eutrophication by intercepting excess nutrient loads, but recent studies in salt marshes suggest nutrient loading compromises their structural and functional integrity. Here, we present data on changes in plant biomass, microbial biomass and activity, and soil chemistry from plots in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (GA) fertilized for 10 yr with nitrogen (+N), phosphorus (+P), or nitrogen and phosphorus (+NP). Nitrogen alone doubled aboveground biomass and enhanced microbial activity, specifically rates of potential nitrification, denitrification, and methane production measured in laboratory incubations. Phosphorus alone increased soil P and doubled microbial biomass but did not affect microbial processes. Nitrogen or P alone decreased belowground biomass and soil carbon (C) whereas +NP increased aboveground biomass, microbial biomass and N cycling, and N, P, and C assimilation and burial more than either nutrient alone. Our findings suggest differential nutrient limitation of tidal freshwater macrophytes by N and microbes by P, similar to what has been observed in salt marshes. Macrophytes outcompete microbes for P in response to long-term N and P additions, leading to increased soil C storage through increased inputs of belowground biomass relative to N and P added singly. The susceptibility of tidal freshwater marshes to long-term nutrient enrichment and, hence their ability to mitigate eutrophication will depend on the quantity and relative proportion of N vs. P entering estuaries and tidal wetlands.

AB  - The natural stable isotope values of different plants have been used to trace the fate of organic carbon that enters estuarine ecosystems, Experiments were designed to determine the magnitude of delta C-13 changes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from tidal marsh vegetation that occurred during bacterial decomposition, Bacteria were grown on DOC leached from estuarine Spartina alterniflora and Typhus angustifolia plants, In four experiments, 25 to 80% of the initial carbon (2.6 to 9.1 mM organic C) was converted to bacterial biomass and CO2. Mass balance calculations showed good recovery of total C and C-13 at the end of these experiments (100% +/- 14% total C; +/- 1 parts per thousand delta C-13). The delta C-13 values of DOC, bacterial biomass, and respired CO2 changed only slightly in the four experiments by average values of -0.6, +1.4, and +0.5 parts per thousand, respectively. These changes are small relative to the range of delta C-13 values represented by different organic carbon sources to estuaries. Thus, microbial delta C-13 values determined in the field helped to identify the source of the carbon assimilated by bacteria.

AB  - Sediment collections on a mainland hinging marsh, a lagoon marsh and a barrier island hinging marsh were conducted in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of aerial photographs to relate changes in marsh area to sedimentary processes. The island marsh lost 7.2% of its area in 8 years by overwash. The lagoon marsh lost 10.6% of its area over 41 years by recession of marsh edges. The mainland marsh area increased by 8.2% over 50 years, primarily by upland encroachment. Surface sediment was collected monthly at the mainland and lagoon marshes for 1 year to identify changes in the mean grain size, organic content and mass of sediment deposited on sampling plates. Short-term variability in these characteristics obscured seasonal differences. Grain size and monthly sediment accumulation decreased towards the interior of both marshes, while the organic matter content increased. On the lagoon marsh, coarse sediment at creekside stations, as well as grain size contrasts between surface and subsurface sediment, are consistent with erosion evident in GIS analysis. On the mainland marsh, sediment does not vary as much with location or depth, and topography appears stable. Tidal currents appear to be competent to resuspend most particle sizes represented in surface sediment samples, including aggregates, except at the edge of the lagoon site. Decreasing rates of marsh edge change reflect moderation of oceanic processes, while the interior of both lagoon and mainland marshes remained stable throughout the study. Both lagoon marsh losses to recession and mainland marsh gains from upland reflect the submergence which this shoreline experiences. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - The influence of natural sediments colonized by Juncus maritimus (rhizosediments) on the microbial rhizosphere communities and their potential for hydrocarbons degradation was investigated. Rhizosediments from four salt-marsh sites of a temperate estuary (Lima River, NW Portugal) were sampled throughout the plant phenological cycle, for sediment characterization, total petroleum hydrocarbons, abundance and structure of microbial community, and hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms. Additionally, evaluation of hydrocarbon degradation potential was assessed from fortnight laboratory experiments, With and without crude oil amendment. Silt + Clay and organic matter (OM) content influenced the retention of hydrocarbons around plant roots by increasing their levels. Those parameters tended to correlate positively with total microbial abundance but negatively with hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms, a fact that could be related to lower hydrocarbon bioavailability. Rhizosediment laboratory experiments without crude oil amendment showed a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between hydrocarbon degradation rates and OM and Silt + Clay content, confirming the strong influence of rhizosediment characteristics on hydrocarbons bioavailability. This is the first insight into the influence of natural sediment characteristic on the hydrocarbon degradation potential of salt marsh microorganisms, a feature that should be considered when designing rhizoremediation strategies in estuaries.

AB  - Wild capture fisheries provide substantial input to the global economy through employment and revenue. The coastal zone is especially productive, accounting for just 7% of the total area of the ocean, but supporting an estimated 50% of the world's fisheries. Vegetated coastal ecosystems-seagrass meadows, tidal marshes and mangrove forests-are widely cited as providing nutritional input that underpin coastal fisheries production; however, quantitative evidence of this relationship is scarce. Using Australia as a case study, we synthesized fisheries stable isotope data to estimate nutritional input derived from coastal vegetated ecosystems and combined these "proportional contribution" estimates with total annual catch data from commercial fisheries to determine species-specific dollar values for coastal vegetated ecosystems. Based on the data from 96 commercially important fish species across Australian states (total landings 14 x 10(6) tonnes pa), we provide a conservative estimate that Australia's coastal vegetated ecosystems contribute at least 78 million AUD per year to the fisheries economy. Two thirds of this contribution came from tidal marshes and seagrasses that were both equally valued at 31.5 million AUD per year (39.4%) followed by mangroves at 14.9 million AUD per year (18.6%). The highest dollar values of coastal ecosystems originated from eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) and giant mud crab (Scylla serrata). This study demonstrates the substantial economic value supported by Australia's coastal vegetated ecosystems through commercial fisheries harvest. These estimates create further impetus to conserve and restore coastal wetlands and maintain their support of coastal fisheries into the future.

AB  - Superficial sediment characteristics of salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated sites were compared in Paranagua Bay, SE Brazil, in order to assess the influence of Spartina alterniflora. Twenty stations were sampled along a salinity and environmental gradient, from the inner to the outer bay, to provide a first characterization of sediment distribution along the tidal flats. Paranagua Bay was then divided into three different sectors according to the hydrodynamic regime and sediment characteristics. The mesohaline sector is characterized by typically fluid sediments, with the predominance of medium silt, and high organic and water contents. Deposits of the middle polyhaline sector are poorly sorted, very fine sands, with variable organic matter content. Sediments in the higher-energy euhaline sector are well-sorted fine sands, with lent organic content. Four sampling sites were chosen in different sectors to assess whether S. alterniflora marshes can introduce differences in sediment texture along spatial and seasonal gradients. Differences in sediment parameters between marshes and unvegetated tidal flats are not evident in the inner sector, but are increasingly significant towards the high-energy euhaline sector. With the exception of water and organic content, the latter usually higher in summer, seasonal differences in sediment parameters are not significant. The results suggest that differences between the sediments of salt marshes and adjacent unvegetated tidal flats are positively correlated with the environmental energy gradient along Paranagua Bay. Sand unavailability and high sedimentation rates lead to a marked sedimentological homogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated flats in the upper reaches of the bay. On the other hand, S. alterniflora is a major source of sediment heterogeneity between vegetated and unvegetated sites in the high-energy euhaline sector, characterized by more mature sediments.

AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems that can sequester large quantities of carbon. However, variation in physiological potential can alter their capacity to sequester carbon. To examine variation in ecosystem physiological capacity, we established three coastal marsh sites in Mississippi and Alabama spanning a productivity gradient. Over 1 year, we measured ecophysiological activity and spectral indices in two vegetation zones within each marsh to develop a better understanding of variation in ecosystem responses and health. Gross ecosystem exchange of carbon and ecosystem respiration rates (R-eco) differed significantly among sites, with the highest activity at Grand Bay, Mississippi and Point Aux Pines, Alabama and lower ecophysiological activity at Dauphin Island, Alabama. Net ecosystem exchange was similar for all three study areas because greater carbon assimilation was negated by higher levels of respiration. Spectral indices and leaf area were significantly different by marsh vegetation zone, suggesting that alterations in species composition and plant productivity can have important implications for carbon sequestration. While limited to 1 year, this study establishes a foundation by which to evaluate future research conducted over greater temporal and spatial scales, thereby enhancing our understanding of marsh physiological activity.

AB  - The relative importance of hydrological conditions and upstream processes on the input and transport of organic carbon from land to sea was investigated in the Mullica River, a small system located in the southeastern New Jersey (USA), using molecular and delta C-13 compositions. Sediment and particulate organic carbon (POC) samples were collected along the river, from upstream (draining predominantly pine-oak forests) in the Pinelands to the Great Bay Estuary (bordered by salt marshes) under normal and high flow conditions. During base river flow, terrestrial biomarkers (e.g., diterpenoids - conifer biomarkers) were detected predominantly upstream and sharply decreased downstream. From mid to down river sites, a mixture of higher plants (primarily from the salt marsh vegetation) and microbial biomarkers (e.g., mycose, cholesterol) predominated. delta C-13 abundances of individual fatty acids presented a consistent pattern, with depleted values (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -30.9 parts per thousand on average) upstream, becoming heavier toward the Great Bay (e.g., delta C-13(sed) = -23.1 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -22.8 parts per thousand). During the high discharge event, significant amounts of upland biomarkers (e.g., pimaric acid, ferruginol, ursolic acid) and depleted delta C-13 values were observed from the Pinelands (delta C-13(sed) = -34.6 parts per thousand) to mid river (delta C-13(sed) = -32.0 parts per thousand; delta C-13(POC) = -30.8 parts per thousand), clearly demonstrating the transport of terrestrial material farther down river. However, downstream of this point, the occurrence of the terrestrial material strongly decreased, demonstrating that terrestrial plant biomarkers were not transported in significant amounts to the estuarine region, even at high river discharge. Since the mid river site is situated in the upper limit of salt water intrusions, it is likely that flocculation and sedimentation provide a depositional sink for terrestrial OC in the mid Mullica River, thereby depleting the terrigenous signature in downstream OC.

AB  - To understand the influence of river discharges on the biogeochemical cycling of organic matter (OM) in estuarine sediments, we conducted chemical and isotopic analyses of surface sediment samples collected from the Altamaha estuary (Georgia, USA) in March 2002 (high discharge period) and October 2002 (low discharge period). Chemical and isotopic analyses included bulk parameters (TOC, TN, delta C-13(TOC) and delta N-15(TN)), chlorophyll-a (Ch1-a), lipids (fatty acids, alcohols, and sterols) and lipid carbon isotopic compositions. Bulk parameters were apportioned with a three-end-member mixing model and biomarkers were processed using principal component analysis (PCA). The modeling indicated that OM from C3 terrestrial and marine sources dominate (> 80%) at most sediment sites during the two periods while C4 salt marsh plants contribute a large fraction (similar to 40%) of OM at one site during the low discharge period. The PCA demonstrated that more allochthonous OM deposits in the high discharge period while more autochthonous OM accumulates in the low discharge period; OM in the high discharge period is relatively fresh while that in the low discharge period is highly degraded. Distributions of bacteria-specific fatty acids in the estuarine sediments followed the same patterns as Ch1-a, algal lipids, and mixed lipids but were not correlated with terrestrial lipids, suggesting that the microbial community in the sediments depends largely on OM from phytoplankton rather than from terrestrial higher plants. When salt marsh plants became an important input into the sediments, bacteria efficiently used this OM, indicated by the coincident changes between molecular isotope ratios of bacteria-specific fatty acids and bulk delta C-13(TOC).

AB  - Ljubljana marsh in Slovenia is a 16 000 ha area of partly drained fen, intended to be flooded to restore its ecological functions. The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (similar to 30 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization (CO2 and CH4 production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding (> 5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period of 84 d at 15 degrees C and a minimum of 7 d at 37 degrees C, the optimum temperature for methanogenesis. This lag was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H-2 and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14-38 degrees C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91%) mcrA (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found. Our results suggest that methane emission can remain transient and low if water-table fluctuations allow re-oxidation of ferrous iron, sustaining iron reduction as the most important process in terminal carbon mineralization.

AB  - In two tidal freshwater marshes, methane emission, production and accumulation in the pore-water have been studied. The two sites differ in their dominant vegetation, i.e., reed and bulrush, and in their heights above sea level. The reed site was elevated in relation to the bulrush site and had higher rates of methane emission and production. It is argued that this difference in methane emission between sites was primarily due to a different effect of reed and bulrush plants on methane dynamics rather than methane oxidation related to tidal elevation. Methane emission showed strong seasonality related primarily to plant physiology and only secondarily to temperature. Two control sites at which vegetation was removed systematically had lower emission rates indicating an overall stimulating effect of plants on methane emission from tidal marshes. Flooding reduced methane emission, probably by blocking the primary sites of methane release in the lower part of the plant stems.

AB  - Temporal oscillations in hydrology are a common occurrence in wetlands and can result in alternating flooded and drained conditions in the surface soil. These oscillations in water levels can stimulate microbial activities and result in the mobilization and redistribution of significant amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). The goal of this study was to experimentally simulate a drawdown and reflood of marsh soil from a nutrient-enriched site and a reference site of a wetland (Blue Cypress Marsh Conservation Area, Florida). The goal was to better understand the changes in biogeochemistry and microbial activities present in these soils as a result of hydrological fluctuations. Measurements of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), ammonia, and nitrate in the floodwater indicated significantly higher (alpha = 0.05) NH4+ and DRP fluxes from the nutrient-enriched site; floodwaters in the cores from both sites contained significant NO3- concentrations (9.6 mg N L-1), which was rapidly consumed over the core incubation period (30 it). Water level drawdown and reflooding initially stimulated the soil microbial biomass, methanogenic rates, and extracellular enzyme activities (acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase). The anaerobic microbial metabolic activities (CO2) where initially significantly (a = 0.05) enhanced by the reflood, resulting in roughly equivalent rates as the aerobic respiratory activities (CO2), presumably as a function of the high water column NO3- levels. This study illustrates that the reflood event in the hydrological cycles in a wetland can significantly stimulate the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and microbiological communities in these soils.

AB  - Petroleum biomarkers (hopanes, terpanes and steranes) are frequently assessed in estuarine sediments as tracers of oil input. In order to compare distinct patterns of hydrocarbon accumulation in mudflats, salt marsh and mangrove, sediments from two transects (control and impacted areas) were sampled in Paranagua Bay, SW Atlantic. Concentrations of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and petroleum biomarkers (hopanes, terpanes and steranes) were determined, as well as bulk parameters (TOC, grain size and delta C-13). N-alkanes concentrations were similar between control and impacted sites (respectively, 3.03 +/- 1.20 mu g g(-1) and 4.11 +/- 3.02 mu g g(-1) ) and reflected a high biogenic input. Conversely, PAHs and petroleum biomarker concentrations were three to six times higher in impacted site than the control site (respectively, 60.4 +/- 23.3 ng g(-1) and 22.0 +/- 25.0 ng g(-1) for PAHs and 197.7 +/- 51.8 ng g(-1) and 40.2 +/- 32. ng g(-1), for hopanes). Despite these differences, concentrations were lower than those reported for highly impacted areas worldwide. Diagnostic ratios and hydrocarbon parameters (e.g. total PAHs and total petroleum biomarkers) helped to distinguish human impact in the ecological zones, suggesting different sources and/or levels of weathering, confirmed by ANOVA tests. TOC played a fundamental role to the concentration of hydrocarbons, showing similar distributions along the transects. Petroleum biomarkers could clearly indicate the preferential sites of deposition and assign different levels of anthropic contamination by hydrocarbons, thus providing clear information about the chronic petroleum pollution in coastal sediments.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photochemical production was measured in bulk and size-fractionated surf zone and source waters (Orange County, California, USA). Post-irradiation (60 min: 300 W ozone-free xenon lamp), maximum H2O2 concentrations were similar to 10000 nM (source) and similar to 1500 nM (surf zone). Average initial hydrogen peroxide production rates (HPPR) were higher in bulk source waters (11 +/- 7.0 nM s(-1)) than the surf zone (2.5 +/- 1 nM s(-1)). A linear relationship was observed between non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon and absorbance coefficient (m(-1) (300 nm)). HPPR increased with increasing absorbance coefficient for bulk and size-fractionated source waters, consistent with photochemical production from CDOM. However, HPPR varied significantly (5x) for surf zone samples with the same absorbance coefficients, even though optical properties suggested CDOM from salt marsh source waters dominates the surf zone. To compare samples with varying CDOM levels, apparent quantum yields (Phi) for H2O2 photochemical production were calculated. Source waters showed no significant difference in Phi between bulk, large (>1000 Da (>1 kDa)) and small (<1 kDa) size fractions, suggesting H2O2 production efficiency is homogeneously distributed across CDOM size. However, surf zone waters had significantly higher Phi than source (bulk 0.086 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.034 +/- 0.013; <1 kDa 0.183 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.027 +/- 0.018; >1 kDa 0.151 +/- 0.090 vs. 0.016 +/- 0.009), suggesting additional production from non-CDOM sources. H2O2 photochemical production was significant for intertidal beach sand and senescent kelp (sunlight; similar to 42 nM h(-1) vs. similar to 5 nM h(-1)), on the order of CDOM production rates previously measured in coastal and oceanic waters. This is the first study of H2O2 photochemical production in size-fractionated coastal waters showing significant production from non-CDOM sources in the surf zone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Like many ecosystem functions in marine and terrestrial environments, nutrient processing varies dramatically over small spatial scales, making efforts to apply findings within and across ecosystems challenging. In estuaries, information on the influence of habitat context on sediment nutrient cycling is lacking even though this is an important estuarine function with high societal value. We collected triplicate intact sediment cores from restored oyster reefs located in different habitat contexts (adjacent to salt marshes, seagrass beds and mudflats), as well as salt marshes, seagrass beds and mudflats without reefs (controls). Sediment denitrification and fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were measured under ambient and experimentally elevated water column nitrate levels. Under ambient nitrate, oyster reefs enhanced sediment denitrification by 18-275% over the controls, with highest rates of denitrification in the mudflat context. With experimentally elevated nitrate, the rate of denitrification was higher for oyster reefs compared to the controls in all contexts. This suggests that oyster reefs prime sediments to denitrify nitrate pulses by providing a labile carbon source for denitrifying bacteria. There was a weak positive relationship between oyster density and denitrification under ambient nitrate concentrations and a positive relationship with denitrification that became negative beyond approximate to 2400 individuals m(-2) with elevated nitrate concentrations. The effect of the oyster reef on sediment denitrification was most pronounced in the mudflat context, due to the absence of other structured habitats and higher oyster density, compared to the other two habitat contexts investigated. The consistency of denitrification efficiency across the habitats and lack of difference between habitats with reefs and those without (controls) suggest oyster-mediated denitrification is an effective sink for nitrogen in coastal systems.Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that oyster-mediated denitrification is dependent on the habitat context of the oyster reef, and variation in oyster density and the relative functional redundancy of oyster reefs where other structured habitats exist (e.g. seagrass and salt marshes) may explain this pattern. Efforts to model and predict ecosystem services provided through oyster reef restoration such as the removal of anthropogenically derived nitrogen should incorporate how habitat context influences ecosystem functions.

AB  - Global numerous wetlands are the most productive ecosystem and have high carbon sequestration potential to mitigate increasing CO(2)in the atmosphere. However, few are available on estimating average carbon sequestration rates by global wetlands (Carbon(sq)) at century timescale. In this article, Carbon(sq)data of 473 wetland soil/sediment cores from the literatures were collected in detail by the meta-analysis method. These cores were no more than 300 years old and spanned a latitudinal range from 33.6 degrees S to 69.7 degrees N. Globally, the average Carbon(sq)was 185.2 g/(m(2)center dot yr) regardless of wetland types. Carbon(sq)varied remarkably between wetland types and ranked as an order of salt marsh (247.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > mangrove (229.8 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > freshwater marsh (196.7 g/(m(2)center dot yr)) > peatland (76.9 g/(m(2)center dot yr)). Carbon(sq)was positively related to mean annual temperature (AMT) and annual precipitation (Pre). Nitrogen was the most common and primary factor controlling Carbon(sq)regardless of wetland types.

AB  - Changes in abundance, community structure and activity of archaea were investigated for rice paddy soil under long-term cultivation along a chronosequence that spans 700 years in a coastal area of east China. Topsoil samples were analysed for archaeal abundance and community structures, which were determined with archaeal 16S rRNA and methanogenic mcrA genes. Methane production potential (MPP) was evaluated concurrently with a laboratory anaerobic incubation of treated topsoil samples. Gene abundance of archaea andmethanogenic archaea increased from 6.70 x 10(6) and 1.53 x 10(5) copies g(-1) in marsh to 2.89 x 10(8) and 2.73 x 10(7) copies g(-1) in rice soil cultivated for seven centuries, respectively. Compared with the uncultivated marsh, diversity indices for both archaea and methanogenic archaea increased markedly with rice cultivation. Methanogenic archaeal community structure was dominated by Methanosarcinales and changed to a lesser extent after 100 years. The measured MPP varied over a range from 241.3 to 301.1 mu g CH4 g(-1) for the rice soil, whereas it was 101.3 mu g CH4 g(-1) for the uncultivated marsh soil. Therefore, gene abundance of both archaea and methanogenic archaea appeared to increase with the accumulation of organic matter following long-term rice cultivation. The changes in MPP and community structure, however, were independent of differences in archaeal abundance. This suggests a complex interaction of soil organic matter, archaeal abundance and community structure, which could change the potential methanogenic activity in rice soil with long histories of rice cultivation.

AB  - QuestionsAs biodiversity losses increase due to global change and human-induced habitat destruction, the relationships between plant traits and ecosystem properties can provide a new level of understanding ecosystem complexity. Using a functional response-effect approach, we show that multiple components of the carbon cycle are determined by a few plant traits, which in turn are strongly affected by environmental conditions.
   LocationSalt marshes, northwest Germany.
   MethodsWe explored responses of morphological, chemical and biomass-related plant traits to environmental drivers and examined their effects on carbon cycle properties, i.e. above-ground biomass, above-ground net primary productivity and decomposition. The combined analysis between environmental parameters, functional traits and ecosystem properties used structural equation modelling (SEM).
   ResultsImportant response and effect traits were leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and below-ground dry mass (BDM, responding to groundwater level and salinity) and leaf C:N ratio (responding to inundation frequency). Inundation and salinity led to increased allocation to below-ground biomass and salt stress adaptation in leaves, which translated into increased decomposition rates. Release from these abiotic controls resulted in standing biomass accumulation, which was controlled by LDMC and canopy height as key traits.
   ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the interacting effects of non-consumable environmental factors and soil resources on morphological, chemical and biomass traits, which affected carbon cycle properties. Loss of species from the community has the potential to change the relationships between environment and vegetation-based ecosystem properties and therefore elicit effects on the multifunctionality of the entire and adjacent ecosystems.

AB  - Maritime Antarctica harbors a large number of penguins and seals that provide considerable input of selenium (Se) originating as guano into terrestrial ecosystems. Subsequent Se emissions via biomethylation and volatilization from these sources of Se have not been studied. Here, penguin colony soils (PCS) and adjacent tundra marsh soils (TMS), seal colony soils (SCS) and adjacent tundra soils (STS), and normal upland tundra soils (NTS) were collected in maritime Antarctica. For the first time, Se volatilization and speciation were investigated in these soils through incubation experiments using chemo-trapping method. The Se contents in PCS, SCS, STS and TMS were highly enriched compared with NTS, with organic matter-bound Se accounting for 70%-80%. Laboratory incubations yielded the greatest Se volatilization rates (VRSe) in PCS (0.20 +/- 0.01 mu g kg(-degrees 1) d(-1)), followed by SCS (0.14 +/- 0.01 mu g kg(-1) d(-1)) at low temperature (4 C). Soil frozen-thawing induced 1-4 fold increase in VRSe, and the VRSe continuously increased until the soils fully thawed. The VRSe showed a significant positive correlation (R-2 = 0.96, p < 0.01) with soil temperature. Methylated Se species were dominated by dimethylselenide (DMSe) in PCS and dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) in SCS. Our results imply that the combination of climate warming, frozen-thawing processes, and high-Se inputs from sea animals will significantly increase tundra soil Se volatilization in maritime Antarctica. High VRSe from penguin colony soils, and significantly elevated Se levels in the mosses close to penguin colony, suggest that volatilization of Se from penguin colony soils play an important role in the mobilization and regional biogeochemical cycling of Se in maritime Antarctica.

AB  - Although ecological zonation and succession are critical concepts to ecology and environmental management, little is known about their development in previously invaded ecosystems after ecological restoration. This present study analyzed plant zonation and succession and the maturation of the abiotic environment of restored Spartina maritima marshes compared to unrestored marshes invaded by Spartina densiflora during a period of 126 months in the Odiel Marshes (Southwest Iberian Peninsula). These restored marshes hosted seven native halophyte species, which were growing in three distinct bands parallel to the tidal line with contrasting abiotic and biotic development during their rapid maturation: a S. maritima non-successional monospecific band, a lower successional band characterized by increasing abundance of Sarcocornia perennis and an upper successional band characterized by rising abundance of the hybrid Sarcocornia perennis x fruticosa and Atriplex portulacoides. The restoration of these European marshes using S. maritima modified their sedimentary conditions, and the establishment of the native ecological zonation and the development of the ecological succession was successfully achieved. In contrast to this, in unrestored marshes, invaded by S. densiflora, only four native halophytes could be found, and their maturation was very slow. Most of the halophytes occupied a narrower range along the intertidal gradient in unrestored marshes than in the restored marshes. The invasion by S. densiflora altered the native zonation pattern, but this invasion seemed to have been limited by healthy growth areas of S. maritima at low elevations, and also by healthy growth areas of native Amaranthaceae species, at middle elevations.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are influenced by many factors related with human activity, such as eutrophication, chemical contamination, selective overfishing, bottom trawling and blast fishing. However, various regions have shown at least some changes that were likely to be attributable to recent climate change. Although various works have pointed to repercussions of climate change on ocean processes at physical and biological levels, a few thoughts were highlighted on contaminant pathways in concert with the predicted and confirmed climate changes. Human activities released during the last century a cocktail of contaminants that are stored in soil, coastal sediments and ice. Predicted alterations under climatic changes raise pertinent questions on this topic. Are hazardous substances stored in those compartments released to cycling within the ecosystem under climate changes? To what extent are quantities injected in the ecosystems toxic to marine organisms? Does it affect ecosystem functioning?
   This article reviews relevant aspects of contaminant cycling under climate changes and gives examples of evidences and scenarios. The selected examples are: melting of ice in the Arctic and the already observed increase of trace metals availability in water; temperature increase and the enhanced production of methyl mercury, a potent neurotoxin; prolonged periods of UV radiation and mercury release from soils and air-exposed sediments; sea-level rise and coastal erosion and the release of metals and organic pollutants from salt marshes; heavy rainfall events and abrupt input of historical and present contaminants from agriculture fields, obsolete industrial and urbanised areas.

AB  - Modelling the relationships between soil chemical factors and vegetation in coastal areas provides a significant contribution to understanding the ecology and conservation of these ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin. The present study relates coastal plant communities and soil chemistry using multivariate analysis and generalized additive models (GAMs) in order (a) to determine the relationships between soil factors and plant community occurrence along a coastline-lagoon gradient; (b) to build best models of soil chemical predictors for coastal plant community occurrence. Distance from coastline was the primary driver of changes in plant community composition and soil factors on the Mediterranean coast. Field capacity, pH, CaCO3, NaCl and soil organic matter were the major parameters related to the pattern of vegetation distribution. Along the costaline-lagoon gradient, however, plant community and soil changes agreed for two main sequences of habitats. The first was in the sand dune environment, involving plant communities, the species composition of which varied in response to increasing soil development. The second was near lagoons, where vegetation responded to soil salinity, acting independently of other soil factors. Coastal plant community occurrence was explained by GAMs, using a few soil chemical predictors: pH and CaCO3 were the main predictors for dune communities but only partly explained their occurrence, whereas NaCl was the key factor for salt marsh community occurrence and largely contributed to the model. The results suggest that soil chemical changes can be detected through vegetation distribution, particularly in saline habitats. Thus, habitat-based models could be a useful tool to identify the key factors for different types of vegetation occurrence in coastal habitats. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Respiration in tidal marshes plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, but is little investigated in Asia. In this study, ecosystem respiration in three brackish marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass), Phragmites australis (common reed) and Cyperus malaccensis (shichito matgrass) were examined monthly during 2009 in the subtropical tidal wetland of the Min River estuary of southeast China. Measurements were taken before and after tidal inundation. Soil porewater CO2 concentrations at soil depths of 5 and 10 cm were also measured. Differences in ecosystem respiration before and after tidal inundation stages were statistically indistinguishable in each vegetation type on an annual scale but differed by month. Monthly variation in ecosystem respiration was apparent and overall respiration in P. australis stand had the highest respiration of the vegetation types. Monthly average CO2 concentration in soil porewater did not differ significantly between the two depths. Ecosystem respiration in P. australis and C. malaccensis stands had a significant positive correlation with soil and air temperature, and a significant negative correlation with soil pH in S. alterniflora and C. malaccensis stands. Our results suggested that the brackish marsh ecosystem of subtropical estuary emits CO2 to the atmosphere at relatively higher level, but the emission pattern did not differ before and after tides.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a comparative study on the aerobic decomposition of six salt marsh plant species over a period of 2 yr. In addition to ash-free dry weight (AFDW) determination and elemental analysis (C and N), two analytic methods have been applied to obtain insight into the decomposition dynamics of lignin in the various plant tissues. The analytic methods an (1)cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and(2) direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry (DT-MS).
   AFDW losses could generally be well described by double exponential relations with time. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios increased during the initial stages of decomposition and decreased again afterward. For five of the six plant species, a correlation between initial lignin content and AFDW loss was observed. Decay dynamics of lignin denoted a rapid relative increase during the first weeks of field exposure, followed by stabilizing contents over the next 2 yr. CuO oxidation data indicate the establishment of a stable "lignin endmember" within 1-2 months. DT-MS data, on the contrary, showed continuous modification of the lignin polymer throughout the duration of the experiment.
   Evidence was found for the incorporation of (presumably) microbial N-acetylglucosamine in the complex residue produced upon decomposition. Combination of CuO oxidation and DT-MS data suggested that lignin degradation products became attached to the original macromolecular material and could still be identified as lignin-derived material. The data support a humification mechanism via condensation of small degradation products instead of the selective preservation of certain biomacromolecules (like lignin).

AB  - Nutrient enrichment impacts ecosystems globally. Population history, especially past resource environments, of numerically dominant plant species may affect their responses to subsequent changes in nutrient availability. Eutrophication can also alter plant-microbe interactions via direct effects on associated microbial communities or indirect effects on dominant species' biomass production/allocation as a result of modified plant-soil interactions. We combined a greenhouse common garden and a field reciprocal transplant of a salt marsh foundation species (Spartina alterniflora) within a long-term, whole-ecosystem, nutrient-enrichment study to determine whether enrichment affects plant production and microbial community structure differently depending on plant population history. For the greenhouse portion, we collected 20 S. alterniflora genotypes-10 from an enriched creek that had received elevated nutrient inputs for 10 years and 10 from an unenriched reference creek-and reared them in a common garden for 1 year. For the field portion, we conducted a 2-year, fully crossed reciprocal transplant experiment with two gardens each at the enriched and unenriched sites; we examined the effects of source site (i.e. population history), garden site and plant genotype. After 2 years, plants in enriched gardens had higher above-ground biomass and altered below-ground allocation compared to plants in unenriched gardens. However, performance also depended on plant population history: plants from the enriched site had decreased above-ground and rhizome production compared to plants from the unenriched site, most notably in unenriched gardens. In addition, almost all above- and below-ground traits varied depending on plant genotypic identity. Effects of nutrient enrichment on the associated microbial community were also pronounced. Following 1 year in common garden, microbial community structure varied by plant population history and S. alterniflora genotypic identity. However, at the end of the reciprocal transplant, microbial communities differed primarily between enriched and unenriched gardens. Synthesis. Nutrient enrichment can impact plant foundation species and associated soil microbes in the short term. Most importantly, nutrient enrichment can also have long-lasting effects on plant populations and associated microbial communities that potentially compromise their ability to respond to changing resource conditions in the future.

AB  - Bulk organic VC and C/N ratios from mid-Holocene salt-marsh deposits with sedimentary banding reveal subtle but significant differences between coarse- and fine-grained deposits. These are consistent with findings from seasonally sampled modern silts, and with the interpretation, on physical and palynological grounds, of the fine-grained and coarse-grained components as warm-season and cold-season deposits, respectively. The control is considered to be seasonal variations in the character of the organic matter supplied.

AB  - We conducted a study to determine the trophic pathways leading to juvenile fish in 2 mesohaline tidal marshes bordering Delaware Bay. The relative roles of the major primary producers in supplying energy, ultimately, to the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus were assessed by measuring the stable isotopic compositions of juveniles (21 to 56 mm total length, TL; most of which were young-of-the-year) and those of macrophyte vegetation, phytoplankton, and benthic microalgae at each site. We collected samples of primary producers and F. heteroclitus, the dominant fish species in this and other marshes along the east coast of the USA, in June and August 1997, at 2 study sites (upstream and downstream) within Mad Horse Creek (a Spartina alterniflora-dominated site) and Alloway Creek (a Phragmites australis-dominated site), for a total of 4 study sites. Our results indicate that F. heteroclitus production is based on a mixture of primary producers, but the mixture depends on the relative abundance of macrophytes. In S. alterniflora-dominated marshes, C and S isotope ratios indicate that F. heteroclitus production is supported by S, alterniflora production (ca 39%, presumably via detritus), while in P. australis-dominated marshes, secondary production is based upon P. australis (73%). To our knowledge, this finding provides the first evidence that P. australis may contribute to aquatic food webs in tidal marshes. Benthic microalgae also contribute to the food chain that leads to F. heteroclitus in both marsh types, while phytoplankton may be of lesser importance. Benthic microalgal biomass was lower in the P, australis-dominated system, consistent with a greater effect of shading in P, australis- versus S. alterniflora-based creek systems. Based on the difference in nitrogen isotope values between F. heteroclitus and the primary producers, the trophic level of F. heteroclitus appears to be similar in the 2 marsh types, despite the differing vegetation types. In summary, the relative roles of the primary producers in supplying energy to F. heteroclitus varies locally and, in particular, with respect to the type of marsh macrophyte vegetation.

AB  - Wetland restoration designs do not frequently consider functional linkages among habitats in the estuarine landscape, nor do they focus sufficient attention on the role of marsh morphology in promoting the efficient exchange of materials and organisms between the intertidal and subtidal water column. These features should be considered, because many marine organisms may benefit from trophic subsidies from adjacent habitats without ever entering them. Stable isotopes were used to examine trophic linkages between primary producers and marine finfishes to highlight the importance of individual life history traits and to punctuate the argument for promoting habitat connectivity (exchange of materials and organisms) in restoration planning. We demonstrate that the trophic spectrum of an estuarine resident, the Moreno americana (white perch), and two marine transients, Anchoa mitchilli (bay anchovy) and Cynoscion regalis (weakfish), are largely functions of locally available organic matter distributed along a gradient of estuarine resources. In both salt marshes and open waters, there was a transition in whole-body isotopic composition in all three species associated with the estuary-wide gradient in nutrient availability ranging from macrophytes and benthic microalgae in marshes, to phytoplankton (as suspended particulate matter) in the open estuary. As anticipated, phytoplankton contributed more to bay anchovy and weakfish biomass, especially in open waters, than to white perch. Our results also suggest that marine transients benefit from the presence of salt marshes without necessarily occupying them. Thus the estuarine "commissary" serves up different recipes in different regions, and the many estuarine-dependent species apparently take full advantage of these varied sources of primary production at the base of the food web when seeking energy for rapid growth and survival.

The highest MARs occurred in the 1950s and 1960s and correspond to record discharge events along the Mobile and Tensaw Rivers. In comparison, MAR at salt marsh sites increased almost threefold over the last 120 years (0.05 to 0.18 g cm(-2) y(-1) or 0.23 to 0.48 cm y(-1)). From 1880 to 1960, organic accumulation remained fairly constant (similar to 20%), while intermittent pulses of high inorganic sedimentation were observed following 1960. The pulses in inorganic sedimentation coincide with several major hurricanes (e.g., Hurricanes Camille, Fredric, Georges, and Ivan). The nearly threefold increase in MAR in salt marshes during the last 120 years would thus appear to be partially dependent on inorganic sedimentation from storm events. This study shows that while hurricanes, floods, and other natural hazards are well-known threats to human infrastructure and coastal ecosystems, these events also transport sediment to marshes that help abate other pressures such as sea-level rise (SLR) and subsidence.

AB  - Salt marshes play an important role in removing excess nitrogen through microbial processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), and one of the major factors known to influence the nitrogen purification capacity of salt marshes worldwide is the invasion of alien species. Previous studies on the effects of invasive plants on nitrogen removal have tended to focus on the upper soils, whereas only a few have sought to examine the effects of exotic species on nitrogen removal in deep soils. This disparity may thus have led to unrepresentative evaluations when attempting to make integrated assessments of the ecosystem services provided by exotic species. Here, using the N-15 tracer technique, we investigated the processes of denitrification and anammox in sediments of four habitat types (bare mudflat and marshlands dominated by the native plant species Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis and the invasive plant Spartina alterniflora) on Chongming Island, located in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Measurements were taken in May and October 2018 from six different depth ranges (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50, and 50-100 cm) within the soil profile. With respect to the entire soil profile, we found that S. alterniflora did not facilitate effective nitrogen removal compared with the native plants S. mariqueter and P. australis. However, S. alterniflora did significantly increase nitrogen removal in the upper 50 cm of soil, whereas a slight reduction in nitrogen removal was observed in the deeper 50-100 cm soil layer. These results indicate that nitrogen removal was significantly increased only in the upper soils subsequent to S. alterniflora invasion, which contributes to our existing knowledge regarding the effects of invasive species on the nitrogen cycle in salt marshes. Furthermore, we established that in the upper soil layers between 0 and 50 cm, denitrification is primarily regulated by NO3- and the C/N ratio, whereas anammox is predominantly regulated by bulk density. Contrastingly, in the deeper soil layers between 50 and 100 cm, both these processes are largely regulated by redox potential and pH. These results serve to highlight that when evaluating the ecosystem services provided by S. alterniflora in salt marshes, it is necessary to estimate nitrogen removal in both the upper and deeper soil layers.

AB  - A field experiment was carried out at three different water levels and four salinity levels to study the effects of water level and salinity on nutrient contents in mash soil of the Yellow River Delta, China. Contents of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils were measured under different water and salinity levels during the study period. Results showed that TN contents gradually decreased with increasing salinities and the highest content appeared in surface soils in different sampling dates. Higher TN contents in August (361.55?mg/kg) and September (412.17?mg/kg) were observed under 0.52 and 16.7% salinity treatments, respectively, and 10?cm water level, and the highest value in October (504.81?mg/kg) was observed under 10.2% salinity treatment and 0?cm water level. TN contents showed significant differences among different water treatments. Similarly, TP content also appeared an accumulation in surface soils in each sampling date. However, significant differences of TP contents in subsurface soils were observed among three water levels. Salinity significantly influenced the changes in TN and TP contents in both soil layers under different water level treatments. Soil TN and TP contents were significantly correlated to soil organic matter.

AB  - Among the solutions being proposed for reversing wetland loss in the Mississippi River Delta are the creation of diversions to reintroduce suspended sediment carried in the river. In areas of rapid relative sea-level rise, as in the Mississippi Delta, it is generally accepted that a supply of sediment in flood water and mineral sedimentation are critical to sustaining wetlands. But plans to create diversions have raised questions about the collateral effects of nutrients carried in the Mississippi River, effects that may contravene the benefits of sediment. This review finds the balance of empirical and theoretical evidence supports that nutrients benefit above- and belowground plant production and that fresh water and sediment diversions can be effective and beneficial for restoring wetlands in the Delta, especially if designed to maximize sediment inputs. The input of sediment, nutrients, and fresh water will change the community composition of some wetlands and their biogeochemical processes. Most of the nitrogen input should be assimilated or denitrified. Labile organic matter is likely to degrade more quickly, but labile organic matter does not add 'new' soil volume and its speed of decay is of little consequence. Additional research is needed before we fully understand the consequences of nutrients on the preservation of organic matter in sediment, but building on what is known of the activities of lignin-degrading fungi and their enzymes, it is likely that refractory organic matter should increase and contribute positively to sediment accretion. This is supported by long-term studies of sediment accretion in a New England salt marsh with peat sediment, and in a mineral-dominated southeastern salt marsh, that show elevations in fertilized plots gained as much or more than in reference plots.

AB  - Humic substances are considered to be a necessary component of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the most persistent part of the decomposing organic matter. In marine environments about 90% of the dissolved carbon, as well as a major part of the sedimentary organic carbon, is humic matter. In the salt marsh estuaries, in addition to the humic matter brought about by rivers, a predominant autochthonous vascular plant Spartina alternifora serves as a source of humic substances. Estuarine humic substances consist of C, N, and O, containing functional groups that can interact with inorganic elements and organic compounds. In this way humic substances apparently affect the bioavailability and toxicity of different pollutants. Although they could be used and structurally transformed by natural assemblages of microorganisms in some way, a considerable part of estuarine humic substances persist, apparently because of their adsorption on mineral components of estuarine sediments such as clay minerals. Due to their specific characteristics, including natural longevity in ecosystems, humic substances represent a natural factor apparently lowering ecological risk in salt marsh estuaries.

AB  - The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and concentration of dissolved CH4 in surface waters have been studied in three coastal systems connected to Cadiz Bay (southwestern coast of Spain) over different time scales. The concentration of CH4 varied from 1 to 4200 nmol kg(-1) (192.1 +/- 463.6 nmol kg(-1)) and the saturation percent from 19 to 159,577% (6645 +/- 16,921%), and pCO(2) from 315 to 3240 mu atm (841.9 +/- 466.3 mu atm), with saturation percent values varying between 72 and 981% (220 +/- 133%). The seasonal variation of pCO(2) mainly depends on the temperature. On the contrary, the annual distribution of dissolved CH4 is associated with the precipitation regime. In addition, pCO(2) and dissolved CH4 showed spatial variation. pCO(2) increased toward the inner part of the systems, with the proximity to the discharge points from human activities. Dissolved CH4 is influenced by both anthropogenic inputs and natural processes such as benthic supply and exchange with the adjacent salt marshes. pCO(2) and dissolved CH4 also varied with the tides: The highest concentrations were measured during the ebb, which suggests that the systems export CO2 and CH4 to the Bay and adjacent Atlantic Ocean.

AB  - Terrestrial inputs largely govern nutrient delivery to the coastal ocean, and subsequent processes transform these nutrients in the land-ocean transition zone. Here, we describe spatial and temporal patterns in surface water chemistry from the Duplin, a salt marsh/tidal creek system located in coastal Georgia, USA. Key drivers of nutrient concentration patterns in the Duplin include discharge from the nearby Altamaha River, groundwater inputs, exchange with the marsh platform, and biological processes within the tidal creek. Altamaha River discharge is correlated with salinity in the Duplin, but the processes taking place within the Duplin watershed regulate the distribution of other dissolved and particulate materials. Long-term data sets advance our understanding of the relative importance of these processes in generating the observed patterns in surface water chemistry. This knowledge improves our ability to predict how coastal systems will respond to anthropogenic perturbations.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the relationship between cellulase activity and habitat segregation for two dotillid crabs - Scopimera globosa and Ilyoplax pusilla - on the marsh-dominated Tanakagawa tidal flat in central Japan. Both species are deposit feeders, and represent the dominant crab species in the study area. S. globosa was found to occur within sandy sediment habitats on the tidal flat, while I. pusilla occurred in both muddy sediment on the tidal flat and salt marsh habitats. This study was the first to detect cellulase activity in dotillid crabs. Cellulase activity was detected for both species; I. pusilla was found to exhibit significantly higher activity than S. globosa. Organic matter content, which is known to have a strong positive correlation with the cellulose content of sediments in estuarine areas, was higher in the sediments of muddy and salt marsh habitats compared with those in sandy habitats. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the habitat segregation of these two crabs and their cellulase activity. Given that cellulose is abundant in refractory organic materials and is a major component of food resources in tidal flat sediments, it is likely that these two crab species, especially I. pusilla, would play an important role in material cycling in tidal flat and estuarine areas.

AB  - One of the main effects of urbanization on coastal areas is through the discharge of sewage, which increases nutrient concentrations in the receiving environment. Salt marshes, like other coastal marine environments, are limited by nutrients, mainly nitrogen, and thus increasing nutrient loadings to a marsh may have consequences on marsh characteristics. We evaluated how the effects of nutrient enrichment in the form of sewage input, affected the vegetation structure and bird assemblages in a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh system near Bahia Blanca, Argentina (39 degrees 01' S - 56 degrees 25' W). Surveys of nutrient concentration, vegetation and birds were made at three different distances from the sewage discharge source. The concentration of ammonium, phosphate, and nitrate and the percent organic matter was higher in marshes nearest to the sewage discharge source. Bird composition and abundance, and vegetation physiognomy changed along a gradient of nutrient concentration. The increased habitat complexity found near the areas of higher nutrient concentration was exploited by birds that use neighboring interior and coastal habitats, including Spartina densiflora marshes, freshwater marshes and upland shrubby habitats. Our results show that local increases of nutrient inputs directly changed the vegetation physiognomy, and indirectly the composition and abundance of bird assemblages. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To gain a better understanding of the chemical structural composition and reactivity of sedimentary organic matter in coastal environments, the properties of sedimentary humic substances (HSs) isolated from contrasting coastal marine environments (i.e., salt marsh estuary, continental shelf, and continental slope) in China were investigated and compared. The complementary analytical approaches employed included elemental analysis, cross polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS)-C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and potentiometric titrations. The results indicate that HSs isolated from the salt marsh site in the Changjiang Estuary, which is strongly influenced by terrestrial river inputs, had the highest content of lignin-derived components, such as phenols and alkyl phenols, and acidic functional groups; HSs from the continental slope site in the South China Sea, which mainly originated from the inputs of marine algae and planktons, contained the highest level of aliphatic compounds, carbohydrates, and nitrogen-containing compounds; however, HSs from the continental shelf site in the East China Sea presented a mixture of both land and marine properties due to the influence of the two sources. Humic acids were found to contain comparatively more highly branched, long-chain aliphatic components but fewer oxygen-containing functional groups, such as carboxyl groups, and fewer sulfur-containing compounds than their fulvic acid counterparts. The total concentrations of proton binding sites and the structural characteristics of the studied HSs may provide insights into the migration and fate of HS-bound contaminants, such as heavy metals and organic pollutants, in coastal marine systems.

AB  - The talitrid amphipod Uhlorchestia spartinophila lives in close association with standing-dead leaves of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora Loisel in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast of North America. This study probed the strength of the trophic link between the amphipod population and the decomposition process in this detrital-based ecosystem. We measured survival, growth and reproductive output in groups of amphipods reared for 6 wk on five diets derived from sheath and blade portions of S. alterniflora leaves just prior to (senescent) and during (dead) decomposition. In unfed treatments, the daily specific mortality rate was 0.391 and starved amphipods survived no longer than lid. Among the fed treatments, a diet of senescent sheaths resulted in the lowest survival (20%) and yielded no offspring. Groups fed senescent blades, dead sheaths, dead blades and unwashed dead sheaths had survival rates of 56 to 84% and produced 5.0 to 12.5 offspring replicate(-1). Sex ratio usually favored females, but approached unity in treatments with high overall survival, suggesting that quality of available food resources may influence sex ratio in this species. Mean specific growth rates (mm mm(-1) d(-1)) ranged from 0.013 to 0.016, and matched previous estimates of growth from field populations. Overall ecological performance (survival + growth + reproduction) was similar for all food treatments, except senescent sheaths, which yielded a final mean (+/- SD) dry biomass (0.4 +/- 0.42 mg replicate(-1)) of amphipods significantly lower than that of other diets (1.7 +/- 0.81 to 2.6 +/- 0.69 mg replicate(-1)). Natural diets derived from decomposing cordgrass leaves can fulfill the nutritional requirements of U. spartinophila populations, but variation in initial amounts of living fungal biomass among the five experimental diets only partially explained the responses of amphipods in our experiment. Structural characteristics and variation in rates of fungal occupation within different portions of cordgrass leaves may affect the amphipod's ability to access plant production made available by decomposers.

AB  - A multiproxy approach based on benthic foraminifera, sediment grain-size, total organic carbon content, major and trace element concentrations, and radionuclide activities was used to investigate the recent landscape evolution of the Canche Estuary (eastern English Channel, France). In the present study the radiometric dating based on Pb-210 and Cs-132 activities could only establish that the sediments were deposited recently. As an alternative method, aerial historical pictures were used for the first time to date core sediments as well as to enhance the palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In approximately one hundred years, an initial naked tidal flat has been gradually replaced by a vegetated salt marsh. In the bottom part of the core, foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Cribroelphium excavation and Elphidium margaritaceum. Haynesina germanica is the most abundant taxon in the middle part of the core while Entzia macrescens is dominant in the upper part. The sediment core represents a typical fining-upward succession in a low-impacted tide-dominated estuary filled by progradation. Our outcomes highlight how a multidisciplinary approach based on abiotic and biotic parameters is essential for understanding complex transitional areas like estuaries. When dating is not provided by classic radiometric methods, historical pictures (< 100 years) may constitute a valuable alternative method to reconstruct recent environments.

AB  - In situ benthic flux measurements, pore water nutrient profiles, water column nutrient distributions, sediment grain size distributions and side-scan sonar observations suggest that advective transport of pore waters may be a major input pathway of nutrients into the Satilla River Estuary (coastal Georgia, USA). In situ benthic chamber incubations demonstrate the occurrence of highly variable, but occasionally very large sea floor fluxes of silicate, phosphate, and ammonium. Locally occurring benthic microbial mineralization of organic matter, as estimated by S-35-sulphate reduction rate measurements, is insufficient to support these large fluxes. We hypothesize that the observed interlayering of permeable, sandy sediments with fine-grained, organic-rich sediments in the estuary provides conduits for advective transport of pore water constituents out of the sediments. Because permeable layers may extend significant distances beneath the salt marsh, the large fluxes observed may be supported by remineralization occurring over large areas adjacent to the estuary. Advective transport may be induced by pressure gradients generated by a variety of processes, including landward recharge by meteoric or rain waters if sand layers extend far enough into the maritime coastal lands. Alternatively, tidal variations across the salt marsh sediment surface may hydraulically pump water through the sediment system. Because these fluxes appear to be concentrated into small layers, this source may be a significant input of nutrients to the estuary even if permeable, sandy layers comprise a very small proportion of the seabed.

AB  - Sources and sinks of organic carbon for San Francisco Bay (California, USA) were estimated for 1980. Sources for the southern reach were dominated by phytoplankton and benthic microalgal production. River loading of organic matter was an additional important factor in the northern reach. Tidal marsh export and point sources played a secondary role. Autochthonous production in San Francisco Bay appears to be less than the mean for temperate-zone estuaries, primarily because turbidity limits microalgal production and the development of seagrass beds. Exchange between the Bay and Pacific Ocean plays an unknown but potentially important role in the organic carbon balance. Interannual variability in the organic carbon supply was assessed for Suisun Bay, a northern reach subembayment that provides habitat for important fish species (delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus and larval striped bass Morone saxatilus). The total supply fluctuated by an order of magnitude; depending on the year, either autochthonous sources (phytoplankton production) or allochthonous sources (riverine loading) could be dominant. The primary cause of the year-to-year change was variability of freshwater inflows from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and its magnitude was much larger than long-term changes arising from marsh destruction and point source decreases. Although interannual variability of the total organic carbon supply could not be assessed for the southern reach, year-to-year changes in phytoplankton production were much smaller than in Suisun Bay, reflecting a relative lack of river influence.

AB  - In this chapter, the nature and scale of nitrogen inputs to the coastal zone from nitrogen fixation, rivers and groundwater, atmosphere, and offshore exchange are presented. The removal mechanisms for nitrogen within the coastal zone are described including fishing, burial, and biological removal, particularly via denitrification and anammox. Budgets for selected coastal systems are presented. The significance of intertidal areas, particularly salt marshes and mangroves, is also discussed along with global change pressures on the coastal zone.

AB  - Amendments of sediment from dredging activities have played an important role in raising the elevation of sinking coastal wetlands. This study compared the soil characteristics of sediment-amended coastal swamps in the Barataria Preserve unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve with natural swamps along Bayou des Familles. The sandy sediment amendments used in the coastal forests had different soil texture and characteristics than the more organic soils of the natural swamps. Three years after the application of these sediments on the sediment-amended swamps, dewatering and compaction of the sediment had occurred but the sediment still had high salinity and bulk density, and low organic matter content. The two sediment-amended swamps differed from each other in that Site 1 had a higher elevation (mean=25 cm higher) and drier soil than Site 2. The effects of sediment in coastal forested wetlands require separate consideration from studies of salt marshes, e. g., the weight of the sediment might damage tree roots, or the amendments might influence soil stability during storms in a different way. Generally, this study suggests that shallower depths of sediment are more likely to yield environments beneficial to these sinking baldcypress swamps in coastal Louisiana.

AB  - Wetland hydrology can greatly influence the variations in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. Soil cores were sampled to a depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals above 20 cm soils and 20 cm intervals below 20 cm soils in river marginal wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanently flooded, one-year, five-year, ten-year, and one-hundred-year floodplains) in 1999 and 2009, respectively. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were measured to investigate spatial and temporal variations in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in five floodplains with different flooding frequencies on a small scale. The results showed that SOCS ranged from 4.62 kg C/m(2) to 13.21 kg C/m(2) and TNS from 0.41 kg N/m(2) to 2.01 kg N/m(2) in the top lm depth in five zones in both sampling years. Higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks were observed in these floodplain wetlands with higher flooding frequencies (i.e. permanently flooded, one-year, and five-year floodplains) than those in lower-flooding-frequency floodplains (i.e., ten-year and one-hundred floodplains), and the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top 10 cm appeared in one-year floodplain rather than permanently flooded floodplain in both years. This indicated that higher flooding frequencies could contribute to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation due to better hydrological conditions compared with lower flooding frequencies. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen stocks in top lm depth decreased by approximately 8-53% and by 22-55% from 1999 to 2009, respectively, of which the highest change rate occurred in one-hundred fooldplain and the lowest in permanently flooded floodplain. The decline in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks of deeper soils mainly caused by heavy alkalinity, reduced water table, and elevated temperature in a ten-year period possibly contribute to explaining the total carbon and nitrogen losses in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that soil organic carbon and total nitrogen levels in this region were significantly correlated with flooding frequencies, soil depth, soil pH value, bulk density, soil texture, and microbial biomass. It is necessary to pay much more attention to carbon and nitrogen stocks in deeper soils and find out the key factors that cause carbon and nitrogen loss in these floodplain wetlands to improve carbon sink function of wetland soils. The findings of this work provide a potential explanation for the "missing" carbon sinks at a larger scale.

AB  - Technologies which utilize semiochemicals, traps/targets and mass trapping are relatively new for management of adult mosquito populations. To date most of the emphasis has been on developing barriers of attractant-baited and insecticide-impregnated targets. The most successful continuous use of this type of technology has been at Stevens' Landing, Collier County, FL. Recently, commercially available traps have been evaluated for their ability to reduce nuisance populations of mosquitoes. Use of Mosquito Magnet (TM) Pro traps along a nature trail on an isolated island (Atsena Otie) in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a significant reduction in annoyance caused by the black salt marsh mosquito Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann). This chapter presents a brief discussion of semiochemicals (behavior modifying) and mosquito traps, strategies for using them for insect control, and an overview of the recent advancements in research activities conducted to evaluate using combinations of serniochemicals and mass trapping techniques for adult mosquito management.

AB  - Depth distributions of thiosulfate (S2O32-) and sulfite (SO32-) were measured in the porewaters of a Danish salt marsh and subtidal marine sediments by HPLC analysis after derivatization with DTNP [2,2'-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine)]. The distributions were compared to the redox zonation as indicated by Eh and Mn2+, Fe2+, and H2S distributions. Concentrations Of S2O32- varied from below detection (<50 nM) to 600 nM while SO32- concentrations generally were 2-3 times higher, 100-1500 nM. Depth distributions of the two species were roughly similar. Lowest concentrations were found in the oxidized zone, including both the oxic surface layer and the suboxic zone of intense manganese and iron reduction, and concentrations tended to increase through the suboxic and into the reduced, sulfidic zone. The similarity of SO32- and S2O32- profiles suggested a close coupling of the cycling of the two species. Rates of consumption were suggested as the main factor governing their distribution. Rapid turnover times for S2O32- and H2S of 4 and 1. 1 h, respectively, were estimated for the upper 0-1 cm of a subtidal sediment.

AB  - Aim Elevated inputs of biologically reactive nitrogen (N) are considered to be one of the most substantial threats to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Several attempts have been made to scrutinize the factors driving species loss following excess N input, but generalizations across sites or vegetation types cannot yet be made. Here we focus on the relative importance of the vegetation type, the local environment (climate, soil pH, wet deposition load) and the experimentally applied (cumulative) N dose on the response of the vegetation to N addition.
   Location Mainly North America and Europe.
   Methods We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of in situ N addition experiments in different vegetation types, focusing on the response of biomass and species richness.
   Results Whereas the biomass of grasslands and salt marshes significantly increased with N fertilization, forest understorey vegetation, heathlands, freshwater wetlands and bogs did not show any significant response. Graminoids significantly increased in biomass following N addition, whereas bryophytes significantly lost biomass; shrubs, forbs and lichens did not significantly respond. The yearly N fertilization dose significantly influenced the biomass response of grassland and salt marshes, while for the other vegetation types none of the collected predictor variables were of significant influence. Species richness significantly decreased with N addition in grasslands and heathlands [Correction added on 23 March 2011, after first online publication: 'across all vegetation types' changed to 'in grasslands and heathlands']. The relative change in species richness following N addition was significantly driven by the cumulative N dose.
   Main conclusions The decline in species richness with cumulative N input follows a negative exponential pathway. Species loss occurs faster at low levels of cumulative N input or at the beginning of the addition, followed by an increasingly slower species loss at higher cumulative N inputs. These findings lead us to stress the importance of including the cumulative effect of N additions in calculations of critical load values.

AB  - The growth response of Dutch salt marsh species (C3 and C4) to atmospheric CO2 enrichment was investigated. Tillers of the C3 species Elymus athericus were grown in combinations of 380 and 720 mul l-1 CO2 and low (0) and high (300 mM NaCl) soil salinity. CO2 enrichment increased dry matter production and leaf area development while both parameters were reduced at high salinity. The relative growth response to CO2 enrichment was higher under saline conditions. Growth increase at elevated CO2 was higher after 34 than 71 days. A lower response to CO2 enrichment after 71 days was associated with a decreased specific leaf area (SLA). In two other experiments the effect of CO2 (380 and 720 mul l-1) on growth of the C4 species Spartina anglica was studied. In the first experiment total plant dry weight was reduced by 20% at elevated CO2. SLA also decreased at high CO2. The effect of elevated CO2 was also studied in combination with soil salinity (50 and 400 mM NaCl) and flooding. Again plant weight was reduced (10%) at elevated CO2, except under the combined treatment high salinity/non-flooded. But these effects were not significant. High salinity reduced total plant weight while flooding had no effect. Causes of the salinity-dependent effect of CO2 enrichment on growth and consequences of elevated CO2 for competition between C3 and C4 species are discussed.

AB  - Coastal marsh lagoons are of high ecological relevance playing a key role in the carbon cycle but are threatened to disappear due to global change effects. Restoration practices can counteract this process. This study compares the microbial heterotrophic functioning in three "new" man-made lagoons (created in 2016) to that in three "old" lagoons (two natural plus one created in 2002) from a Mediterranean coastal marsh. The activity of a range of microbial extracellular enzymes, the functional diversity, and the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, together with microbial biomass and water physic-chemistry were analysed seasonally in the water column of the six lagoons during 2017. Seasonality was a key driver for the lagoons microbial functioning mainly characterized by lowest microbial activities in winter when DOM was highly aromatic after storm events and an increase in organic matter degradation capabilities from winter to summer probably due to a rise in temperature and DOM input from primary production. Significant differences among lagoons appeared when they were less connected (summer and autumn), and old lagoons showed a greater utilization of proteinaceous and polysaccharidic compounds than new lagoons probably linked to their greater algal biomass (chlorophyll content), which may be supported by their larger phosphorus content. In autumn, there was also a greater use of allochthonous plant material in the old lagoons (higher XYL, and XYL/GLU ratio) probably related to their greater development of riparian vegetation. The functional diversity was the lowest in autumn when the lagoons showed distinct functional fingerprints and the lagoon created in 2002 was grouped with the new ones and distinguished from the natural ones, suggesting that it did not achieve complete restoration. Results indicate that microbial functional parameters related to organic matter use are a relevant and sensitive tool to study lagoon restoration processes, reflecting whole ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling.

AB  - The semiochemicals carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol (octenol) were evaluated as attractants at several release rates, alone and in combination, for the major coastal species of biting midges in Georgia: Culicoides furens, C. hollensis and C. melleus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). The data show that CO2 is an effective attractant for the females of all three species, but each has a different response pattern. In contrast, octenol was an effective attractant only for C. furens, either alone or in combination with CO2; octenol had a repellent effect on the other two species. The combination of octenol and CO2 had a synergistic effect on the collections of C. furens.

AB  - The balance between organic matter production and decay determines how fast coastal wetlands accumulate soil organic matter. Despite the importance of soil organic matter accumulation rates in influencing marsh elevation and resistance to sea-level rise, relatively little is known about how decomposition rates will respond to sea-level rise. Here, we estimate the sensitivity of decomposition to flooding by measuring rates of decay in 87 bags filled with milled sedge peat, including soil organic matter, roots and rhizomes. Experiments were located in field-based mesocosms along 3 mesohaline tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Mesocosm elevations were manipulated to influence the duration of tidal inundation. Although we found no significant influence of inundation on decay rate when bags from all study sites were analyzed together, decay rates at two of the sites increased with greater flooding. These findings suggest that flooding may enhance organic matter decay rates even in water-logged soils, but that the overall influence of flooding is minor. Our experiments suggest that sea-level rise will not accelerate rates of peat accumulation by slowing the rate of soil organic matter decay. Consequently, marshes will require enhanced organic matter productivity or mineral sediment deposition to survive accelerating sea-level rise.

AB  - Accelerating sea-level rise poses a threat to mangroves and salt marshes. Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground root production is proposed to increase soil elevation enabling these intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level. However, shallow soil subsidence is frequently observed, which may cancel out or even outweigh the positive effects of surface accretion and root production on soil elevation gains. The processes that lead to shallow soil subsidence have not often been investigated. Here, we used computed tomography (CT) imaging to determine the volume of coarse pores in the top 20 cm of 30-cm-deep soil cores collected from mangroves and salt marshes within Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. The four field sites have long-term observations of variation in soil surface elevation gain, surface accretion rate, and shallow subsidence rate using the rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) method. Over our sites, we found that the rates of shallow soil subsidence were positively related to the volume of soil coarse pores and soil clay and silt content rather than to the volume of fine pores or total porosity or other soil properties. In turn, the volume of soil coarse pores was positively related to the volume of animal burrows and root mass. Fine-pore volume and total porosity of soils were negatively associated with soil bulk density, which was in turn negatively related to soil organic matter content. Our results indicate influences of differently sized soil pores in shallow soil subsidence and suggest that animal burrowing may play a role in shallow soil subsidence.

AB  - Coastal wetland loss through marsh edge erosion is a serious problem in Louisiana. The majority of studies on coastal land loss use aerial and satellite photographic analysis while field and site-specific measurements are limited. The aim of this study was to spatially and temporally measure coastal marsh edge erosion and investigate factors responsible for differences in erosion including shoreline orientation, soil physio-chemical properties, and wind speed and duration. A total of 33 transects across six island sites in northern Barataria Basin, Louisiana were established. Transects on shorelines facing different compass directions were measured for erosion for up to 2 years. Soils were analyzed for physiochemical properties including bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Bathymetric surveys were conducted to determine the extent of the erosive bay bottom profile. In addition, C-14 dating of the basal organic matter (1.5-1.6 m) was conducted. Erosion rates ranged from 49.27 to 324.85 cm y(-1) with a mean value of 141.69 +/- 22.45 cm y(-1). As expected, erosion rates were significantly different (p < 0.001) between protected and unprotected sites. The erosion rate was not correlated with wind speed (r = -0.07), weakly correlated with compass direction of shoreline (r = 0.25) and water level (r = 0.25) but strongly correlated with duration of wind (r = 0.60). Erosion rate was negatively correlated (r = -0.45) with bulk density and positively correlated with organic matter content (r = 0.42) of the top 40 cm of the soil. Over time, the marsh is eroded down to a depth of 1.5 m, which correlates to annual loss of 1.82 +/- 0.29 m(3) volume of marsh per meter shoreline length including a loss of organic matter (141.5 +/- 22.55 kg m(-1)) and carbon (63.32 +/- 10.09 kg m(-1)) previously preserved for up to 850 years. As a consequence, annual CO2 emissions for Barataria Basin were estimated to be 1.56 +/- 0.26 million tCO(2)e y(-1). Results can inform coastal managers as to the most vulnerable marshes to target restoration efforts. Due to high relative sea level rise in coastal Louisiana, these results can also be used to inform the world's stable coastlines on the relative vulnerability of their coastal marshes in the near future, due to projected eustatic sea level. Consequently, the eroding coastlines across the globe may be a significant source of CO2 emissions in near future, as millennial age stored soil carbon is released in a relatively short time, potentially overwhelming human efforts to slow rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB  - We report on methane (CH4) concentrations and efflux densities that were measured over a drained and grazed, peatland pasture in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California over a three year period. The site was ideal for micrometeorological flux measurements due to its very flat topography, its exposure to vigorous winds and its extended fetch along the predominant wind direction. Nevertheless, the interpretation of methane fluxes with eddy covariance proved to be extremely complicated by a number of geographical, biophysical, biogeochemical and site management factors.
   Initial inspection of the data revealed unexpected results methane concentrations and efflux densities were greatest during the night rather than during the day. To explain this odd diurnal behavior in methane efflux densities and concentration, we tested two hypotheses. The prime hypothesis presupposed that the stable stratification of the nocturnal boundary layer elongated the flux footprint and enabled the flux tower to sense wetter fields at the western edge of the pasture, flooded drainage ditches, and/or a tidal marsh upwind of the pasture these land forms emitted methane at rates 10-100 times greater than the drained portion of the peatland. And, this methane was emitted into a shallower volume of the atmosphere due to the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer, causing methane concentrations to rise faster. The alternative hypothesis attributed the higher nocturnal methane fluxes to cattle, as they may have congregated near the tower at night.
   We investigated these hypotheses with: (1) a series of micrometeorological field measurements at companion sites upwind and downwind of the pasture; (2) a series of chamber-based flux measurements on the representative land classes; (3) through the lens of a one-dimensional planetary boundary layer (pbl), box model; and (4) via inspection of digital camera images for the presence or absence of cattle. Together, these pieces of data suggest that elevated methane fluxes and concentrations at night were due to the combined correlation between: (1) the collapse of the nocturnal boundary layer; (2) the elongation of the flux and concentration footprints; and (3) the preferential sampling of an elevated methane source, be it the cattle, wet proportions of the field or some combination. On the other hand, our flux measurements were not perturbed by methane emanating from the tidal marsh that was several kilometers upwind of the peatland pasture site. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Relative sea-level changes during the last similar to 2500 years in New Jersey, USA were reconstructed to test if late Holocene sea level was stable or included persistent and distinctive phases of variability. Foraminifera and bulk-sediment delta C-13 values were combined to reconstruct paleomarsh elevation with decimeter precision from sequences of salt-marsh sediment at two sites using a multi-proxy approach. The additional paleoenvironmental information provided by bulk-sediment delta C-13 values reduced vertical uncertainty in the sea-level reconstruction by about one third of that estimated from foraminifera alone using a transfer function. The history of sediment deposition was constrained by a composite chronology. An age-depth model developed for each core enabled reconstruction of sea level with multi-decadal resolution. Following correction for land-level change (1.4 mm/yr), four successive and sustained (multi-centennial) sea-level trends were objectively identified and quantified (95% confidence interval) using error-in-variables change point analysis to account for age and sea-level uncertainties. From at least 500 BC to 250 AD, sea-level fell at 0.11 mm/yr. The second period saw sea-level rise at 0.62 mm/yr from 250 AD to 733 AD. Between 733 AD and 1850 AD, sea level fell at 0.12 mm/yr. The reconstructed rate of sea-level rise since similar to 1850 AD was 3.1 mm/yr and represents the most rapid period of change for at least 2500 years. This trend began between 1830 AD and 1873 AD. Since this change point, reconstructed sea-level rise is in agreement with regional tide-gauge records and exceeds the global average estimate for the 20th century. These positive and negative departures from background rates demonstrate that the late Holocene sea level was not stable in New Jersey. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major processes controlling sedimentological characteristics and accretionary rates and patterns were evaluated in two of the most common tidal marsh settings (estuarine tributaries and estuarine embayments) in Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest microtidal estuaries in the world. Textural analyses of 29 vibracores show spatial and temporal trends in grain size and organic matter which reflect differences in depositional settings within the marshes and changes in the controlling processes, as well as broader events in the surrounding watersheds. Spatially, the surficial sediments normally follow expected patterns, with coarsest sediments and lowest organic matter contents found in bay margin or channel margin locations, while the finest, organic-rich sediments occur in interior and submerged upland marshes. However, temporally, the marshes do not always show the expected increasing dominance of organic input over time (indicated by increasing % loss on ignition with decreasing depth), indicative of the marsh building process. Sea-level rise, tidal channel migrations, and anthropogenic effects likely contribute to decreases in organic matter contents in the upper sediment column. Furthermore, accretion rates and stratigraphic characteristics can be affected by these same processes, illustrating the importance of understanding temporal changes in marsh depositional environments over various time scales before sedimentologic and accretionary patterns are evaluated. Examination of the vibracores reveals that the marsh is composed of a complex stratigraphy with at least four major stratigraphic sequences occurring: (1) emerging or developing marsh sequences characteristic of channel margin and interior marshes; (2) submerging or mineral matter enriched marshes, also characteristic of channel and interior marsh areas; (3) high-energy marsh sequences characteristic of bay margin environments; and (4) submerged upland marsh sequences. The sedimentological properties of the stratigraphic sequences are controlled by overwash processes, tidal channel migrations, duration of tidal flooding, various anthropogenic effects, and sea-level rise. Accretion rates and patterns over the last similar to 200 years, determined from pollen histories, differ between the marshes along the estuarine tributary (Nanticoke River) and those found in the tidal embayment (Monie Bay). Marshes in the upper-estuarine tributary have a larger riverine sediment input, and trapping of the high sediment loads in the upper estuary often yields marsh accretion rates (maximum of 0.74 cm/yr) which are greater than relative sea-level rise (similar to 0.4 cm/yr), resulting in stable marshes. By comparison, estuarine processes limit penetration of high sediment loads to the lower reaches of marshes along the tributary and, as a consequence, accretion rates are generally lower than the rate of relative sea-level rise, and marsh loss is prevalent. Overall, accretion rates in the marshes in the embayment are close to or less than the local sea-level rise and do not have as distinctive spatial patterns as the tributary marshes. Although marsh loss has yet to be identified as a significant: process here, decreases in organic content of the upper sediment column may signal the early stages of submergence due to sea-level rise.

AB  - Light and dark benthic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes and sediment characteristics (total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), TOC isotope ratio (delta C-13), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration, and compound-specific delta C-13) were measured seasonally in a range of habitats in three warm-temperate Australian estuaries to determine what factors control benthic DOC fluxes. Benthic DOC fluxes were seasonal with the highest rates generally observed during summer. Most habitats displayed uptake of DOC during the dark and efflux during the light, and were a net source of DOC to the overlying waters over the diel cycle. Macrophyte habitats (seagrass and macroalgae) had the highest benthic fluxes of DOC (up to similar to 50 mmol C m (2) d (1)). Organic matter supply to the sediment was dominated by in situ production, and both quantity and source exerted control over benthic DOC fluxes. DOC flux was tightly coupled to bacteria and algal PLFA concentrations during summer, and algal PLFA concentrations during winter, indicating a strong influence of microbial interactions on benthic DOC flux and a temperature-related decoupling of algae and bacteria under cooler conditions. Estimates of the global estuarine benthic DOC flux indicate that these areas are a significant source of DOC to the ocean (1-41 Tg C yr(-1)). Inclusion of macrophyte, salt marsh, mangrove, and intertidal benthic DOC flux estimates resulted in a higher global continental margin benthic DOC flux (106-416 Tg C yr(-1)) than the previous estimate (90 Tg C yr(-1)).

AB  - Incubation experiments were adopted to characterize the rates and pathways of iron reduction and the contributions to anaerobic organic matter mineralization in the upper 0-5 cm of sediments along a landscape-scale inundation gradient in tidal marsh sediments in the Min River Estuary, Southeast China. Similar sediment characteristics, single-species vegetation, varied biomass and bioturbation, distinct porewater pH, redox potential, and electrical conductivity values have resulted in a unique ecogeochemical zonation along the inundation gradient. Decreases in solid-phase Fe(III) and increases in nonsulfidic Fe(II) and iron sulfide were observed in a seaward direction. Porewater Fe2+ was only detected in the upland area. High rates of iron reduction were observed in incubation jars, with significant accumulations of nonsulfidic Fe(II), moderate accumulations of iron sulfides, and negligible accumulations of porewater Fe2+. Most of the iron reduction was microbially mediated rather than coupled to reduced sulfides. Microbial iron reduction accounted for 20-89 % of the anaerobic organic matter mineralization along the inundation gradient. The rate and dominance of microbial iron reduction generally decreased in a seaward direction. The contributions of microbial iron reduction to anaerobic organic matter mineralization depended on the concentrations of bioavailable Fe(III), the spatial distribution of which was significantly related to tidal inundation. Our results clearly showed that microbial iron reduction in the upper sediments along the gradient is highly dependent on spatial scales controlled primarily by tidal inundation.

AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of tidal brackish wetlands in urban areas is largely unknown, albeit it is an important ecosystem service. High carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake of estuaries can potentially be achieved by creating conditions that foster CO2 uptake and sequestration. Thus, this study sought to assess NEE in a mesohaline tidal urban wetland that has been restored and determine the biophysical drivers of NEE in order to investigate uptake strength and drivers thereof. Beginning in 2009, NEE was measured using the eddy covariance technique in a restored urban estuarine wetland. Maximum NEE rates observed were -30 mu molm(-2)s(-1) under high light conditions in the summer. Monthly mean NEE showed this ecosystem to be a CO2 source in the winter, but a CO2 sink in summer. Conditional Granger causality showed the influence of net radiation on half daily to biweekly timescales on NEE and the influence of water level at half daily time scales. The overall productivity of this wetland is within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes and it was a sink for atmospheric CO2 in two out of the 3years of this study and had a continued increase over the study period.

AB  - The microbial communities associated with electrodes from underwater fuel cells harvesting electricity from five different aquatic sediments were investigated. Three fuel cells' were constructed with marine, salt-marsh, or freshwater sediments incubated in the laboratory. Fuel cells were also deployed in the field in salt marsh sediments in New Jersey and estuarine sediments in Oregon, USA. All of the sediments produced comparable amounts of power. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences after 37 months of incubation demonstrated that all of the energy-harvesting anodes were highly enriched in microorganisms in the delta-Proteobacteria when compared with control electrodes not connected to a cathode. Geobacteraceae accounted for the majority of delta-Proteobacterial sequences or all of the energy-harvesting anodes, except the one deployed at the Oregon estuarine site. Quantitative PCR analysis of 16S rRNA genes and culturing studies indicated that Geobacteraceae were 100-fold more abundant on the marine-deployed anodes versus controls. Sequences most similar to microorganisms in the family Desulfobulbaceae predominated on the anode deployed in the estuarine sediments, and a significant proportion of the sequences recovered from the freshwater anodes were closely related to the Fe(III)-reducing isolate, Geothrix fermentans. There was also a specific enrichment of microorganisms on energy harvesting cathodes, but the enriched populations varied with the sediment/water source. Thus, future studies designed to help optimize the harvesting of electricity from aquatic sediments or waste organic matter should focus on the electrode interactions of these microorganisms which are most competitive in colonizing anodes and cathodes.

AB  - South Texas has a semi-arid climate with a large interannual variability of freshwater inflows. This study sought to define how changes in freshwater inflow affect the composition, quantity and quality of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) in a South Texas estuary: the Mission-Aransas estuary. The study was implemented 1.5 months after a large rain event in September 2010 and continued for 10 months of drought conditions. The composition of SPOM originating from rivers, the Gulf of Mexico and the estuary were determined using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34). The quantity and quality of SPOM were assessed using organic carbon content, chlorophyll a concentrations and C/chl a ratios. Our results demonstrated that autochthonous phytoplankton was the dominant component of SPOM in the Mission-Aransas estuary during droughts. Benthic organic matter from local primary producers (i.e., seagrass, salt marsh plants, benthic microalgae) did not influence SPOM composition, either as fresh material or as detritus. A comparison with a positive estuary (i.e., Sabine-Neches estuary, TX) indicates that decreases in freshwater inflow may lead to decreases of terrestrial organic matter inputs and to increase the ratio of autochtonous phytoplanktonic material in SPOM.

AB  - To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora on heavy metals pollution of intertidal sediments, sediment cores of a S. alterniflora salt marsh and a mudflat in Bohai Bay, China were analyzed. The results showed that S. alterniflora caused higher total C and P, but lower bulk density and electrical conductivity. The levels of Cd, Cu and Pb were higher in S. alterniflora sediment. Both Cd and Zn were higher than the probable effect level at both sites, indicating their toxicological importance. The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk indexes revealed higher metal contamination in S. alterniflora sediment. Multivariate analysis implied that anthropogenic activities altered mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals. The percentage of mobile heavy metals was higher in S. alterniflora sediment, indicating improvement of conversion from the immobilized fraction to the mobilized fraction. These findings indicate that S. alterniflora may facilitate accumulation of heavy metals and increase their bioavailability and mobility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biogeochemical processes in wetland soils are complex and are driven by a microbiological community that competes for resources and affects the soil chemistry. Depending on the availability of various electron acceptors, the high carbon input to wetland soils can make them important sources of methane production and emissions. There are two significant pathways for methanogenesis : acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. The hydrogenotrophic pathway is dependent on the availability of dissolved hydrogen gas (H-2), and there is significant competition for available H-2. This study presents simultaneous measurements of dissolved methane and H-2 over a 2-year period at three tidal marshes in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Methane reservoirs show a significant correlation with dissolved organic carbon, temperature, and methane emissions, whereas the H-2 concentrations measured with dialysis samplers do not show significant relationships with these field variables. Data presented in this study show that increased dissolved H-2 reservoirs in wetland soils correlate with decreased methane reservoirs, which is consistent with studies that have shown that elevated levels of H-2 inhibit methane production by inhibiting propionate fermentation, resulting in less acetate production and hence decreasing the contribution of acetoclastic methanogenesis to the overall production of methane.

AB  - The results of studies of the content and stocks of organic carbon in the block "litter soil" of pine ecosystems in Zhytomyr and Chernihiv Polissia are presented. The forest ecosystems are important stabilizers of the carbon cycle as well as stocks of carbon. The components of the forest ecosystem are interconnected by the flows of energy and substances. Binding CO2 in the block of "plant-soil", followed by the transformation of carbon into insoluble humus compounds is of particular importance. In the research area sod - light-podzolic and sod-medium-podzolic soils on fluvioglacial sands are mostly spread. These soils belong to the category of old arable ones. Present here are also peat marsh soils. It is shown that the process of humus accumulation is characterized by low intensity, which is caused by a complex of reasons, in particular, the sandy composition of sod-podzolic soils (particle content < 0,01 mm 7,5 %).The thickness of the profile humus portion is 18 cm. The average content of humus is 0,97 %, and reserves 28,3 t/ha in a 20-cm layer. Similar indicators of carbon are 0,56 % and 16,4 t/ha, respectively. Organic substance of sod-podzolic soils of pine habitats is resistant to mineralization and for a long time is removed from the cycle of substances of the pine ecosystem. The average carbon content in hydromorphic organogenic soils increases to 18,1 % and its stocks are 168,9 t/ha. The ability for mineralization peat soils is lower than that of sod-podzolic soils. So, they have a high carbon sequestration capacity. Pine litter reserves on the average are 30-33 t/ha, and carbon reserves on the average are 12,6 t/ha, with its stable content 40 %.The total carbon reserves in the block "litter soil" of a typical pine ecosystem of Polissia are on average 29 t/ha, with the bulk of them being concentrated in the soil. Considering that highly productive pine forests are formed on the infertile soils of Polissia, their afforestation will not only stop the intensive degradation of soils of Ukraine, but also will increase the deposition of greenhouse gases, which will help to prevent further climate change at the regional level.

AB  - Construction of mathematical simulation models helps to organize current information and extend inferences from available data. During the past two decades, microbial ecology has undergone rapid developments in both quantity and quality of available data. In particular, considerable advances have been made in our knowledge of microbial food web dynamics in the Duplin River watershed at Sapelo Island, Georgia. Here we provide examples of how modeling and microbial ecology have interfaced. In the early 1970s, construction of a 14-compartment model of carbon flow through a salt marsh ecosystem aided in directing method development and field experiments on the sediment microbial community. In turn, the results of field experiments corroborated the model's postulated controls on the community. Also, during the past 12 years we have developed a series of simulation models reflecting the growing information on the aquatic microbial food web. Early models provided evidence for the microbial loop but illustrated the paucity of knowledge concerning controls for bacterial growth on detritus. Results from newer methods in microbial ecology and studies from the Duplin River have allowed us to construct a model which provides realistic simulations but is also highly sensitive to certain parameter value changes (e.g., in organic matter availability and grazing by protozoans). Thus improvements in model structure and corroboration of the models with extant data have been closely tied to methodological and conceptual advances in microbial ecology. The relationship is viewed as synergistic, as needs for model parameter values and equation forms have directed further development of methods, experimentation, and field observations.

AB  - 101 samples of wheat grain and soils were taken at locations with marsh soils in the valley of the Elbe river and in areas with waste water irrigation. The contents of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were estimated in grain and in soils after extraction by CaCl2/DTPA (CAD), CaCl2, and NH4NO3 respectively. Included in the evaluation were the contents obtained by extraction with aqua regia, percentage of clay, fine silt, organic matter, and pH values.
   The samples comprised acid and slightly alkaline, sandy and loamy soils. The heavy metal contents extracted by aqua regia were normal or slightly enriched; critical values according to the decree of waste water sludge were not reached.
   Plant available Cu was detectable only by means of the CAD method, and the Zn contents of soils extracted by CAD were closest correlated with plant Zn.
   The NH4NO3 method resulted in the highest correlation between the Ni contents of soils and plants. Pb was only dectable by means of CAD, but the values can not be regarded as plant available.
   Among the methods applied, CaCl2 is the best to predict contamination of wheat with Cd. The double of the critical value of the Federal Health Agency for wheat, 0.2 mg/kg, is reached at a soil content of 0.2 mg/kg, independent from the clay content and the pH value of the soil.
   The CAD method is suitable for a preliminary survey of heavy metal contents of soils. However, to provide evidence of soil contamination it appears necessary to apply the method most suitable for the element in question or plant analyses.

AB  - Eutrophication is now a serious environmental problem worldwide because it disrupts the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems. In the Ebro Delta, intensive rice farming during the 20th century has increased coastal eutrophication and caused ecological and economic impacts. Marsh restoration is as an effective economic and ecological tool to remove nutrients from agricultural runoff, thereby limiting coastal eutrophication impacts and also providing other ecosystem services. The objective of this experimental study was to assess overall N and P concentration reduction, C accumulation and Si buffering in an oligohaline restored marsh receiving nutrient and sediment inputs from river irrigation and rice field drainage waters under different water levels. We established the experimental restored marsh in abandoned deltaic rice fields from August 2009 to June 2012. The study of changes in nutrient concentration was performed in 2010 from June to November. The study of nutrient and carbon accumulation was performed from August 2009 to May 2011. We used two freshwater input type treatments (riverine irrigation and rice field drainage water) and three water level treatments (10, 20 and 30 cm). Our results showed that higher water nutrient concentrations from rice fields caused significantly higher N-NH4+ and P-PO43- concentration reduction (80.76 +/- 1.8% and 17.99 +/- 3.92% respectively). There was also an export in TP and P-PO43- (-45.08 +/- 13.12 and -23.85 +/- 8.15%, respectively) in experimental marsh units receiving river irrigation waters. Significantly lower soil redox conditions and higher total maximum aboveground biomass in the IW treatment were associated with lower N-NO3- concentration reduction and higher Si-SiO2 concentration reduction (94.14 perpendicular to 0.72% and 58.54 perpendicular to 1.08% respectively) than the DW treatment. Higher sediment concentrations from rice fields were associated with higher C accumulation rates (126.10 +/- 6.25 g m(-2)y(-1)) compared with experimental marsh units receiving river irrigation waters (99.44 +/- 8.23 g m(-2)y(-1)). Higher water levels also increased significantly P-PO43- and Si-SiO2 concentration reduction and C accumulation rates within both water type treatments. Our experimental study showed how multiple mechanisms control Nand P concentration reduction, Si buffering and C accumulation. Plant growth may decrease the ability to reduce the input concentration of N-NO3- possibly due to denitrification inhibition via plant oxygenation of marsh soils. Plant uptake may favor Si buffering in the restored marsh, although high water levels may also control Si buffering through higher residence time for diatom uptake. This study indicates that Mediterranean oligohaline restored marshes removed N and P using both river irrigation and rice field drainage waters and also provide C accumulation and Si buffering services. The use of agriculture runoff as a primary source of nutrient and sediment is beneficial for marsh restoration projects focused on C accumulation. In general, higher water levels (20-30 cm) were better for nutrient concentration reduction and C accumulation, but higher water levels were also associated with lower plant biomass.

AB  - The decade-long USA research program on the direct effects of CO2 enrichment on vegetation has achieved important milestones and has produced a number of interesting and exciting findings. Research beginning in 1980 focused on field experiments to determine whether phenomena observed in the laboratory indeed occurred in natural environments. The answer is yes. Data obtained from numerous field studies show mixed response of crop and native species to CO2 enrichment however. Nearly all experiments demonstrate that plants exhibit positive gain when grown at elevated CO2; although the magnitude varies greatly. Most crop responses range from 30 to 50 % increase in yield. Results from long-term experiments with woody species and ecosystems are even more variable. Huge growth responses (100 to nearly 300 % increase relative to controls) are reported from several tree experiments and the salt-marsh ecosystem experiment. Other results from experiments with woody species and the tundra ecosystem suggest little no effect of CO2 on physiology, growth or productivity. Numerous studies of the physiology of the CO2 effect are continuing in attempts to understand controlling mechanisms and to explain the variable growth responses. Particular emphasis needs to be given to physiological measures of interactions involving the CO2 effect and other environmental influences, and to the wide-ranging observations of photosynthesis acclimation to CO2. Prospects for future research are identified.

AB  - Many peatlands in Europe have been subjected to land reclamation and systematic drainage, which have substantially affected nutrient cycles in the soil. This work reviews published studies on microbial processes linked to carbon and nitrogen transformations in the soils of the Ljubljana marsh, a drained peatland positioned close to Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. This region is known for its dramatic diversity of animal and plant life, but below ground it hides diverse bacterial and archaeal communities that are highly responsive to environmental changes and make the Ljubljana marsh soils a good source of N2O and CO2, and a sink for CH4. Methanogenesis is highly restricted in these soils due to competition for electron donors with iron reducers. In addition, methane is efficiently removed by methanotrophs, which are highly active, especially in the soil layers exposed to the changing water table. Denitrification is limited by electron acceptors and in deeper soil layers also by carbon, which becomes more recalcitrant with depth. Nitrification involves bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidisers with ammonia oxidation rates being among the highest in the world. Interestingly, ammonia-oxidising Thaumarchaeota in acidic bog soils thrive only on ammonia released through mineralisation of organic matter and are incapable of oxidising added mineral ammonia. The soils of the Ljubljana marsh are rich in bacterial laccase-like genes, which may encode enzymes involved in lignin degradation and are therefore interesting for bioexploitations. Future challenges involve designing studies that will reveal specific physiological functions of phenol oxidases and other enzymes involved in peat transformations and address relations between microbial diversity, function and ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Since its first detection, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have been proven to be ubiquitous in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, two freshwater marsh wetlands- the Honghe wetland and Qixinghe wetland - in the black soil zone in North-east China were chosen to investigate the AOA community diversity and distribution in wetland soils with different vegetation and depth. In the Honghe wetland, two sampling locations were chosen as the dominant plant transited from Deyeuxia to Carex. In the Qixinghe wetland, one sample location that was dominated by Deyeuxia was chosen. Samples of each location were collected from three different depths, and Illumina MiSeq platform was used to generate the AOA amoA gene archive. The results showed that the AOA amoA genes in the soils of the two wetlands were affiliated with three lineages: Nitrososphaera, Nitrosotalea, and Nitrosopumilus clusters. The different dominant status of these AOA lineages indicated their differences in adapting to acidic habitat, oxygenic/hypoxic alternation, organic matter, and other environmental factors, suggesting high diversity among AOA in marsh soils. The main driver of the AOA community was pH, along with organic carbon and ammonium nitrogen, which also played an important role combined with many other environmental factors.

AB  - A 15-month experiment combining a geochemical survey of Cd, Cu, Zn and Fig with a bioaccumulation study for three filter-feeding bivalve species (oysters, Crassostrea gigas; cockles, Cerastoderma edule; and clams, Ruditapes philippinarum) was conducted in a breeding basin of the Nord Medoc salt marshes connected to the Gironde estuary, which is affected by historic polymetallic pollution. Regular manual surface measurements of temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved O-2 concentration and hourly multiprobe in situ measurements throughout several periods for 6-8 weeks were performed. The geochemical behavior of metals in water, suspended particulate matter and sediment and their ecotoxicological impact on the three bivalve species were evaluated by in situ exposure of juvenile oysters (water column) and adult cockles and clams (sediment surface).
   The physico-chemical parameters reflected seasonal variations and basin management. A distinct daily periodicity (except salinity) indicated intense photosynthesis and respiration. In summer, low dissolved O-2 saturations (similar to 40-50%) occurred in the early morning at 30 cm above the sediment, whereas in depressions, the water column near the sediment surface was suboxic. Cadmium, Zn and Cu concentrations in suspended particulate matter exceeded typical estuarine values and were much higher than the homogeneously distributed concentrations in different depth ranges of the basin sediment. Particles collected in sediment traps showed intermediate metal concentrations close to sediment values. These results suggest trace metal recycling due to reductive dissolution under suboxic conditions at the sediment surface resulting in trace metal release to the water column and adsorption onto suspended particles. Dissolved Cd, Zn and Hg concentrations (e.g. 13-136 ng 1(-1); 0.3-25.1 mug 1(-1) and 0.5-2.0 ng 1(-1), respectively) in the basin corresponded to the concentration range typically observed in the Gironde estuary, except for some maximum values attributed to metal recycling. In contrast, dissolved Cu concentrations (1.08-6.08 mug 1(-1)) were mostly higher than typical estuarine values, probably due to recycled Cu complexation by dissolved organic matter. Growth, bioaccumulation rates and kinetics in the whole soft body of the bivalves were analyzed every 40 days. Although Cd bioaccumulation of oysters was lower in the basin than in the estuary during the same period (27,000 ng g(-1), dry weight and 40,000 ng g(-1), respectively) these values are largely above the new human consumption safety level (5000 ng g(-1), dw; European Community, 2002). For cockles and clams, Cd bioaccumulation was lower, reaching 1400 ng g(-1) and 950 ng g(-1), respectively. Similar results were obtained for Zn and Cu suggesting physiological differences between the species and/or differences in the exposure of the organisms due to physico-chemical conditions and metal distribution between dissolved and particulate phases. In contrast, Hg bioaccumulation was highest for cockles reaching bioconcentration factors of similar to 200,000, which even exceeded that of Cd in oysters (50,000) for the same exposition period. Nevertheless, Hg concentrations remained relatively low in the three bivalve species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many marine environments, a voltage gradient exists across the water-sediment interface resulting from sedimentary microbial activity. Here we show that a fuel cell consisting of an anode embedded in marine sediment and a cathode in overlying seawater can use this voltage gradient to generate electrical power in situ. Fuel cells of this design generated sustained power in a boat basin carved into a salt marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey, and in the Yaquina Bay Estuary near Newport, Oregon. Retrieval and analysis of the Tuckerton fuel cell indicates that power generation results from at least two anode reactions: oxidation of sediment sulfide (a by-product of microbial oxidation of sedimentary organic carbon) and oxidation of sedimentary organic carbon catalyzed by microorganisms colonizing the anode. These results demonstrate in real marine environments a new form of power generation that uses an immense, renewable energy reservoir (sedimentary organic carbon) and has near-immediate application.

AB  - Mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes or collectively known as blue carbon ecosystems are gaining salience because of their essential roles in reducing the risks and impacts of climate change through carbon sequestration and other beneficial services. Despite this, they are globally declining because of their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Similar trends are also observed in Busuanga Island, Palawan province in the Philippines, where blue carbon ecosystems along with other coastal environments are perceived to be threatened by a number of factors. To better understand the state changes of blue carbon ecosystems, we collected the drivers and pressures and their impact on the whole coastal ecosystem as well as existing management responses by interviewing 26 stakeholders representing community organizations, non-government organizations, and municipal level government units from two municipalities (Busuanga and Coron) in the island. We used the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to analyze the information gathered from the interviews. The results of this study show that lack of institutional capacities (indirect driver) is the leading factor that hinders the progress or efficacy of the management. Most pronounced pressures caused by direct drivers to blue carbon ecosystems include overexploitation and coastal developments. The responses collected in the interviews can be grouped into policies and implementation, capacity building development, welfare and livelihood development, ecosystems management, and tourism measures. The information gathered in this study can be used to improve or change existing responses into more precise and contextualized measures in addressing specific impacts observed in the local areas.

AB  - To aid in assessing the functioning of a constructed salt marsh and the adjacent natural marsh, we conducted a one-year study of epibenthic invertebrates using a new sampling method. Invertebrates were trapped in litter bags (5-mm mesh) filled with Spartina foliosa; these were compared with bags containing other substrates (plastic grass, Typha, and Scirpus, all of which trapped fewer individuals than Sparrina-filled bags. A total of 168 Spartina-filled bags trapped 43,531 individuals over 8 sampling dates. Invertebrate abundances differed by season, elevation, cover of Spartina, and marsh type. There were more invertebrates trapped in fall than in winter; there were more in the lower than higher elevation, and in the natural marsh, there were twice as many invertebrates in areas with greater than or equal to 80% cover of Spartina than with less than or equal to 20% cover. The strongest pattern was with marsh type. Natural, fully vegetated marsh had 2-3 times as many individuals as the sparsely-vegetated, 4-year-old constructed marsh. Overall, the most abundant species was a larval dipteran, Pericoma sp., which was up to 9 times more abundant in the natural marsh. An anemone, Diadumene franciscana, was virtually restricted to the natural marsh. However, the more open constructed marsh had significantly more Hemigrapsus oregonensis crabs and more exotic mussels (Musculista senhousia). The invertebrate assemblage in the 4-year-old marsh was not equivalent to that of the natural marsh. Both marshes had 37 species, but species lists were 46% similar for all sites and dates combined, and relative abundances were 67% similar. Coarser sediment, lower organic matter, and sparse vegetative cover were potential causes of significantly lower abundances in the constructed marsh.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a large and complex mixture of compounds with source inputs that differ with location, season, and environmental conditions. Here, we investigated drivers of DOM composition changes in a marsh-dominated estuary off the southeastern United States. Monthly water samples were collected at a riverine and estuarine site from September 2015 to September 2016, and bulk, optical, and molecular analyses were conducted on samples before and after dark incubations. Results showed that river discharge was the primary driver changing the DOM composition at the mouth of the Altamaha River. For discharge higher than similar to 150 m(3)/s, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the terrigenous character of the DOM increased approximately linearly with river flow. For low discharge conditions, a clear signature of salt marsh-derived compounds was observed in the river. At the head of Sapelo Sound, changes in DOM composition were primarily driven by river discharge and possibly by summer algae blooms. Microbial consumption of DOC was larger during periods of high discharge at both sites, potentially due to the higher mobilization and influx of fresh material to the system. The Georgia coast was hit by Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, which resulted in a large input of carbon to the estuary. The DOC concentration was similar to 2 times higher and DOM composition was more aromatic with a stronger terrigenous signature compared to the seasonal maximum observed earlier in the year during peak river discharge conditions. This suggests that extreme events notably impact DOM quantity and quality in estuarine regions.
   Plain Language Summary Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial component of aquatic ecosystems and characterizing how its composition and concentration change is important to better understand the carbon cycle. Composition and quantity of DOM can vary spatially and temporally due to a variety of factors, including biological activity, precipitation patterns, and proximity to source inputs such as rivers, salt marshes, and the open ocean. To track these changes, monthly water samples were collected and analyzed over the course of a year in a marsh-dominated estuary off the Georgia coast, USA. River flow was shown to be an important factor controlling the amount and type of DOM present at both riverine (Altamaha River) and estuarine (Sapelo Sound) locations. In months with high river flow, organic matter contents were higher and had more terrestrially derived compounds compared to months with low river flow. Additionally, Hurricane Matthew was shown to significantly alter the organic matter at Sapelo Sound, suggesting that extreme events greatly impact DOM quantity and quality in estuarine regions.

AB  - Understanding the processes that control deep soil carbon (C) dynamics and accumulation is of key importance, given the relevance of soil organic matter (SOM) as a vast C pool and climate change buffer. Methodological constraints of measuring SOM decomposition in the field prevent the addressing of real-time rhizosphere effects that regulate nutrient cycling and SOM decomposition. An invasive lineage of Phragmites australis roots deeper than native vegetation (Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens) in coastal marshes of North America and has potential to dramatically alter C cycling and accumulation in these ecosystems. To evaluate the effect of deep rooting on SOM decomposition we designed a mesocosm experiment that differentiates between plant-derived, surface SOM-derived (0-40 cm, active root zone of native marsh vegetation), and deep SOM-derived mineralization (40-80 cm, below active root zone of native vegetation). We found invasive P. australis allocated the highest proportion of roots in deeper soils, differing significantly from the native vegetation in root : shoot ratio and belowground biomass allocation. About half of the CO2 produced came from plant tissue mineralization in invasive and native communities; the rest of the CO2 was produced from SOM mineralization (priming). Under P. australis, 35% of the CO2 was produced from deep SOM priming and 9% from surface SOM. In the native community, 9% was produced from deep SOM priming and 44% from surface SOM. SOM priming in the native community was proportional to belowground biomass, while P. australis showed much higher priming with less belowground biomass. If P. australis deep rooting favors the decomposition of deep-buried SOM accumulated under native vegetation, P. australis invasion into a wetland could fundamentally change SOM dynamics and lead to the loss of the C pool that was previously sequestered at depth under the native vegetation, thereby altering the function of a wetland as a long-term C sink.

AB  - Wetland sediments undergo dry-wet cycles that may change their structural properties and affect geochemical behavior of associated organic compounds. In this study, we examined the effect of drying on particle size distributions and the rapid (24 h) sorption reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with salt marsh sediments in Nueces Delta, South Texas. Drying reduced the fraction of fine particles in organically richer sediments, indicating structural rearrangement of organic matter and mineral aggregates. Among the 16 EPA priority PAHs examined, dried sediment preferentially released 1.0-7.5% of phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene to added seawater (solid: water mass ratio of 1/100)- significantly greater than release from sediments maintained in the wet state. On the other hand, drying also increased the affinity of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) for experimentally amended (deuterated) phenanthrene relative to continually wet sediments. Further, deuterated phenanthrene was even more effectively retained when it was added to wet sediment that was subsequently dried and rewetted.These apparently contradictory results can be reconciled and explained by SOM having a heterogeneous distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic zones - e.g., a zonal model. We propose that drying changed the orientation of amphiphilic SOM, exposing hydrophobic zones and promoting the release of some of theft native PAHs to water. Freshly amended PAHs were only able to penetrate into the surface hydrophobic zone and/or deeper but rapidly accessible ("kinetics") zone in wet sediments clue to the brief adsorption contact time. Subsequent drying presumably then induced structural changes in SOM that isolated these amended PAHs in sites inaccessible to water exchange in the next rewetting. These results provide insights into structural changes of SOM upon drying, and help predict the fate of compounds such as organic contaminants during drought/flood oscillations.

AB  - The effects of plant zonation on polychaete distribution and abundance were studied along an environmental gradient in intertidal flats of Paranagua Bay (SE Brazil). Two polychaete stocks with marked preference for specific haline regimes were recognized with a low degree of spatial overlap in species distribution. Species richness and abundance were lower in the mesohaline sector, characterized by fine sediments and high organic carbon content, than in the high-energy euhaline sector, dominated by moderately sorted fine sands low in organic carbon content. Faunal differences were primarily defined by salinity and environmental energy gradients and only secondarily by the ability of polychaetes to discriminate among unvegetated, salt marsh or mangrove swamp habitats.

AB  - Sediment samples from a salt marsh habitat in the vicinity of Linden Chemical Plant (LCP) Superfund site in Brunswick Georgia, USA, were analyzed for the composition of total solvent extracts and sources of lipid compounds. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis infer past multiple sources of organic matter (OM) from aquatic and terrestrial origin, e.g., phytoplankton, bacteria, and land plants, as well as anthropogenic contamination. The n-alkane and n-alkanol distributions in the sediment samples were dominated by long-chain homologues maximizing at C-25-C-27 for alkanes (carbon preference index (CPI) similar to 1) and C-32 for nalkanols indicating inputs from higher plants, but also microbial and petroleum-related sources. Fatty acid distribution was characterized by short-chain (< C-18) and branched homologues indicative of bacterial origin. The high abundance of dehydroabietic acid and anthropogenic contaminants, including alkylphenols, are indicative of the effects of past industrial activities in the LCP marsh area in Brunswick, Georgia.

AB  - Owing to the large basin area of the Caspian Sea, fluctuations in its level reflect climatic changes in the northern hemisphere. To reconstruct these fluctuations, I collected mollusk shells, plant debris, carbonates and organic matter samples for C-14 dating from deposits of ancient salt marshes, depressions and bars formed during significant sea-level decline. I studied the impact of eolian sedimentation via parallel dating of carbonates and other materials. The data demonstrate that sea level rises during periods of cooling and falls during warming periods; this is true for both long-term (2-2.5 ka) and short-term climatic changes.

AB  - Humic and fulvic acids isolated from salt marsh estuaries of the southeastern United States had copper binding capacities (CuBC) of 0.16 to 0.26 mu g atm Cu2+ mg(-1) humic acid and 0.17 to 0.24 mu g atm Cu2+ mg(-1) fulvic acid. Competitive reactions of humic substances with alkaline earth elements Ca2+' and Mg2+' reduced the CuBC by only 11% for fulvic acids and by 17% for humic acids. Competition with the trivalent metal ions Al3+ and Fe3+ reduced the CuBC in humic substances by 30-40%. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analyses of the humic-metal complexes suggest that Cu(ll) may be bound preferentially by oxygen-containing functional groups in estuarine fulvic acids, but there is a much higher involvement of nitrogen-containing functional groups in binding Cu(II) to estuarine humic acids. FTIR spectra were also collected for humic acid-metal complexes of Ag, Au, Hg, Mn and Pb.

AB  - Twenty-eight surface water samples from rivers, muddy intertidal flats, sand shores, and bedrock coasts were collected along the Zhejiang coastline in southeast China. In addition, three samples from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) were collected for comparison. CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter) absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, as well as nutrients and DOC were measured in these samples. According to salinity, nutrient, and DOC constituents, the 28 Zhejiang samples were categorized into four groups, i.e. highly-polluted, river derived, muddy-flat derived, and saltwater dominated ones. Among the six parameters (two humic-like and two protein-like peak intensities in fluorescence EEM contours, absorption at 300 nm, and DOC concentration) for the Zhejiang samples, any two of them were positively correlated. The submarine groundwater discharge, rather than local rivers, might have provided most of the freshwater that interacted with the saltwater during the mixing process. The high protein-like EEM peaks in samples from muddy salt marshes and rivers were probably caused by terrestrial inputs, land-based pollution, and local biological activities in combination.

AB  - Whether aquatic animals rely primarily for sustenance upon vascular macrophytes or attached algae has been often debated. A compilation of carbon isotope data from the literature for coastal seagrass meadows, estuarine salt marshes, and freshwater lakes and rivers indicates that animal delta(13)C values more closely approximate those of attached algae than they do those of vascular plants. This empirical synthesis supports results from individual studies in suggesting that macrophytes are unlikely to play an exclusive and direct dietary role in aquatic foodwebs.

AB  - Benthic infauna communities were characterized along a chronosequence (1 to 28 yr old) of 7 constructed Spartina alterniflora Loisel marshes and 7 natural (reference) marshes to identify patterns of succession following salt marsh creation. Infauna density and species richness (per 7.07 cm(2) core) achieved equivalence to comparable reference marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Taxa with dispersing larval stages (e.g. Streblospio benedicti, Capitella sp.) achieved equivalence within 3 yr following marsh creation. Taxa that lack a planktonic dispersal stage, such as tubificid oligochaetes and Manayunkia aesturina, were slower to develop. Densities of Manayunkia did not achieve equivalence to natural marshes until 8 yr after marsh creation. Twenty-five yr elapsed before oligochaete densities of constructed marshes were similar to natural marshes. In constructed marshes, densities of surface-deposit feeders, dominated by Streblospio and Manayunkia, achieved equivalence to natural marshes within 8 yr following marsh creation. Subsurface-deposit feeders, consisting mostly of oligochaetes, did not become equivalent to natural marshes for 25 yr. Predictable trajectories, described by an asymptotic increase over time, existed for total species, species richness, and surface- and subsurface-deposit feeders. Oligochaetes and Manayunkia, which produce non-dispersing larvae, exhibited linear trajectories over time. In constructed marshes, total density and density of dominant taxa and trophic groups were strongly correlated with soil characteristics, especially organic C, N, bulk density and macro-organic matter (MOM, the living and dead root and rhizome mat). Non-linear regressions using soil organic C and MOM explained 38 to 40% of the variation in constructed marsh infauna density. The regressions suggest that a threshold of 0.5% soil organic C (500 g m(-2), 0 to 10 cm) and 500 g MOM m(-2) (0 to 10 cm) is needed to support infauna densities comparable to densities found in natural marshes. Taxon richness of constructed marshes was more strongly related to vegetation characteristics, especially macro-organic matter quality (e.g. lignin) than soil characteristics. Development of benthic infauna communities following marsh construction requires longer than the 5 yr monitoring period required by many wetland mitigation plans, and as much as 25 yr are needed for some attributes (e.g. oligochaetes) to achieve equivalence.

AB  - While soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and stabilization has been increasingly the focus of ecosystem properties, how it could be linked to soil biological activity enhancement has been poorly assessed. In this study, topsoil samples were collected from a series of rice soils shifted from salt marshes for 0, 50, 100, 300 and 700 years from a coastal area of eastern China. Soil aggregates were fractioned into different sizes of coarse sand (200-2000 mu m), fine sand (20-200 mu m), silt (2-20 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m), using separation with a low-energy dispersion protocol. Soil properties were determined to investigate niche specialization of different soil particle fractions in response to long-term rice cultivation, including recalcitrant and labile organic carbon, microbial diversity of bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, soil respiration and enzyme activity. The results showed that the mass proportion both of coarse-sand (2000-200 mu m) and clay (< 2 mu m) fractions increased with prolonged rice cultivation, but the aggregate size fractions were dominated by fine-sand (200-20 mu m) and silt (20-2 mu m) fractions across the chronosequence. SOC was highly enriched in coarse-sand fractions (40-60 g kg(-1)) and moderately in clay fractions (20-25 g kg(-1)), but was depleted in silt fractions (similar to 10 g kg(-1)). The recalcitrant carbon pool was higher (33-40% of SOC) in both coarse-sand and clay fractions than in fine-sand and silt fractions (20-29% of SOC). However, the ratio of labile organic carbon (LOC) to SOC showed a weakly decreasing trend with decreasing size of aggregate fractions. Total soil DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) content in the size fractions followed a similar trend to that of SOC. Despite the largely similar diversity between the fractions, 16S ribosomal gene abundance of bacteria and of archaeal were concentrated in both coarse-sand and clay fractions. Being the highest generally in coarse-sand fractions, 18S rRNA gene abundance of fungi decreased sharply but the diversity gently, with decreasing size of the aggregate fractions. The soil respiration quotient (ratio of respired CO2-C to SOC) was the highest in the silt fraction, followed by the fine-sand fraction, but the lowest in coarse-sand and clay fractions in the rice soils cultivated over 100 years, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient was lower in coarse-sandsized fractions than in other fractions. Soil respiration was higher in the silt fraction than in other fractions for the rice soils. For the size fractions other than the clay fraction, enzyme activity was increased with prolonged rice cultivation, whereas soil respiration appeared to have a decreasing trend. Only in the coarse-sand fraction was both microbial gene abundance and enzyme activity well correlated to SOC and LOC content, although the chemical stability and respiratory of SOC were similar between coarse-sand and clay fractions. Thus, biological activity was generally promoted with LOC accumulation in the coarse-sand-sized macroaggregates of the rice soils, positively responding to prolonged rice cultivation management. The finding here provides a mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon turnover and microbial community succession at fine scale of soil aggregates that have evolved along with anthropogenic activity of rice cultivation in the field.

AB  - Spatial and temporal trends in pore water geochemistry and sediment microbial community structure are compared at three intertidal sites of a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA. The sites include a heavily bioturbated, unvegetated creek bank, a levee with dense growth of Spartina alterniflora. and a more sparsely vegetated ponded marsh site. The redox chemistry of the pore waters ranges from sulfide-dominated at the ponded marsh site to suboxic at the creek bank site. At the three sites. the vertical redox stratification of the pore waters is more compressed in summer than in winter. The trends in redox chemistry reflect opposing effects of sediment respiration and pore water irrigation. Intense and deep burrowing activity by fiddler crabs at the creek bank site results in the efficient oxidation of reduced byproducts of microbial metabolism and, hence, the persistence of suboxic conditions to depths of 50 cm below the sediment surface. Increased supply of labile organic substrates at the vegetated sites promotes microbial degradation processes. leading to sharper redox gradients. At the levee site, this is partly offset by the higher density and deeper penetration of roots and macrofaunal burrows. Surprisingly, the microbial community structure shows little correlation with the variable vertical redox zonation of the pore waters across the saltmarsh. At the three sites, the highest population densities of aerobic microorganisms, iron- plus manganese-reducing bacteria, and sulfate reducers coexist within the upper 10 cm of sediment. The absence of a clear vertical separation of these microorganisms is ascribed to the hi It supply of labile organic matter and intense mixing of the topmost sediment via bioturbation.

AB  - The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), CaCO3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features - indicative of reduction-oxidation processes - were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 0.4 to similar to 4 dS m(-1)) and drier (water level > -1.5 m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds (EC 1:5 in the upper layers similar to 2 to similar to 9 dS m(-1) and water level between -1 m depth and +0.2 m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh > + 500 mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic (similar to + 100 mV < Eh < similar to +350 mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh < similar to +100 mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon. However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean. We propose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae could sequester about 173 TgC yr(-1) (with a range of 61-268 TgC yr(-1)) globally. About 90% of this sequestration occurs through export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in angiosperm-based coastal habitats.

AB  - Tropical- and subtropical-storm surges combined with sea level rise cause saltwater intrusions into low-lying coastal ecosystems along the southeastern coast of the United States, gradually converting freshwater forested wetland into saltmarsh. The transition zone between freshwater and saltwater ecosystems becomes a degraded forested wetland, where the combination of high levels of soil organic matter and elevated concentrations of halide ions creates a dynamic biogeochemical environment that may be a potential hotspot for halocarbon formation such as chloroform, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide. This study conducted field measurements at a transition zone in coastal South Carolina to quantify halocarbon exchange rates and laboratory soil incubations to determine the contributions of biotic versus abiotic processes. The degraded forested wetland showed significant chloroform emission rates (146 +/- 129 nmol m(-2) d(-1)). The degraded forested wetland remained a net sink for methyl chloride and a negligible source/sink for methyl bromide, unlike the saltmarsh which was a significant source for both. The laboratory incubations strongly suggest that methyl halide consumption in soils at the field site was biotic and that production of methyl halides and chloroform was largely abiotic and temperature-dependent, although additional experiments are required to rule out possible biotic production involving heat-resistant microbes. The results suggest that sea level rise and more frequent storm surges derived from global climate change, in the long term, may increase emissions of chloroform from coastal degraded forested wetlands and of methyl halides if salt marshes expand, with potential impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion.

AB  - Ria de Aveiro is a very important area of the Portuguese coast, which has been under an increasing anthropogenic pressure, for several decades, contributing to the degradation of the lagoon's water quality.
   A water quality model was applied to predict concentrations of inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. Both data and modelling results point out that the DO distribution in the lagoon is controlled by tidal transport processes. The DO distribution in the Ria de Aveiro seems to be mainly controlled by tidal processes, as its concentration remains relatively high and close to sea values. The far end of the lagoon, where the intertidal salt marshes are important, the DO concentration is dominantly affected by re-aeration and the flooding/drying processes over the intertidal salt marshes, the phytoplankton activity, the nitrification processes and oxidation of the organic matter. These processes play an important role in the creation of the summer hypoxic/anoxic situations, when primary production and advective transport are low. Data and modelling results show strong relationship between nutrients and the CHL-a concentrations during spring-summer, but weak during winter-spring, evidencing the light and nutrients limiting effect during, respectively the last and the former period. High NO3 and NH4 concentrations or important spikes in the concentration precede or coincide, in general, with the CHL-a increase. The main results concerning the DO evolution and distribution demonstrate that a generalized eutrophication state is unlikely to occur within the lagoon, except near its very far end, during summer and in a situation of high BOD concentrations. The good connection between Ria de Aveiro lagoon and the sea and the circulation pattern inside the lagoon are, therefore, responsible for relatively high level of oxygen water content in the water column, throughout its main channels.

AB  - The volatile forms of selenium emitted from soils and plants have been identified by others as dimethylselenide and dimethyldiselenide. Dimethylselenoniopropionate, a possible precursor of dimethylselenide, is the selenium analogue of the common marine osmoprotectant, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Dimethylselenoniopropionate was organically synthesized from dimethylselenide and acrylate and used in a comparative study with dimethylsulfoniopropionate as a growth substrate, an inducer and substrate for dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in two marine bacterial isolates, Alcaligenes sp. strain M3A and Pseudomonas doudoroffii, and in salt marsh sediments and estuarine creek water samples. In P. doudoroffii, the rate of dimethylselenoniopropionate transport into cells was about half that observed with dimethylsulfoniopropionate; Alcaligenes does not take up these molecules. The rate and extent of induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase in P. doudoroffii at low concentrations of dimethylselenoniopropionate were similar to that of dimethylsulfoniopropionate. In Alcaligenes the low constitutive level of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase cleaved dimethylselenoniopropionate into dimethylselenide and acrylate, but induction of dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase by dimethylselenoniopropionate did not follow. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyases from both strains, when induced by dimethylsulfoniopropionate, utilized dimethylselenoniopropionate as a substrate with emission of dimethylselenide. Rates of partially purified dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase activity with dimethylselenoniopropionate were half those with dimethylsulfoniopropionate. Anoxic salt marsh sediments catalyzed dimethylsulfoniopropionate and dimethylselenoniopropionate degradation at equal rates. In sediments containing high organic matter, both dimethylsulfide and dimethylselenide served as substrates for methanogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that organic selenium molecules can be volatilized by the same biochemical pathways as organic sulfur molecules.

AB  - Dendritic tidal creek networks are important habitats for sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in salt marsh wetlands. To evaluate the importance of creek heterogeneity in supporting benthic secondary production, we assess the spatial distribution and secondary production of a representative polychaete species (Dentinephtys glabra) in creek networks along a stream-order gradient in a Yangtze River estuarine marsh. Density, biomass, and secondary production of polychaetes were found to be highest in intermediate order creeks. In high order (3rd and 4th) creeks, the density and biomass of D. glabra were higher in creek edge sites than in creek bottom sites, whereas the reverse was true for low order (1st and 2nd) creeks. Secondary production was highest in 2nd order creeks (559.7 mg AFDM m(-2) year(-1)) and was ca. 2 folds higher than in 1st and 4th order creeks. Top fitting AIC models indicated that the secondary production of D. glabra was mainly associated with geomorphological characters including cross-sectional area and bank slope. This suggests that hydrodynamic forces are essential factors influencing secondary production of macrobenthos in salt marshes. This study emphasizes the importance of microhabitat variability when evaluating secondary production and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Native eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an important contributor to ecosystem services that supplies cover for juvenile fish, supports a variety of invertebrate prey resources for fish and waterbirds, provides substrate for herring roe consumed by numerous fish and birds, helps stabilize sediment, and sequesters organic carbon. Seagrasses are in decline globally, and monitoring changes in their growth and extent is increasingly valuable to determine impacts from large-scale estuarine restoration and inform blue carbon mapping initiatives. Thus, we examined the efficacy of two remote sensing mapping methods with high-resolution (0.5 m pixel size) color near infrared imagery with ground validation to assess change following major tidal marsh restoration. Automated classification of false color aerial imagery and digitized polygons documented a slight decline in eelgrass area directly after restoration followed by an increase two years later. Classification of sparse and low to medium density eelgrass was confounded in areas with algal cover, however large dense patches of eelgrass were well delineated. Automated classification of aerial imagery from unsupervised and supervised methods provided reasonable accuracies of 73% and hand-digitizing polygons from the same imagery yielded similar results. Visual clues for hand digitizing from the high-resolution imagery provided as reliable a map of dense eelgrass extent as automated image classification. We found that automated classification had no advantages over manual digitization particularly because of the limitations of detecting eelgrass with only three bands of imagery and near infrared.

AB  - The anoxic decomposition processes in sediments from a tropical mangrove forest (Bangrong, Thailand) and a salt marsh in the temperate Wadden Sea (Denmark) were compared, and the effects of increased ammonium and/or phosphate concentrations on the anoxic decomposition were studied. Sediment was incubated in jars (20-ml glass vials) and changes in porewater solutes were followed in a time series of 3 weeks. Furthermore, the short-term fate (days) of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) added to Bangrong mangrove sediment was evaluated from phosphorus fractionation. Although the organic matter at both study sites had relatively high C:N and C:P ratios, the anoxic sediment decomposition was not affected by nutrient enrichments at the level applied in this study. The sediment metabolism (TCO2 and DOC production, and sulfate consumption) was 5-10 times higher in Wadden Sea sediment than in Bangrong mangrove sediment, probably due to the higher content of structural carbohydrates (e.g. cellulose) as indicated by higher C:N and C:P ratios in mangrove organic matter. This is substantiated by a lower nutrient release from Bangrong mangrove sediments and suggests a faster turnover of N and P by nutrient deficient bacteria in the mangrove sediment. DIP was released during anoxic decomposition in Wadden Sea sediment, but was retained in Bangrong mangrove sediment. Analysis of phosphor-us fractions in Bangrong mangrove sediment revealed that added excess DIP was efficiently taken up by the sediment particles and primarily retrieved in the easily exchangeable and iron bound fractions. The studied mangrove forest sediment seems to be a phosphorus sink. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - The performance of a polymeric membrane-based pH microelectrode and a new pCO(2) microelectrode in marine sediments is evaluated for the purpose of collecting fine-scale and undisturbed porewater profiles of carbon dioxide parameters. Both microelectrodes have a precision of 0.01-0.02 logarithmic units. A fine-scale porewater profile of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) is calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data and is in good agreement with coarse-scale TCO2 profiles measured in squeezed porewater. The measuring uncertainty for TCO2 is within 5%. The measurements of the pH microelectrode also agree in general with those of a glass mini-electrode. The mini-electrode, however, measures smaller pH changes as a result of mixing the sediments.
   Very low pH values (< 6.0) are measured in this salt marsh-influenced sediment and are correlated to the oxidation of Mn2+, Fe2+, and possibly, solid sulfides. Concentration profiles and fluxes of TCO2, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- are calculated from the pH and pCO(2) data. These millimeter-scale profiles demonstrate that the calculation of benthic flux of TCO2 based on porewater TCO2 profiles and on a HCO3- (or a concentration "weighted") diffusion coefficient can be erroneous. When porewater pH is very low(< 7.0) in the near-surface sediment, as is the case in many organic-rich coastal sediments, TCO2 transport is accomplished significantly through the diffusion of CO2 and can be greatly enhanced due to a sharp concentration gradient and a large diffusion coefficient of CO2.

AB  - We quantified the independent impacts of flooding salinity, flooding depth, and flooding frequency on the native species, Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, and on the invasive species Spartina alterniflora in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. Total biomass of all three species decreased significantly with increasing salinity, but S. alterniflora was less severely affected than P. australis and S. mariqueter. Elevated flooding depth significantly decreased their live aboveground biomass of P. australis and S. mariqueter, while S. alterniflora still had high live aboveground biomass and total biomass even at the highest flooding depth. These findings indicated that S. alterniflora was more tolerant to experimental conditions than the two native species, and an unavoidable suggestion is the expansion of this non-native species in relation to the native counterparts in future scenarios of increased sea-level and saltwater intrusion. Even so, environmental stresses might lead to significant decreases in total biomass and live aboveground biomass of all three species, which would potentially weaken their ability to trap sediments and accumulate organic matter. However, the relatively high belowground-to-aboveground biomass ratio indicated phenotypic plasticity in response to stressful environmental conditions, which suggest that marsh species can adapt to sea-level rise and maintain marsh elevation.

AB  - Denitrification is an important pathway of NO removal depending on wetland soil characteristics. Most studies on denitrification have been conducted in the freshwater wetlands and coastal marshes, but little information is available on how soil and environmental factors affect denitrification of saline wetlands in semi-arid regions. We conducted a correlative study on denitrification potential in relation to the physicochemical and biological characteristics. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from different halophyte communities along a saline-impact gradient around Wuliangsuhai Lake, i.e. Comm. Salicornia europaea (CSE), Comm. Suaeda glauca (CSG), Comm. Kalidium foliatum (CKF) and Comm. Sophora alopecuroides (CSA). The CSA soil profile showed the fastest denitrification kinetics and tended to yield the largest amount of N2O, followed by the CKF, CSG and CSE. The mean of potential denitrification rates was the highest across all depths of the CSA soil profile, followed by the CKF. CSG, and CSE. Principal component analysis indicated that exchangeable sodium percentage was a key factor to denitrification potential, apart from organic carbon, nitrate and denitrifying bacteria. The results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of salined wetlands for treating nutrient-rich return water from farmland, industrial wastewater and domestic sewage in the diverted trunk drain used for the lakeshore restoration.

AB  - The original ferrozine method has been modified to sequentially determine the Fe(II)/Fe(III) speciation in small volumes of fresh and marine water samples, at the submicromolar level. Spectrophotometric analyses of the Fe(II)ferrozine complex are performed on a single aliquot before and after a reduction step with hydroxylamine. The procedure is calibrated using Fe(III) standards stable under normal conditions of analysis. It is shown also that the presence of high concentrations of dissolved NOM (natural organic matter) do not create any significant artifacts. The method was used to measure Fe(II) and Fe(III) depth distribution in salt marsh pore waters and in a stratified marine basin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal marsh habitats are impacted by many disturbances, including habitat destruction, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species. The common reed, Phragmites australis, has been particularly invasive in the mesohaline regions of the Chesapeake Bay, but few studies have investigated its role in trophic interactions with North American marsh consumers. The marsh periwinkle snail Littoraria irrorata is a common grazer in marshes and grazes on the native grass Spartina alterniflora. Whether this snail grazes on Phragmites has not been addressed. We found Spartina leaves to be tougher than those of Phragmites, but despite this, snails consumed significantly more Spartina than Phragmites. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that Phragmites is chemically deterrent to snails by an unknown, moderately polar, compound. Further studies are required to more fully understand the interactions between Phragmites, herbivores, and Spartina, and how they may impact marsh ecosystems.

AB  - The application of the Poisson regression to the populations of the benthic foraminifer Ammonia tepida collected in three south-western Spanish estuaries permits to obtain a quantitative approach between some environmental variables and the number of individuals of this species. Although the three general models are unsatisfactory to predict the observed abundance of this micro-organism, a partial statistical analysis permits to detect quantitatively the impact of each variable. This analysis indicates an increasing abundance from the high-salt marshes to the subtidal channels and higher densities in those samples subjected to very euryhaline conditions. Increasing sand percentages show negative effects on the A. tepida abundance, whereas the silt contents do not affect significantly to this species and increasing organic carbon percentages have a small positive effect on the A. tepida densities.

T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The Corrubedo beach-lagoon complex is situated in an embayment on the northwestern coast of Spain.  The 4.1 m tidal range and southwesterly winds are the main agents of sediment transportation.  The sediments are hybrid arenites (siliciclastic + bioclastic), with carbonate percentages ranging from 27.36 to 54.10%; silt, clay and organic matter occur in minor amounts.  Repeated mapping and sampling of the beach, tidal channels, salt marshes and active and vegetated dunes recorded the vertical facies associations and their temporal evolution.  Two peat layers at 0.6 and 1.7 m below the present-day marsh have yielded ages of 2280 +/- 60 yrs B.P. and 1045 +/- 125 yrs B.P. respectively.  The possible causes of the relative sea-level rise are discussed.

AB  - Iron (Fe) plaque formation is a well known phenomenon in wetland, freshwater and salt marsh species; however there are no reports about Fe plaque occurrence in seagrasses. Here we review the main factors regulating Fe deposition on the roots and rhizomes of plants from reduced sediments/soils, and discuss these factors in relation to marine environment. Moreover, we present some early observations and quantification of Fe plaque on the tropical seagrass Cymodocea serrulata. Based on these first results and literature data, we compare the seagrass C. serrulata with the freshwater macrophyte Lobelia dortmanna performance and efficiency with regard to plaque formation. The comparison shows that regardless of the lower oxygen release to the sediment and less favourable sediment conditions with high pH, low organic matter content, high carbonate content and actively ongoing sulphate reduction, the seagrass is able to develop significant Fe plaques on roots and rhizomes. Thus we conclude that seagrasses have the necessary characteristics for plaque formation, and that marine sediments may be a favourable environment for Fe plaque development. Moreover, we suggest the likelihood of finding Fe deposits also on other species than C. serrulata and in other geographical locations.

AB  - Heavy metal distribution in soils is affected by soil aggregate fractionation. This study aimed to demons trate the aggregate-associated heavy metal concentrations and fractionations in "sandy," "normal," and "mud" soils from the restored brackish tidal marsh, oil exploitation zone, and tidal mudflat of the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China.
   Soil samples were sieved into the aggregates of > 2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and < 0.053 mm to determine the concentrations of exchangeable (F1), carbonate-bound (F2), reducible (F3), organic-bound (F4), and residual fraction (F5) of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn.
   The 0.25-2 mm aggregates presented the highest concentrations but the lowest mass loadings (4.23-12.18 %) for most metal fractions due to low percentages of 0.25-2 mm aggregates (1.85-3.12 %) in soils. Aggregates < 0.053 mm took majority mass loadings of metals in sandy and normal soils (62.04-86.95 %). Most soil aggregates had residual Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and reducible Cd, Pb dominated in the total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations. Sandy soil contained relatively high F4, especially of Cu (F4) in 0.25-2 mm aggregates (10.22 mg kg(-1)), which may relate to significantly high organic carbon contents (23.92 g kg(-1), P < 0.05). Normal soil had the highest total concentrations of metals, especially of Cu, Ni, and Pb, which was attributed to the high F3 and F5 in the < 0.053 mm aggregates. Although mud soil showed low total concentrations of heavy metals, the relatively high concentrations of bioavailable Cd and Cu resulted from the relatively high Cd (F2) and Cu (F2) in the > 2 mm aggregates indicated contribution of carbonates to soil aggregation and metal adsorption in tidal mud flat.
   Soil type and aggregate distribution were important factors controlling heavy metal concentration and fractionation in YRD wetland soil. Compared with mud soil, normal soil contained increased concentrations of F5 and F3 of metals in the 0.053-0.25 mm aggregate, and sandy soil contained increased concentrations of bioavailable and total Cr, Ni, and Zn with great contribution of mass loadings in the < 0.053 mm aggregate. The results of this study suggested that oil exploitation and wetland restoration activities may influence the retention characteristics of heavy metals in tidal soils through variation of soil type and aggregate fractions.

AB  - Based on surficial sediment samples, experiments of the trapping effect by vegetation on suspended particles, as well as measurements of changes in the sediment surface, this article deals mainly with general grain-size characteristics, the organic content of the sediments, the accretion rate in tidal marshes and the influence of the plant community along with the effect of benthic fauna on sedimentation. Conclusions that were reached included (a) mean grain-size M z (Phi) is between 3.0 and 8.5 under fair-weather conditions and can be as low as 2.5 in storm events, the grain-size composition is similar to the composition of the Yangtze River sediment; (b) a trend that the finer half of the sediment samples covers a wider grain-size range than the coarse half is shown by the fact that M z (Phi) >Phi(50) for 96% of the samples and SKr>0 for 97% of the samples; (c) positive correlation between M z and sigma(1) supports the observation that sediment sorting is functionally related to grain-size with the best sorting occurring at a median grain-size of 2.5 Phi-3.0 Phi. This fact corresponds to the theory that less energy is needed for the transport of fine sands (compared with both coarser and finer grains); (d) the organic content in surficial sediments is less than 1.5%. This low content of organic matter largely results from a high accretion rate of mineral grains from the river; (e) the grain-size of surficial sediment varies both temporally and spatially. The finest sediments occur in the centre of the marsh, becoming coarser peripherally. Around the island, the coarsest grain-size occurs on the seaside because of a higher water energy there. Grain-size in the main marsh is also influenced by seasonal changes in the plant community while the water energy especially during the storms has a large effect on the grain-size of the bare flats as well as on the outer area of the marsh; (f) accretion rates in marsh areas can be up to several decimeters. In this type of environment, the trapping effects of plants, as well as the biodeposition by benthic fauna, contribute very little to the total sedimentation. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Estuarine fringe marshes provide essential ecosystem services to coastal regions, including carbon sequestration and provision of shelter and nursery grounds for aquatic and terrestrial animals. The ability of a marsh to sustain itself by vertical accretion in response to sea-level rise is, in part, limited by inorganic sediment supply. Models attempting to forecast salt-marsh response to future sea-level rise commonly ignore land-use changes, despite the recent coastal population boom and the potential of land-use changes to alter sediment sources and modify established sediment-transport pathways. This study investigates the impacts of landscape modifications, which are typical of coastal areas, on the nearshore sedimentation and edge evolution of two fringing marshes. The sites examined include a marsh fringing the upper bay and a marsh fringing a beach ridge on the estuarine shoreline of a barrier island. Both sites are located in the same estuarine system, have similar hydrologic settings and comparable vegetation densities. Previous work, marsh cores, and a historical record from aerial photos indicate that although the fringe marshes are in different geomorphic locations, prior to anthropogenic modifications they were similar in terms of nearshore-sediment composition, scarp-shoreline morphology, and shoreline trajectory. The upper-bay marsh was impacted by the introduction of tree farming in the watershed of a tributary creek to the upper bay, which increased upland erosion and caused higher sedimentation rates in the estuary. The back-barrier marsh, which received no contribution from the tree farm because it is distal with respect to river input, was modified by the installation of a pier and rock sill. Terrestrial LIDAR, surface elevation tables, and accretion rates obtained from radioisotope analyses show that the deforestation induced high rates of nearshore and marsh accretion at the upper-bay site, which is promoting marsh colonization and expansion. These same types of data, in addition to aerial photos, were obtained at the back-barrier site and show increased rates of marsh-shoreline erosion adjacent to the structures. The fringing marshes were once similar, but started to evolve differently over a short time period as a result of human-induced changes to the landscape. Coastal development can significantly influence marsh-shoreline behavior, which must be taken into account when developing models of coastal response to sea-level rise. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The trophic dynamic Links of migratory juvenile brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus were investigated along the South Texas coast from the Aransas Pass to Corpus Christi and Nueces Bay and to the nursery ground in the Nueces Delta. Shrimps and their potential food sources were measured for delta(13)C and delta(15)N ratios between December 1995 and July 1996. During this period, shrimp length increased from 10 to 11 mm, when the animals entered Corpus Christi Bay as larvae, to 80-90 mm, when they returned to Mexico Gulf as sub-adults. Brown shrimp exhibited spatial and temporal delta(13)C variation (from -25.2 to 12.5 parts per thousand), indicating a high diversity of food sources throughout their migration. From delta(13)C values, the main sources used as food sources by juvenile brown shrimp in the Rincon Bayou marsh were Spartina alterniflora and S. spartinae detritus and benthic diatoms. delta(13)C and delta(15)N values showed that organic matter inputs carried by the river inflow can also contribute significantly to the feeding of migratory brown shrimp. In these marsh habitats, shrimp isotopic ratios changed rapidly, suggesting high tissue turnover rates. The study showed that coastal marshes after restoration through the introduction of freshwater inflow may provide feeding habitats favorable for growth and development of juvenile brown shrimp.

AB  - This collection of papers provides insights into methods and data currently available to quantify the benefits associated with estuarine habitat restoration projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA, with potential applicability to other coastal systems. Extensive habitat restoration is expected to occur in the northern Gulf of Mexico region over the next several decades through funding associated with the 2010Deepwater Horizonoil spill. Papers in this section examine the development of vegetation, soil properties, invertebrate fauna, and nekton communities in restored coastal marshes and provide a conceptual framework for applying these findings to quantify the benefits associated with compensatory marsh restoration. Extensive meta-analysis of existing data for Gulf of Mexico coastal habitats further confirms that structured habitats such as marsh, submerged aquatic vegetation, and oyster reefs support greater nekton densities than nonvegetated bottom habitat, with oyster reefs supporting different species assemblages than marsh and submerged aquatic vegetation. Other papers demonstrate that while vegetation cover can establish rapidly within the first 5 years of restoration, belowground parameters such as root biomass and soil organic matter remain 44% to 92% lower at restored marshes than reference marshes 15 years after restoration. On average, amphipod and nekton densities are also not fully restored until at least 20 and 13 years following restoration, respectively. Additional papers present methods to estimate the benefits associated with marsh restoration projects, nekton productivity associated with coastal and estuarine habitats, and the benefits associated with the removal of derelict crab traps in Gulf of Mexico estuaries.

AB  - Research into biotic interactions has been a core theme of ecology for over a century. However, despite the obvious role that biota play in the global carbon cycle, the effects of biotic interactions on carbon pools and fluxes are poorly understood. Here we develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the importance of biotic interactions in regulating carbon cycling based on a literature review and a quantitative synthesis by means of meta-analysis. Our study focuses on blue carbon ecosystems-vegetated coastal ecosystems that function as the most effective long-term CO2 sinks of the biosphere. We demonstrate that a multitude of mutualistic, competitive and consumer-resource interactions between plants, animals and microbiota exert strong effects on carbon cycling across various spatial scales ranging from the rhizosphere to the landscape scale. Climate change-sensitive abiotic factors modulate the strength of biotic-interaction effects on carbon fluxes, suggesting that the importance of biota-mediated carbon cycling will change under future climatic conditions. Strong effects of biotic interactions on carbon cycling imply that biosphere-climate feedbacks may not be sufficiently represented in current Earth system models. Inclusion of new functional groups in these models, and new approaches to simplify species interactions, may thus improve the predictions of biotic effects on the global climate.

AB  - Methane emissions from wetlands contribute to the currently rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacteriutn, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H-2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H') of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.

AB  - This study evaluated quantitative indices (soil organic matter, labile C, and sulfate concentrations) correlated with methane production rates along related vegetation and salinity gradients in the Louisiana coastal marsh region. Expressed on a soil dry mass basis, soil labile C was the variable most closely correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.69). Expressed on a surface area basis, labile C and SO42- were both significantly correlated with CH4 production rates (R(2)=0.36). Lower CH, production rates in saline marshes were attributed to higher SO42- content per unit area. This effect was confounded with the effect of plant species changes along the salinity gradient. Soils under Spartina patens produced less CH4 if collected from brackish marshes than from less saline intermediate marshes. Thus, variation in CH4 production across the broader gradient was not a result of plant species changes alone. Laboratory production data such as this can be useful in designing sampling schemes for future studies of field CH4 emissions.

AB  - The use of octenol in combination with carbon dioxide (CO2)-baited encephalitis virus surveillance (EVS) mosquito traps was evaluated under Simulated wartime operational conditions during Operation Tandem Thrust (TT01) at the Shoalwater Bay Training area, Queensland, Australia in 2001. A greater number of mosquito species were Captured in traps baited with octenol plus CO2 than those baited with CO2 or octenol in the saltwater marsh, Freshwater Beach. In the inland environments of Camp Growl and Raspberry Creek, the addition of octenol did not significantly increase the numbers of Mosquito species captured. Trap treatment (octenol only, CO2 only, or octenol plus CO2) influenced the species captured at Freshwater Beach. More Ochlerotatus vigilax, Mansonia uniformis, and Coquillettidia xanthogaster were captured in traps baited with octenol plus CO2, and more Anopheles were captured in traps baited With CO2 only. The most commonly Captured (83%) mosquito species in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area during TT01 was the salt marsh breeder and Ross River virus vector, Oc. vigilax.

AB  - Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

AB  - Seagrass meadows provide numerous ecosystem services and their rapid global loss may reduce human welfare as well as ecological integrity. In common with the other 'blue carbon' habitats (mangroves and tidal marshes) seagrasses are thought to provide coastal defence and encourage sediment stabilisation and surface elevation. A sophisticated understanding of sediment elevation dynamics in mangroves and tidal marshes has been gained by monitoring a wide range of different sites, located in varying hydrogeomorphological conditions over long periods. In contrast, similar evidence for seagrasses is sparse; the present study is a contribution towards filling this gap. Surface elevation change pins were deployed in four locations, Scotland, Kenya, Tanzania and Saudi Arabia, in both seagrass and unvegetated control plots in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal zone. The presence of seagrass had a highly significant, positive impact on surface elevation at all sites. Combined data from the current work and the literature show an average difference of 31 mm per year in elevation rates between vegetated and unvegetated areas, which emphasizes the important contribution of seagrass in facilitating sediment surface elevation and reducing erosion. This paper presents the first multi-site study for sediment surface elevation in seagrasses in different settings and species.

AB  - In marine sediments, Fe(III) is found predominantly as a solid. Recently, however, soluble species of Fell complexed by natural organic ligands have been detected in coastal marine sediments with voltammetric microelectrodes. The role of soluble Fe3+ complexes in diagenesis is unknown. In anoxic conditions, soluble Fell can effectively oxidize FeS2 and recycle iron and sulfur for use as terminal electron acceptors during natural organic matter (NOM) degradation. Alternatively, soluble Fe3+ complexes can catalyze the formation of FeS and FeS2 through the rapid chemical reduction of Fell by dissolved sulfide. To better understand the role of soluble Fell in the transformation of iron and sulfur in marine sediments, we incubated the first few centimeters of unvegetated salt marsh sediment in plug-flow reactors. Microbial iron reduction seemed to prevail in suboxic conditions, but sulfate reduction outcompeted microbial iron reduction in the presence of reactive organic metabolites. The dominance of sulfate reduction led to the complete removal of reactive iron oxides by precipitation of FeS. Experiments mimicking the enrichment of soluble Fell Complexes in reduced sediments show that soluble Fe3+ does not reoxidize FeS and pyrite; rather, it promotes pyrite precipitation by enhancing sulfate reduction via complex bacterial interactions. The rate of pyrite formation in the presence of soluble Fell is much higher than previously reported in the literature, suggesting that soluble Fell might promote alternative pathways for microbial degradation of NOM that ultimately results in the immobilization of Fe and S as reduced iron sulfide minerals.

AB  - Water and sediment samples were collected from the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary and the adjacent East China Sea during impoundment of the river at the Three Gorges Dam. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic nutrients, and particulate inorganic phosphorus and particulate organic phosphorus in the water column (PIP and POP, respectively) and sediments (SIP and SOP, respectively) were analyzed. The nutrient dynamics in salt marshes associated with the Changjiang estuary were also considered. In addition, river water samples were collected bimonthly in the lower reaches of the Changjiang. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients, PIP and POP showed temporal and spatial variations, which decreased from the coast to offshore areas. The dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus (P) concentrations showed patchy distributions, but were consistent with the distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Phosphorus is the major limiting element for phytoplankton growth. Among the various P forms, particulate P represented 38-52% of total P. The PIP and POP concentrations showed clear seasonal variations corresponding to the occurrence of the levels of suspended particulate matter. The P accumulation rates showed a decreasing trend from the coast to offshore areas, and high P burial efficiencies were found; the latter were related to a low benthic PO43- flux and high sediment accumulation rates. The potential bioavailable P was estimated to be 65-70% of total P, of which more than two-thirds was regenerated in the water column. The salt marsh in the Changjiang estuary plays an important ecological role in nutrient transport from the river to offshore areas, and increased P limitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study combines an analysis of porewater chemistry with new, solid phase wet chemical extractions to examine the seasonal cycling of Fe in vegetated and unvegetated (cyanobacterial mat) saltmarsh sediments. Saltmarsh sediments are shown to contain more solid phase reactive Fe than other marine sediments studied so far. From the partitioning and speciation of solid Fe, and solid/soluble reduced S analysis in 10 sediment cores, we have observed that a majority of solid Fe in these sediments is cycled rapidly and completely between oxidized reactive Fe and reduced Fe as pyrite. Vegetated porewaters showed a lower pH and much higher Fe(II) concentrations on average than unvegetated porewaters in the top 10 cm, whereas sulfate, alkalinity, and sulfide concentrations were similar in the two environments. The amorphous Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation to solid and soluble reduced S (r(2) = -0.86 and -0.71, respectively) in surface vegetated sediments whereas the crystalline Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation (r(2) = -0.96) to sulfide only at depth. Though reactive Fe was observed in unvegetated sediments, no seasonal trend was apparent and the speciation of solid Fe revealed that most of it was reduced. Solid phase and porewater chemistry support the dominant role of the biota (Spartina alterniflora and bacteria) in controlling the reactivity of Fe and suggest that the current definition of solid phase, reactive Fe should be expanded to include crystalline Fe(III) minerals which are available for pyrite formation in saltmarsh sediments. In support of previous saltmarsh studies, we present evidence that the redox cycle of solid Fe is controlled by sulfate reduction and sediment oxidation which respond to both annual cycles (light, temperature) and to short-term, episodic effects such as weather and tides.

AB  - Waterfowl and migratory birds rely on wetland habitat in coastal temperate regions for breeding and feeding. Over the past few decades, freshwater impoundments have been created in the Cumberland Marsh Region of Canada to compensate for regional loss of ecosystem services and habitat. The objective of our study was to determine whether freshwater impoundments underlain by tidal marsh sediments, and located where marine influences exist, are predisposed to higher nutrient levels and more conducive to productive habitat than waterfowl habitat elsewhere in Canada and the northeastern United States. We found that impoundment subsurface waters were generally circumneutral with moderate concentrations of dissolved organic carbon ranging between 6.30 and 13.90mg/L. Furthermore, these impoundments generally had higher concentrations of cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na), anions (Cl-, SO42-), and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon) than other freshwater waterbodies studied for waterfowl in central Ontario, Maine and Nova Scotia, but lower concentrations than found in Prairie potholes. Our data indicate that a lack of hydrological connectivity and nutrient pathways may be limiting impoundments from reaching their full potential for supporting wildlife. We recognize that additional research on fostering ecosystem services from wetland restoration and creation projects is necessary on former tidal marshland.

AB  - Growth and survival of transplanted vegetation for salt marsh restoration can be greatly affected by edaphic conditions. We investigated the potential for an organic carbon sediment amendment, alginate, to enhance establishment and growth of Spartina alterniflora transplants, as well as colonization by macroinvertebrates commonly associated with S. alterniflora (Uca sp. and Littoraria irrorata). Plots were established in a bare mud area previously inhabited by S. alterniflora, and transplant rhizospheres were either treated with alginate or left unamended as controls. Growth of transplanted S. alterniflora and colonization by Uca sp. and L. irrorata were evaluated over portions of three growing seasons. Within the first month post-transplantation, a nonsignificant trend toward greater live stem density emerged, but disappeared completely by week ten. Both Uca sp. and L. irrorata densities were significantly greater in the alginate treatment compared to the control only during the first ten weeks post-transplantation. However, the initial organic content of the sediment in the transplant area was more than twice that in the adjacent natural marsh. Therefore, our findings suggest that a threshold level of sediment organic matter above which alginate addition does not confer an advantage on transplanted S. alterniflora may exist, and the conditions under which amendments are most beneficial to transplanted S. alterniflora should be determined.

AB  - Coastal communities, knowingly or otherwise, rely on seagrasses for their livelihood, recreation and food source, among other services. However, despite its importance, seagrasses are not receiving similar attentions with its adjacent ecosystems, the mangroves, and coral reefs. Because of their role in climate change mitigation, seagrasses along with mangroves and salt marshes (the blue carbon ecosystems) are gaining attention recently. This preliminary study investigates the perception of coastal communities in Eastern Samar, Philippines on seagrasses. The results of the survey show that there is a level of high awareness among respondents to seagrass ecosystem services. Despite that, however, utilization remains low. The level of awareness varies on the type of ecosystem service; for instance, locals have a high awareness of provisioning services while low awareness of cultural services. The survey also included the perceived threats to seagrasses, where damages caused by natural disturbances are identified as the most concerning threat. This may be due to the geographic location of the sites that are frequented by typhoons. The perception potentially indicates depleted resources brought about by mismanagement or overlooking this natural resource. The results provide a more contextualized understanding on how local communities are aware of and interacting with, or the lack thereof, seagrass ecosystems. This could aid local government units (LGUs) and conservation groups in the area to craft practicable and sustainable management plans and threat-specific solutions.

AB  - Giral Lignite Mine succession (Akli Formation)from Barmer Basin, Rajasthan yielded rich assemblage of dinoflagellate cysts and compared with the global dinoflagellate zonation schemes, and a Danian-Thanetian age is proposed. Within a precise biostratigraphic control, changes in the terrestrial and marine palynomorphs allowed the construction of relative sea level fluctuation curve and the development of depositonal succession in a sequence stratigraphic framework. Based on the lithological and palynological content, the Giral Lignite Mine succession is divided in to five units. Unit 1 (lower 7.8 m) is interpreted as transgressive deposit formed in an open bay setting during rise in the relative sea level representing the Transgressive Systems Tract (TST). The age is Danian on the basis of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. Unit 2 (16.5 m) consists of5-6 laterally occurring lignite bands. It is deposited during decrease of sea level and increased detritus supply in essentially salt marsh environment during Highstand Systems Tract (HST). Unit 3 (3.42 m) is shallow marine facies ofThanetian age deposited in a restricted setting represents a Transgressive Systems Tract. Unit 4 (0.9 m) is marked by a return to coastal marsh depositional conditions, possibly representing a Highstand Systems Tract. The erosional surface at the top of Unit 4 is interpreted as a Sequence Boundary. Unit 5 (9.3 m) is highly oxydized and is devoid of any organic matter content. Two major marine flooding surfaces identified in the Giral Lignite Mine succession can be correlated with the Maximum Flooding Surfaces (MFS) at 60.7 Ma and 57.9 Ma corresponding to the eustatic curve. Based on the dinoflagellate biostratigraphy Danian- Thanetian age has been assigned to the lignite bearing succession of Giral Mine. Western Indian margin consist of large-scale lignite deposits in Kutch, Cambay and Rajasthan Basin. The proposed Danian-Thanetian age of lignite bearing succession of Giral Mine is much older than the late Thanetian-early Ypresian age of lignite successions of Cambay and Kutch Basins of Gujarat. The present study suggests a significantly diachronous development of lignite deposits on the western peninsular margin of India.

AB  - Human population growth and development have heavily degraded coastal ecosystems with cascading impacts across multiple trophic levels. Understanding both the direct and indirect trophic effects of human activities is important for coastal conservation. In New England, recreational overfishing has triggered a regional trophic cascade. Predator depletion releases the herbivorous purple marsh crab from consumer control and leads to overgrazing of marsh cordgrass and salt marsh die-off. The direct and indirect trophic effects of predator depletion on basal trophic levels, however, are not understood. Using observational and experimental data, we examined the hypotheses that (1) direct trophic effects of predator depletion decrease meiofaunal abundance by releasing deposit feeding fiddler crabs from consumer control, and/or (2) indirect trophic effects of predator depletion increase meiofaunal abundance by releasing blue carbon via the erosion of centuries of accreted marsh peat. Experimental deposit feeder removal led to 23% higher meiofaunal density at die-off than at healthy sites, while reciprocally transplanting sediment from die-off and healthy sites revealed that carbon-rich die-off sediment increased meiofauna density by over 164%: six times stronger than direct trophic effects. Recovering sites had both carbon-rich sediment and reduced deposit feeding leading to higher meiofauna densities than both die-off and healthy sites. This suggests that consequences of the trophic downgrading of coastal habitats can be driven by both direct and indirect trophic mechanisms that may vary in direction and magnitude, making their elucidation dependent on experimental manipulations.

AB  - The response of primary producers to changes in environmental and sea-level conditions is an important topic in the study of estuarine ecosystems. Currently, sea levels are rising, and North American estuaries are in declining ecological health (USEPA, 2002 National Coastal Condition Report. USEPA, Washington, DC). This investigation examines the base of the estuarine-food web by evaluating the diets of modern and fossil Mercenaria spp. These clams are infaunal,. primary consumers that feed on suspended organic matter. Proteinaceous materials secreted within the biominerals of shell-building organisms are derived from the same diet sources as soft tissue and, therefore, are also capable of recording diet information. We have developed an empirical relationship between the isotopic composition of shell organic matter and, soft tissue, which allows food web analyses in fossils to proceed in the same manner as modern food web studies. The Delta(tissue-shell) for delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S is 0.1, 0.7, and 1.8parts per thousand. Isotopic analyses of modern Mercenaria spp. shells from coastal Virginia (delta(13)C: -12.8 to -15.9parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 11.3 to 13.7parts per thousand), and the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida (delta(13)C: -19.4 to -21.0parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 7.2-9.9parts per thousand) demonstrate, that diets are derived from phytoplankton and local salt marsh plants. Shell organic-matter delta(13)C varies from -13.1 to -27.5parts per thousand and delta(15)N varies from 2.4 to 9.8parts per thousand in Quaternary Mercenaria spp. from coastal Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia. These data demonstrate that past diet sources have changed in space and time. The fact that past sea-level changes have been accompanied by shifts in local primary production is evidence that significant changes might also occur in association with presently rising sea levels.

AB  - We studied how plant species distribution was regulated by the relationships between vegetation and soil factors on the southwestern coast of South Korea. Vegetation was classified using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), thereby producing four vegetation groups that were linked to three habitat types. Two ordination techniques - detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) - were applied to examine the relationships between vegetation and 12 edaphic factors, including soil pH, water and osmotic potentials, moisture content, electrical conductivity, Cl- and Na+ contents, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and contents of organic matter, sand, silt, and clay. Results were similar for both types of evaluations. According to DCA and CCA, the 23 communities tended to cluster into three types: salt swamp, salt marsh, and sand dune. The first two canonical axes accounted for 14.9% of the community-soil factor re,lationship among communities. As identified via CCA, the main gradients were soil-water relations and soil texture.

AB  - Purposes of this study were to determine the relative importance of organic matter and mineral matter to marsh vertical accretion and to determine if insufficient vertical accretion was a factor in land loss in a Terrebonne Basin (Louisiana, USA) marsh. Cs-137 dating indicated that vertical accretion (0.98 cm yr-1) was extremely rapid relative to other marshes, but insufficient to counter submergence (1.38 cm yr-1). Mineral and organic matter accumulation were similar to that in other marshes. Variation in vertical accretion was accounted for by variation in organic matter accumulation rather than mineral matter accumulation; thus, inadequate vertical accretion resulted from inadequate organic matter accumulation. Inadequate organic matter accumulation (593 g m-2 yr-1) was attributed to inadequate plant production resulting primarily from flooding stresses; inadequate mineral matter accumulation (1629 g m-2 yr-1) was attributed to inadequate mineral matter availability. These data suggest that this marsh is threatened by a positive feedback loop of plant flooding stress and inadequate vertical accretion. Inadequate plant growth limits vertical accretion, which further increases flooding and decreases plant production. Thus plant production, which has previously been considered only in the context of trophic dynamics, also partly determines the degree of submergence some coastal and estuarine marshes will tolerate.

AB  - Coastal soils are recognized as a valuable global resource because of their important roles in maintaining ecosystem services, especially C storage. Exotic species often have negative impacts on biodiversity but less is known about their potential benefits for soil function. We investigated impacts of Spartina alterniflora Loisel. on soil functions (based on basic chemical and physical properties) related to soil depth on a coastline of the East China Sea. Subsequently, we assessed the trend of soil functions by integrating multiple soil functions into a single index. The results showed that significant relationships were observed between the age of S. alterniflora and the factors soil organic C (SOC) storage soil pH in the topsoil (30 cm), and soil salinity within the upper 1 m depth. These results implied that some soil functions were enhanced over time following the introduction of the species (i.e., C sequestration and desalinization). Spartina alterniflora had a positive effect on the basic functionality of soils in areas that do not have native salt marsh species. Over the course of exotic plant introduction, soil pH made the highest contribution at the beginning, whereas salinity gradually became the most important factor controlling the physicochemical functionality of soils. We suggest that it is essential to explicitly test the impacts of species introduction on soil functions to address key issues of the sustainable management of coastal soils.

AB  - Investigations of food digestibility are important in nutritional studies of herbivores, but accurate assessments in the field are usually difficult and time consuming. This study explored the possibility of predicting digestibility and metabolisability of organic matter from the chemical composition and retention time of food in barnacle geese Branta leucopsis. Captive birds were used in indoor trials to allow accurate assessments of digestion in terms of energy, organic matter and nutritional components. Retention times were estimated from dropping rates which were recorded by an electronic device. The regression models that best explained the variation in apparent digestibility and metabolisability of organic matter incorporated the proportion of cell walls in the food (acid detergent fibre had a negative effect) and the retention time (longer retention had a positive effect). To test the predictive power of the regression model, we performed seven field trials with captive barnacle geese on Festuca rubra salt marshes. The regression model proved reliable except when salt concentrations in the food were high following inundation by spring tides. The results obtained from this study further demonstrated its value in estimating the individual digestibility of each plant species in mixed diets. This is illustrated with reference to a study of food selection by brent geese Branta bernicla.

AB  - The effects of sorptive inert surfaces on growth of marine bacteria and metabolism, as well as partitioning of organic substrates, were examined in microcosms inoculated with bacterioplankton from a local salt marsh. Introduction of organic-free glass beads to a dilute seawater medium (tryptic soy broth) increased yields of ATP, a surrogate for bacterial biomass, by 187% within the entire microcosm (attached + free-living). Growth efficiencies (bacterial C/media C) were 30% for bacteria grown in microcosms with beads compared with 16% without beads. Surface enrichment increased rates of proteolytic enzyme activity and cell-specific [H-3]leucine incorporation into protein by factors of 6.8 and 2.2, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy revealed obvious organic coatings on all beads after 2 h of exposure, but few strongly attached bacteria were evident, even after 40 h of exposure. Results support the hypothesis that mineral surfaces facilitate bacterial utilization of complex organic matter through physical-chemical processes that increase conversion efficiencies of labile substrate despite possible kinetic limitations. Furthermore, firm attachment by bacteria to these surfaces is apparently not a requirement to produce surface-enhanced activity.

AB  - Understanding microbial carbon sources is fundamental to elucidating the role of microbial communities in carbon cycling and in the biodegradation of organic contaminants. Because the majority of anthropogenic contaminants are either directly or indirectly derived from fossil fuels that are devoid of C-14, radiocarbon can be used as a natural inverse tracer of contaminant carbon in the contemporary environment. Here, C-14 analysis of individual microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was used to characterize the carbon sources utilized by the active microbial community in salt marsh sediments contaminated by the Florida oil spill of 1969 in Wild Harbor, West Falmouth, MA. A specific goal was to determine whether this community is actively degrading petroleum residues that persist in these sediments. The Delta C-14 values of microbial PLFA in all sediment horizons (contaminated and noncontaminated) matched the Delta C-14 of the total sedimentary organic carbon after petroleum removal, indicating that no measurable metabolism of petroleum residues was occurring. This result agrees with ancillary data such as the delta C-13 content and distribution of PLFA, and the residual hydrocarbon composition determined by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) analysis. We hypothesize that microbes have chosen to respire the natural organic matter rather than the residual petroleum hydrocarbons because the former is more labile. Future efforts directed at determining indices of microbial degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons should consider competition with natural organic matter.

AB  - Biomass dynamics, decomposition and nutrient cycling were studied in a Sarcocornia perennis salt marsh in the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina) to achieve a better understanding of these processes and provide information about a species and a region underrepresented in the literature. Above and belowground biomass stocks and carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration in plant tissues were monitored every 2 months during a year. The decomposition rate and the concentration of C, N and P during the process were also estimated in above and belowground tissues. Biomass values were low (mean of 363 +/- 43 and 242 +/- 27 g m(-2) for aboveground and belowground tissues, respectively), presumably associated with the high salinity of this estuary. The general trend of higher values for aboveground biomass is in agreement with other reports for this species and has an effect on nutrients pools, which are higher for aboveground tissues for C and N. Above and belowground decomposition rates were high (64 and 70% after a year, respectively), meaning this process plays a significant role in the cycling of organic matter. C/N and C/P ratios changed during decomposition, but final ratios were usually higher, suggesting a net release of nutrients. Our results indicate that significant amounts of C, N and P are recycled by Sarcocornia perennis, highlighting the role of this species and suggesting important consequences of its lost in the study area.

AB  - Coastal wetlands comprise important global carbon sinks; however, anthropogenic disturbance accompanied with accelerating sea level rise threaten their continued survival. In this study, we quantified habitat disturbance to salt marshes in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, resulting from the construction of ponds for mosquito control. Geographic object-based image analysis of high-resolution four-band aerial imagery revealed that over 7,000 ponds were constructed in the marsh complex with pond densities as high as 290 ponds per km(2). Physical disturbance from pond creation and sediment dispersal extended to over 17% of the bay's tidal wetlands. By tracking recolonization of vegetation, we estimated that it took 5 years for 51% vegetation recovery and 10 years for 69% recovery, with complete recover (100%) not expected for more than 50 years. This suggests that efforts to extend the lifespan of drowning coastal wetlands through sediment additions might disrupt carbon dioxide assimilation, as effects of disturbance persist. Focusing on greenhouse gas exchange, our work found that areas of marsh vegetation contribute to carbon assimilation (-42 g C . m(-2) . year(-1)), while ponds and areas of bare peat created by pond excavation were associated with carbon emissions (44 and 125 g C . m(-2) . year(-1), respectively). These results suggest that the conversion of wetlands to ponds-which is a significant driver of coastal wetland loss worldwide-may convert coastal wetlands from greenhouse gas sinks to sources. Additionally, quantifying the area of vegetation within a marsh (vs. bare ground or open water) is important for quantifying their greenhouse gas mitigation function.
   Plain Language Summary Coastal wetlands are important for our planet as they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Our goal was to determine how the construction of ponds in wetlands-which is common worldwide to support expanding aquaculture-affects the ability of marshes to take up carbon dioxide. We estimated the number and extent of ponds constructed for mosquito control in coastal wetlands in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. Additionally, we measured greenhouse gas exchange from the ponds, surrounding intact marsh, and in bare areas at several sites across the growing season to estimate the total carbon uptake of the whole marsh. We found that over 7,000 ponds have been dug for mosquito control in New Jersey and that pond density is as high as 290 ponds per km(2). We also found that the ponds constructed in wetlands reduce the ability of wetlands to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

AB  - Adult female Tabanus nigrovittatus Macquart (Diptera: Tabanidae) were field collected from a salt marsh in Essex County, Massachusetts. The horse flies were transported back to and tested in the laboratory to determine the effects of octenol (1-octen-3-ol) on engorgement. Flies exposed to octenol strips had a significantly higher engorgement response compared with control flies. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an important link between an odor stimulus and the feeding response in Tabanidae. Research examining the link between odor attractants and repellents on the engorgement response is lacking or limited in most hernatopbagous Diptera. Understanding the role odors have on ingestion is essential to knowing how to interrupt feeding behavior of blood-feeding arthropods, especially for important vectors.

AB  - Modifications in land use and climate will result in shifts in the magnitude and composition of organic matter (OM) transported from wetlands to coastal waters, but differentiation between riverine and wetland OM sources in coastal areas remains a challenge. Here, we evaluate particulate and dissolved OM export dynamics in two representative estuary geomorphologies-Apalachicola Bay (AP) and Barataria Bay (BB), characterized primarily by blackwater river inputs and high particle abundance, respectively. The magnitude and composition of OM exported from each estuary was evaluated based on seasonal measurements of surface water dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen, the stable isotopic composition of DOC and POC, dissolved and particulate lignin phenols, and carbon-normalized dissolved lignin-phenol yields. Data and discriminant analyses support the initial hypothesis; AP is dominated by a more terrestrial source of OM due to importance of fluvial dissolved OM inputs, while BB is a more particle-rich and wetland carbon-dominated system. Total lignin export (sum of mean dissolved and mean particulate) was higher in BB (5.73 +/- 2.50 x 10(5) kg/year) than in AP (4.21 +/- 2.35 x 10(5) kg/year). Particulate lignin export from BB was greater than the export of dissolved lignin at either BB or AP, suggesting coastal marsh erosion may be driving this comparatively large export of particulate lignin. These data have important implications for the stability of stored OM in coastal habitats, particularly since such habitats in this region are highly vulnerable due to relative sea level rise.

AB  - This work contributes to the ongoing work aiming at confirming benthic foraminifera as a biological quality element. In this study, benthic foraminifera from intertidal and transitional waters from the English Channel/European Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean Sea were assigned to five ecological groups using the weighted-averaging optimum with respect to TOC of each species. It was however not possible to assign typical salt marsh species due to the presence of labile and refractory organic matter that hampers TOC characterization. Tests of this study species? lists with Foram-AMBI on two independent datasets showed a significant correlation between Foram-AMBI and TOC, confirming the strong relation between foraminifera and TOC. For one of the validation datasets, associated macrofaunal data were available and a significant correlation was found between the foraminiferal Foram-AMBI and the macrofaunal AMBI. The here proposed lists should be further tested with sensitivity-based indices in different European regional settings.

AB  - Salt marsh restoration is hypothesized to provide shoreline stabilization, increased fish habitat, and organic carbon subsidies for estuarine food webs. Organic carbon comes from diverse primary producers that differ in carbon fixation rates and areal extent within wetland systems. This study was designed to obtain some of the first estimates of the relative contribution of different primary producers to total organic carbon production within open water and tidally flooded wetlands of the northern San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Carbon fixation rates of phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, and low marsh emergent vegetation were measured in two natural and four restoring wetlands in 2004. Areal (m(2)) rates of carbon fixation were greatest for low marsh vegetation, while phytoplankton and microphytobenthos rates were one and two orders of magnitude lower, respectively. However, when areal production rates were scaled to the amount of habitat available for each primary producer group, the relative importance of each group varied by location. Given that each primary producer group supports a different subset of estuarine consumers, the type of food subsidy desired should influence the amount open water channel, mudflat and low marsh area restored. Large-scale wetland restoration activities should consider the types of primary producers likely to occupy restored habitats when estimating future food web impacts.

AB  - Two areas of salt marsh in the Sado estuary - Faralhao, on the industrialized north margin and Malha da Costa, on the south bank, sheltered by a uninhabited sand spit - have been cored to study the geochemical signature of anthropogenic activity in recent (19th century onwards) intertidal sediments. Short cores were taken from each site from both the high and low marsh and were studied for texture, organic matter, pH, carbonates and geochemistry, including the heavy metals Cu, Pb and Zn. The marsh sediments are free of carbonate bioclasts and quite uniform in texture, consisting of acid to neutral clayey silt in addition to organic matter, which is higher in the top 20 cm.
   The vertical concentration profiles of heavy metals indicates enrichment in the top 30 cm of the sediment of the high marsh, in contrast with underlying high and low marsh sediment that has concentrations of metals at both studied sites similar to the Average Shale international reference/ continental crust sediments. The geochemical signal of anthropogenic influence in the marsh sediment was determined to have commenced from 1900-1920 using the sedimentation rates derived from Pb-210 and Cs-137 analyses. Spatial contrast in contamination levels was found within the estuary, with sediments of the Faralhao marsh showing higher enrichment factors of all metals. The anthropogenic increase of the supply of metal to the Sado estuary resulted from extensive exploitation of pyrite ore in the drainage basin until the 1960's; since that time, the sediments record a break in metal input, which resulted from a decline of the mining industry. However, in the marsh located closer to the industrial area ( Faralhao) this break is followed by a local increase of heavy metal fluxes, which is interpreted as the result of intensification of anthropogenic influence. The comparison of metal concentrations in marsh sediments with target values established in quality guidelines indicates the studied area to be of environmental concern.

AB  - Understanding the complex, non-linear ways in which linked ecological and geomorphological systems respond to disturbance is important to improving both theoretical understanding and practical environmental management. Some simple conceptual models have been proposed to describe biogeomorphological responses to disturbance within fluvial and aeolian environments, and are reviewed here. Recent research on the interactions between ecological and geomorphological processes in rock breakdown, aeolian, hillslope, fluvial and coastal wetland process regimes indicates a number of additional factors which need to be considered by such models in order to provide a more realistic representation. In particular, many empirical studies point to complex interactions between vegetation, microphytic crusts and animal action (bioturbation and grazing) in a wide range of sediment systems, which act as intrinsic feedback factors complicating the response of these systems to disturbances such as climate change and human action. Improved understanding of these interactions will help effective environmental management, as exemplified by salt marsh restoration schemes. Furthermore, better specification of biogeomorphological interactions can provide insights into large-scale, long-term Earth systems dynamics problems such as the long-term carbon cycle.

AB  - To evaluate applicability of the end-member mixing model in assessment of input and transport of organic carbon in estuarine systems, we incubated marine diatom, land grass, and salt marsh plant in Altamaha estuarine water for two months. Chemical and isotopic parameters (bulk organic carbon/nitrogen contents, lipid compositions, stable C/N isotopes, and lipid stable carbon isotopic ratios) were analyzed for fresh and degraded materials. The results showed that although the C/N and delta N-15 ratios of three materials varied similarly during degradation, the bulk delta C-13, lipid compositions, and lipid stable carbon isotopic compositions varied differently from material to material and from compound to compound, implying that applications of the end-member model should consider the diagenetic status of organic materials and the potential changes in chemical and isotopic signatures.

AB  - The physical controlling factors on coastal plant communities are among the most dynamic of known ecosystems, but climate change alters coastal surface and subsurface hydrologic regimes, which makes rapid measurement of greenhouse gas fluxes critical. Greenhouse gas exchange rates in these terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems are highly variable worldwide with climate, soil type, plant community, and weather. Therefore, increasing data collection and availability should be a priority. Here, we demonstrate and validate physical and analytical modifications to automated soil-flux chamber measurement methods for unattended use in tidally driven wetlands, allowing the high-frequency capture of storm surge and day/night dynamics. Winter CO2 flux from Sarcocornia perennis marsh to the atmosphere was significantly greater during the day (2.8 mmol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the night (2.2 mmol m(-2) hr(-1); p < 0.001), while CH4 was significantly greater during the night (0.16 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the day (-0.13 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1); p = 0.04). The magnitude of CO2 flux during the day and the frequency of CH4 flux were reduced during a surge (p < 0.001). Surge did not significantly affect N2O flux, which without non-detects was normally distributed around -24.2 nmol m(-2) hr(-1). Analysis with sustained-flux global potentials and increased storm surge frequency scenarios, 2020 to 2100, suggested that the marsh in winter remains an atmospheric CO2 source. The modeled results showed an increased flux of CO2 to the atmosphere, while in soil, the uptake of CH4 increased and N2O uptake decreased. We present analytical routines to correctly capture gas flux curves in dynamic overland flooding conditions and to flag data that are below detection limits or from unobserved chamber-malfunction situations. Storm surge is an important phenomenon globally, but event-driven, episodic factors can be poorly estimated by infrequent sampling. Wider deployment of this system would permit inclusion of surge events in greenhouse gas estimates.

AB  - Reduced S groups in soil organic matter (OM) play an important rule in the complexation of heavy metals. These complexation reactions are often studied using the humic acid component of OM, The objective of our study was to determine the effect of pH on humic acid yield and the effect of pH and exposure to O-2 on the oxidation of reduced organic S, Humic acid was extracted at pH levels between 11.5 and 13.0 from a soil collected from a salt marsh, Also, aqueous samples of humic acid at different pH levels were aspirated with CO,free air for 4 or 44 h, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was used to determine changes in S oxidation states for the various treatments. With increasing pH, the yield of humic acid increased from 1.3 to 4.6 g humic acid kg(-1) soil, and the total S in these samples was 24 +/- 1 g kg(-1) humic acid, Linear-combination fitting of XANES spectra showed that all of these humic acid samples contained approximate to 70% (mol/mol) reduced S (modeled as benzyl disulfide) and 30% (mol/mol) oxidized S (modeled as sulfonate and ester sulfate). For humic acid exposed to aeration for 4 h at pH levels between 11.5 and 13.0, reduced organic S was oxidized only at pH 13.0 (15% [mol/mol] of total S), Samples exposed to aeration for 44 h between pH 3.5 and 12.4 showed no detectable change in reduced organic S.

AB  - Many researchers assume a proportional relationship among the atmospheric CO, concentration, temperature, and sea level. Thus, the rate of sea-level rise should increase in concert with the documented exponential increase in CO, Although sea surface temperature has increased in places over the past century and short-term sea level rose abruptly during the 1990s, it is difficult to demonstrate a proportional relationship using existing geologic or historic records. Tide gauge records in the United States cover too short a time interval to verify acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise, although multicentury tide gauge and staff records from the Netherlands and Sweden suggest a mid-19th-century acceleration in sea-level rise. Reconstructions of sea-level changes for the past 1000 years derived using benthic foraminifer data from salt marshes along the East Coast of the United States suggest an increased rate of relative sea-level rise beginning in the 1600s. Geologic records of relative sea-level rise for the past 6000 years are available for several sites along the US East Coast from C-14-dated basal peat below salt marshes and estuarine sediments. When these three scales of sea-level variation are integrated, adjusted for postglacial isostatic movement, and replotted, the range of variation in sea level suggested by basal peat ages is within +/- 1 meter of the long-term trend. The reconstruction from Long Island Sound data shows a linear rise in sea level beginning in the mid-1600s at a rate consistent with the historic record of mean high water. Long-term tide gauge records from Europe and North America show similar trends since the mid-19th century. There is no clear proportional exponential increase in the rate of sea-level rise. If proportionality exists among sea level, atmospheric CO, and temperature, there may be a significant time lag before an anthropogenic increase in the rate of sea-level rise occurs.

AB  - Marshes in the urban Jamaica Bay Estuary, New York, USA are disappearing at an average rate of 13 ha/yr, and multiple stressors (e.g., wastewater inputs, dredging activities, groundwater removal, and global warming) may be contributing to marsh losses. Among these stressors, wastewater nutrients are suspected to be an important contributing cause of marsh deterioration. We used census data, radiometric dating, stable nitrogen isotopes, and soil surveys to examine the temporal relationships between human population growth and soil nitrogen; and we evaluated soil structure with computer-aided tomography, surface elevation and sediment accretion trends, carbon dioxide emissions, and soil shear strength to examine differences among disappearing (Black Bank and Big Egg) and stable marshes (JoCo). Radiometric dating and nitrogen isotope analyses suggested a rapid increase in human wastewater nutrients beginning in the late 1840s, and a tapering off beginning in the 1930s when wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were first installed. Current WWTPs nutrient loads to Jamaica Bay are approximately 13 995 kg N/d and 2767 kg P/d. At Black Bank, the biomass and abundance of roots and rhizomes and percentage of organic matter on soil were significantly lower, rhizomes larger in diameter, carbon dioxide emission rates and peat particle density significantly greater, and soil strength significantly lower compared to the stable JoCo Marsh, suggesting Black Bank has elevated decomposition rates, more decomposed peat, and highly waterlogged peat. Despite these differences, the rates of accretion and surface elevation change were similar for both marshes, and the rates of elevation change approximated the long term relative rate of sea level rise estimated from tide gauge data at nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey. We hypothesize that Black Bank marsh kept pace with sea level rise by the accretion of material on the marsh surface, and the maintenance of soil volume through production of larger diameter rhizomes and swelling (dilation) of waterlogged peat. JoCo Marsh kept pace with sea-level rise through surface accretion and soil organic matter accumulation. Understanding the effects of multiple stressors, including nutrient enrichment, on soil structure, organic matter accumulation, and elevation change will better inform management decisions aimed at maintaining and restoring coastal marshes.

AB  - Results of a 12-yr study in an oligotrophic South Carolina salt marsh demonstrate that soil respiration increased by 795 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and that carbon inventories decreased in sediments fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus. Fertilized plots became net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, and sediment respiration continues in these plots at an accelerated pace. After 12 yr of treatment, soil macroorganic matter in the top 5 cm of sediment was 475 g C m(-2) lower in fertilized plots than in controls, which is equivalent to a constant loss rate of 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1). It is not known whether soil carbon in fertilized plots has reached a new equilibrium or continues to decline. The increase in soil respiration in the fertilized plots was far greater than the loss of sediment organic matter, which indicates that the increase in soil respiration was largely due to an increase in primary production. Sediment respiration in laboratory incubations also demonstrated positive effects of nutrients. Thus, the results indicate that increased nutrient loading of oligotrophic wetlands can lead to an increased rate of sediment carbon turnover and a net loss of carbon from sediments.

AB  - Saltmarshes are global hotspots of carbon sequestration and storage and are known as effective blue carbon ecosystems. However, the role of porewater exchange in saltmarshes as a source of carbon to the nearshore waters is still poorly constrained. Herein, we examined the radium quartet, dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in the porewater and nearshore surface water of Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh, China. Multiple methods based on the radium quartet were applied to estimate the porewater exchange, including the three-endmember model, mass balance model and time series observation. All methods revealed that the porewater exchange rate in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh equaled 3.37 +/- 1.23 cm d(-1). The porewater-derived DIC and DOC fluxes were then estimated to be (151 +/- 0.64) x 10(7) and (9.97 +/- 6.96) x 10(5) mol d(-1), respectively, which correspondingly made up 64.6% and 35.6%, of the total inputs into the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh nearshore water. Considering the intertidal area covered by saltmarsh vegetation, carbon export through the porewater exchange was 3.87 +/- 1.55 g C m(-2) d(-1), and was 1.2-fold greater than the carbon burial rate, accounting for approximately 29% of carbon outwelling in Chongming Dongtan saltmarsh. This study highlights the significance of porewater exchange for evaluating carbon sequestration capacity, and suggests that porewater exchange should not be overlooked in blue carbon assessments of saltmarshes.

AB  - Episodic deposition has been recognized as a major factor affecting the decomposition rate of detrital material in salt marshes. In this paper, three one-off burial treatments, no burial treatment (0 cm, NBT), current burial treatment (10 cm, CBT) and strong burial treatment (20 cm, SBT), were designed in intertidal zone of the Yellow River Estuary to determine the potential influences of episodic deposition on nutrient (C, N) and heavy metal (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn, Cd, V and Co) variations in decomposing litters ofSuaeda glauca. Results showed that although various burial treatments showed no statistical difference in decomposition rate ofS. glauca, the values generally followed the sequence of CBT (0.002 403/d) > SBT (0.002 195/d) > NBT (0.002 060/d). The nutrients and heavy metals in decomposing litters of the three burial treatments exhibited different variations except for N, Cu, Cr, Ni and Co. Except for Mn, no significant differences in C, N, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, V and Co concentrations occurred among the three treatments (P> 0.05). With increasing burial depth, Cr and Cd levels generally increased while Cu, Ni and Mn concentrations decreased. Although episodic deposition was generally favorable for C and N release fromS. glauca, its influence on release was insignificant. In the three burial treatments, Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co stocks inS. glaucagenerally evidenced the export of metals from litter to environment, and, with increasing burial depth, the export amounts increased greatly. TheS. glaucawere particular efficient in binding Cd and releasing Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co, and, with increasing burial depth, stocks of Cu in decomposing litters generally shifted from release to accumulation. The experiment indicated that the potential eco-toxic risk of Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mn, V and Co exposure would be serious as the strong burial episodes occurred inS. glaucamarsh.

AB  - The interaction between photochemical and biological processes in the degradation of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated with seawater from a coastal southeastern U.S. salt marsh. Seawater supplemented with humic substances was exposed to alternating cycles of sunlight (equivalent to 8 h of midday sun) and dark incubations with natural bacterial populations (1-2 weeks in length). Photochemical degradation of the DOM was monitored during sunlight exposure by direct measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and carbon monoxide (CO) formation in 0.2-mu m filtered seawater. Bacterial degradation was monitored during dark incubations by tritiated leucine uptake and changes in bacterial numbers in bacterivore-free incubations and by direct measurements of DOM loss. The alternating cycles of sunlight and microbial activity resulted in more complete degradation of bulk DOM and marine humic substances than was found for nonirradiated controls (i.e. with microbial activity alone) by a factor of up to 3-fold. Increased decomposition was due both to direct losses of carbon gas photoproducts (DIC and CO in a 15:1 ratio) and to enhanced microbial degradation of photodegraded DOM, with approximately equal contributions from each pathway. Mass balance calculations indicated that low-molecular-weight carbon photoproducts, currently considered to be the compounds responsible for stimulating bacterial activity following photodegradation of DOM, were insufficient to account for the enhanced bacterial production observed. Thus, higher molecular weight, chemically uncharacterized fractions of DOM may also be modified to more biologically available forms during exposure to natural sunlight.

AB  - The restoration and protection of "blue carbon" ecosystems - mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes - has potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions and improve coastal livelihoods. However, realisation of this potential relies on global investment in restoration and protection, which in turn relies on appropriate funding mechanisms that are currently impeded by multiple constraints. Constraints include commercial considerations by private investors (including reliable estimates of financial returns, risk quantification and management, and supply chain impacts), regulatory and legal uncertainty (such as the complexity of property rights in coastal areas, policy coordination across jurisdictions, and stable policy consistent with the duration of blue carbon projects). There are, however, opportunities to improve on current practices, including better stakeholder engagement (including social license to operate, and knowledge transfer to promote best practices), and targeted use of public and philanthropic funding (to subsidise demonstration projects, reduce financial risk through collaterals, and promote low-profit but high co-benefit projects). In this paper, a strategy for the realisation of potential benefits through commercially viable and scientifically robust blue carbon initiatives is presented alongside insights and guidance for the policy, research, civil society, and private sectors to achieve these important long-term outcomes.

AB  - Nutrient enrichment is a widespread phenomenon affecting coastal waters, including salt marshes. As land-derived nitrogen loading in estuarine waters increases, chlorophyll concentrations in the water also increase. We hypothesized that such increases might increase growth of the food-limited population of Geukensia demissa, which is a dominant component of salt marshes. To test this, we conducted a regional scale experiment in three estuaries of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts that receive different nitrogen loading rates. A stable isotope experiment on mussel tissues and on particulate organic matter (POM) showed that mussels within an estuary fed on POM characteristic of that estuary, demonstrating the direct linkage between POM and mussels within an estuary. In addition, we measured age-specific shell growth rates of mussel populations using two different methods: indirectly, shell growth of mussels indicated by internal shell-lines was measured by fitting the data to the von Bertalanffy equation, and directly, mussels were transplanted from one estuary to the other two, and their actual shell growth rates after 80 days were measured. Growth rates of mussels in the Waquoit Bay estuaries varied with age of the mussel, tidal elevation, and with mean concentration of chlorophyll in the water. Mussels grew best in the lower intertidal zone, at the marsh banks. Young mussels grew faster than older mussels. Growth rates increased in response to presumed greater food supply across the estuaries, only for younger mussels. The significant differences we found among the mussels from different estuaries indicate a response to higher concentrations of food particles available in estuaries subject to higher nitrogen loads.

AB  - In contrast to the large number of studies on the trophic significance of mangrove primary production to the aquatic foodweb, there have been few attempts to provide an overview of the relative importance of different primary carbon sources to invertebrates in the intertidal mangrove habitats. We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) in sediments, primary producers, and invertebrate species from an intertidal mangrove forest located along the southeast coast of India in order to determine the contribution of mangrove leaf litter and other carbon sources to the invertebrate community. Organic matter in sediments under the mangrove vegetation was characterized by relatively high delta(13)C values and low C:N ratios, indicating that mangrove-derived organic matter was not the principal source and that imported phytodetritus from the mangrove creeks and adjacent bay significantly contributed to the sediment organic matter pool. Invertebrates were found to display a wide range of delta(13)C values, most being 3-11parts per thousand enriched relative to the average mangrove leaf signal. The pulmonate gastropod Onchidium sp. showed unusually low delta(15)N values (-5.6+/-0.9parts per thousand), but further work is needed to adequately explain these data. A compilation of stable isotope data from various sources indicates that significant assimilation of mangrove-derived carbon is only detectable in a limited number of species, and suggests that local and imported algal sources are a major source of carbon for benthic invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests. These results provide new insights into carbon utilization patterns in vegetated tropical intertidal habitats and show a striking similarity with results from temperate salt marsh ecosystems where local plant production has often been found to contribute little to intertidal foodwebs.

AB  - Ecosystem establishment under adverse geophysical conditions is often studied within the "windows of opportunity" framework, identifying disturbance-free periods (e.g., calm wave climate) where species can overcome establishment thresholds. However, the role of biogeophysical interactions in this framework is less well understood. The establishment of saltmarsh vegetation on tidal flats, for example, is limited by abiotic factors such as hydrodynamics, sediment stability and drainage. On tidal flats, raised sediment ridges colonized by algal mats (Vaucheria sp.) appear to accomodate high densities of plant seedlings. Such ridges were previously found to have higher sediment strength than substratum without algae. Here, we investigate whether these measurements can be explained by geophysical factors only, or that biological (Vaucheria-induced) processes influence tidal marsh establishment by forming stabilized bedforms. We performed two experiments under controlled mesocosm conditions, to test the hypotheses that (a) Vaucheria grows better on elevated topographic relief, that (b) the binding force of their algal filaments increases sediment strength, and that (c) Vaucheria consequently creates elevated topographic relief that further facilitates algal growth. Our experimental results confirm the existence of this algal-induced biogeomorphic feedback cycle. These findings imply that benthic algae like Vaucheria may contribute significantly to tidal marsh formation by creating elevated and stabilized substratum. This suggests biogeophysical feedbacks can "widen" the windows of opportunity for further ecosystem establishment. Our results could be useful for the design of managed realignment projects aimed at restoring the unique ecosystem services of coastal wetlands, such as habitat biodiversity, carbon sequestration potential and nature-based flood defense.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have the potential to accumulate C at high rates over long time periods because they continuously accrete and bury organic-rich sediments, giving soils in coastal wetlands a distinct advantage over many other environments in the sequestration of organic C. Given that coastal wetlands are being lost worldwide, it is important to understand their C sequestration potential. Sediments in a southern California, USA coastal lagoon-wetland complex were cored, and depositional environments were interpreted. Suitable materials were radiocarbon dated. Bulk density and organic C were grouped by depositional environments, and average mass of C per unit volume and C accumulation rates in each depositional environment were calculated. The total organic C sequestered and rates of sequestration in each depositional environment were in the following order from most (fastest) to least (slowest): lagoon, intertidal, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, aeolian. This study demonstrated that high levels of organic C are sequestered per unit volume of sediment (35.9 +/- 3.2 kg m(-3)), and the mean rate of C accumulation was high (0.033 +/- 0.0029 kg C m(-2) year(-1)) over a long time period (5000 years). Results of this study strongly demonstrate the importance and necessary high priority for preserving and restoring coastal wetlands both in the USA and internationally. However, despite their excellent potential to sequester C, significant losses of coastal wetlands are occurring in the United States and elsewhere in the world. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Meiofaunal investigations of Bhitarkanika mangrove sediments revealed the presence of 11 major faunal taxa, of which nematodes were the dominant. Higher densities (no.1 m(-2)) of meiofauna were observed in low water mark (143.68 cm(-2)) and mid water mark (119.2 cm(-2)) at 0-5 cm depth. A positive correlation between meiofaunal densisties and median sorted sediments with high organic matter was observed. Harpacticoid copepod density (28.74 cm(-2)) was found to be 2 times higher than that reported for salt marsh. However, nematodes (108.78 cm(-2)) showed lower densities than those reported for other estuarine habitats.

AB  - Non-seagrass sources account for similar to 50% of the sediment organic carbon (SOC) in many seagrass beds, a fraction that may derive from external organic matter (OM) advected into the meadow and trapped by the seagrass canopy or produced in situ. If allochthonous carbon fluxes are responsible for the non-seagrass SOC in a given seagrass bed, this fraction should decrease with distance from the meadow perimeter. Identifying the spatial origin of SOC is important for closing seagrass carbon budgets and "blue carbon" offset-credit accounting, but studies have yet to quantify and map seagrass SOC stocks by carbon source. We measured sediment delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 throughout a large (6 km(2)), restored Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadow and applied Bayesian mixing models to quantify total SOC contributions from possible autotroph sources, Z. marina, Spartina alterniflora, and benthic microalgae (BMA). Z. marina accounted for < 40% of total meadow SOC, but we did not find evidence for outwelling from the fringing S. alterniflora salt-marsh or OM advection from bare subtidal areas. S. alterniflora SOC contributions averaged 10% at sites both inside and outside of the meadow. The BMA fraction accounted for 51% of total meadow SOC and was highest at sites furthest from the bare subtidal-meadow edge, indicative of in situ production. Pb-210 profiles confirmed that meadow-enhanced sedimentation facilitates the burial of in situ BMA. Deducting this contribution from total SOC would underestimate total organic carbon fixation within the meadow. Seagrass meadows can enhance BMA burial, which likely accounts for most of the non-seagrass SOC stored in many seagrass beds.

AB  - Building up a scenario of Late Pleistocene-Holocene environmental change and human-landscape interactions in Central Mexico - one of the key areas for the natural and cultural history of America - requires development of local paleoenvironmental reconstructions. We studied the Tepexpan section at the edge of Texcoco a paleolake, near the mouth of Teotihuacan Valley as a multiproxy record of the environmental dynamics at the shore in the Basin of Mexico throughout the period of human occupation. The section is located in an ecotone affected by intensive and variable geomorphic processes and includes lacustrine, fluvial and volcanic sediments as well as paleosols. Our chronological scale is based on 6 AMS C-14 dates from pollen concentrates and paleosol organic matter. The lower segment of the section dominated by the lacustrine sediments yielded pollen spectra; in the upper segment the record is based on the pedogenetic characteristics of paleosols. Different proxies agree in demonstrating the general trend (although some reversals are apparent) of decreasing effective moisture since MIS3: it is reflected first in the increase of herbaceous pollen after 27 ka BP, the decrease of lake level, the cessation of lacustrine sedimentation and beginning of marsh soil development at 10 ka BP and finally, the shift from hydromorphic to dryland semiarid pedogenesis in the late Holocene. We assume that this trend was climatically controlled, whereas the deposition of sedimentary layers enriched with tephra are related to the pulses of volcanic activity; the pedosedimentary features associated with the upper soil are human-induced. Comparing the proposed scheme of environmental change with the archaeological record we propose that the initial settlers, Late Paleolithic hunters, could have utilized the wet swampy meadows which expanded on the Basin bottom as the lake level lowered and provided the niche for large herbivores during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Development of agriculture and the network of permanent settlements are believed to be linked to the formation of well drained soils. In the methodological perspective the study shows the potential of ecotones as highly dynamic and sensitive systems that may archive valuable paleoecological records. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vertical accretion of impounded marsh and adjacent natural marsh at four sites in southwestern Louisiana was estimated in 1994 by determining the depth of a stratum containing Cs-137 deposited in 1963. With relative marsh elevation, soil bulk density, organic matter content, and organic and mineral matter accumulation rates were used to describe soil formation. Three sites were impounded in 1956 and one site in 1951. Impounded marshes had lower marsh surface elevation than natural marshes because of hydrologic isolation from tidal sediment subsidies and substrate oxidation during forced drying. The elevation of natural marshes ranged from 12 cm to 42 cm higher than the elevation of the impounded marshes in 1963 and from 20 cm to 32 cm higher in 1994. Vertical accretion between 1963 and 1994 ranged from 9 cm to 28 cm in impounded marsh and from 15 cm to 21.5 cm in natural marsh. Only in impounded marsh that remained permanently flooded was accretion greater than in natural marsh.

AB  - The paper focuses on an interpretation of sedimentary and early diagenetic environment in the carbonate-dominated uppermost Ladinian-Norian succession from the Tatricum domain of the Tatra Mountains as well as its controlling factors. Limestones with cherts are the product of pedogcnic processes, formed during long-term exposures of carbonate substrate. Chalcedony cherts were formed during relatively early diagenesis of pedogenic limestones. Dolostones and dolomitic mudstones were deposited in a kind of salt marshes. Pseudomorphs after sulfates and absence of benthic fauna indicate increased salinity and intensive evaporation. Additionally, low TOC concentration suggests a low productivity in the basin. On the contrary, stable isotope signals indicate that the sedimentary environment was strongly affected by meteoric water. Moreover, delta(18)O and concentration of Sr suggest that dolostones were formed under the influence of both marine and meteoric waters. Dolomitic mudstones could be deposited in a salt-marsh environment fed by distal sheet floods. Components of palynological material and organic compounds in black dolomitic mudstones indicate the terrestrial origin of organic matter. Dolomitic regoliths were formed as the result of subaerial exposure and karstification of dolostones. Coarse-grained siliciclastics and variegated mudstone are interpreted, respectively, as a fluvial channel and flood plain facies of ephemeric fluvial environment. Sedimentary environment of the Keuper sediments was controlled by two main factors: synsedimentary tectonic movements and climate changes. In the latest Ladinian, the Middle Triassic carbonate platform was emerged, what resulted in the development of palaeosols. Block tectonic movements affected the Tatricum Basin in Keuper time. Horsts were emerged, whereas troughs were filled with fluvial or salt marsh sediments. Intensive tectonic movements are suggested by seismic-generated slumps and abrupt facies changes. More intensive chemical weathering and intensive contribution of pure siliciclastics suggest climate pluvialization in late Ladinian early Carnian time. On the contrary, domination of physical weathering indicates the aridization of climate in late Carnian?-Norian time. The upper Carnian?-Norian succession was formed in hot and semi-arid climate conditions. Long-term climate changes was masked by short-term climate fluctuations. Geochemical indicators suggest that dolostones represent more humid periods, whereas dolomitic mudstones relatively dry periods.

AB  - Plants of saline habitats can encounter anoxic conditions to extents which vary with habitat and life form. Rhizophytes (with roots or rhizoids in a sediment) routinely have anoxia or hypoxia in their roots, rhizoids and rhizomes. Haptophytes (attached to large particles of substrate) and planophytes (unattached) are generally less prone to anoxia or hypoxia, exceptions being ice-encased polar haptophytes and estuarine and muddy shore macroscopic planophytes (pleustophytes) which can become hypoxic or anoxic as a result of burial in sediment or under new growth.
   A major difference between anoxia in low-salinity habitats and anoxia in saline habitats is the presence of high sulphate concentrations in most saline habitats including seawater. Use of sulphate as electron acceptor in microbial oxidation or organic carbon produces sulphide, with relatively less production of methane than in anoxic habitats with lower sulphate concentrations. In addition to its role as a toxin, S-34/S-32 natural abundance data show that S-34-depleted sulphide is directly or indirectly used as a sulphur source for roots and rhizomes of seagrasses and for the whole organism of emergent salt marsh herbs. and mangroves. Granted the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the rhizosphere. its entry by lipid-solution permeation of the plasmalemma is inevitable. The balance of evidence favours the entry of hydrogen sulphide rather than the oxidation of S-34-depleted sulphide to S-34-depleted sulphate in an aerobic rhizosphere with subsequent entry of sulphate.

AB  - The link between anthropogenically modified nutrient loading and coastal wetland stability is not well understood due to limited data from long-term experiments and inconsistent findings from investigations thus far. In this study, we present results from a 13-year oligohaline marsh fertilization experiment aimed at determining whether eutrophic conditions compromise ecosystem stability, defined here as the capacity to keep pace with sea level rise and resist the erosive forces of high-energy meteorologic events. To accomplish this objective, we measured soil surface elevation change and soil shear strength, along with a suite of regulatory processes that included belowground standing crop, belowground decomposition, organic and mineral matter accumulation, soil accretion, and shallow subsidence. Our results identified an apparent compensatory effect of nutrient enrichment on accretionary processes whereby shallow subsidence, attributed to reduced live root standing crop, was balanced by enhanced accretion resulting from greater organic matter accumulation at the soil surface. Consequently, the rate of marsh elevation change measured over a five-year period was unaffected after more than a decade of experimental nutrient enrichment. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the soil matrix did not deteriorate under elevated nutrient conditions; decomposition rates were similar to control plots, and although live root standing crop was reduced, the root system was evidently stronger, as soil strength tended to increase rather than decrease after nutrients were provided for 13 years. Our data suggest that enhanced nutrient loading is an unlikely destabilizing mechanism in this coastal marsh and possibly others. However, additional long-term research will be required in a diverse range of habitats and environmental settings before broad-based, general conclusions concerning the effects of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland stability can be made with a high degree of certainty.

AB  - The estuary of the Palmones River is a small, shallow and eutrophic system, located in the South of Spain. Presently, it is dominated by the fast-growing macroalgae Ulva rotundata Bliding and Enteromorpha prolifera J.G. Agardh, which respond efficiently to extreme nutrient input. The influence of macrophytes on phosphorus accumulation in sediment, over a long time-scale, was studied in this work. Different fractions of bound phosphorus were measured in four types of sediment: bare sediment (acting as control), sediment with Ulva, sediment with Enteromorpha, and sediment with Sarcocornia perennis perennis (L.) A.J. Scott, a chenopodiacean living on the border of the salt marsh. The results show that ulvaceans favour phosphorus storage in the sediment, throughout the settling of easily degradable organic matter and the subsequent retention of the phosphate being released from the sediment.

AB  - In 1980, Scott Nixon reviewed the role of salt marshes in estuarine and coastal productivity. His review was effectively a progress report on the testing of "The Outwelling Hypothesis" (Odum, 1980). Nixon (1980) signaled a crucial turning point in the direction of estuarine flux studies conducted since then. In this review we revisit Nixon (1980), focusing on research and thinking that has been guided by The Outwelling Concept in the last two decades. Since 1980, estuarine flux studies have been conducted at 41 different sites and presented in over 42 publications. More than a third of these were conducted in Europe, Africa, Australia, or Mexico. Our review of these studies highlighted several important advances. The first was evolution of a conceptual approach that decomposes the estuary-coastal ocean landscape into interacting subsystems (i.e., the coastal ocean, estuarine basins, and marsh). Most post-1980 flux studies have addressed interactions between these individual subsystems, often in an hierarchical sense. Over half of these quantified exchanges between marsh-dominated basins and the greater estuary-generally through a single, well-defined tidal channel. From these data, we found that tidal range, subsystem area, and distance to the ocean together explained 87% of the variability in total organic carbon (TOC) exchanges and 92% of the variability in total suspended solids (TSS) fluxes, with exports occurring at lower tidal ranges, areas, and distances. Tidal range explained 40% of the variability in nitrate + nitrite (NN) exchange (with uptake at ranges below about 1.2 m and export at greater tidal ranges) and 39% of available phosphorus (SRP) flux variation (with export at ranges below about 1.6 m), We were unable to extract similar relationships from whole-estuary exchange studies because so few exist. The geomorphological setting and degree of ecological maturity (analogous to geologic age) of a marsh or basin within an estuary are important controllers of ecological function, thus flux behavior, We applied concepts of community succession and ecosystem development to data from marsh-water column Aux studies, and found that slope of Aux vs. tidal height relationships was greater for younger marshes compared to all marshes, and much greater for younger marshes compared to older marshes. This change in slope often caused a shift in the inflection point that indicated the tidal range at which export shifted to import, or vice verse, These studies quantified surficial fluxes, though, and a number of post-1980 studies demonstrated the importance of other processes, including subsurface flow, subtidal advection, and the movement of nutrients and organic matter by animals (other chapters in this volume address these precesses), Finally, a number of studies showed strong controls on fluxes by exogenous environmental forcing, and we reviewed several studies that used innovative budgeting and modeling of Aux dynamics and ecological precesses to incorporate these sources of variability. Since 1980 we have learned a great deal more about how estuarine wetlands interact with their estuaries, and of the value of establishing a conceptual framework and system boundaries. Estuarine ecologists have learned a great deal about outwelling as a concept although few flux studies have directly addressed the original Outwelling Hypothesis.
   We suggest that the question should not be "Is The Outwelling Hypothesis true?" but rather: 1) how are materials being exchanged between different subsystems in estuary-coastal ocean landscapes? 2) what are the mechanisms of this exchange? and 3) how do exogenous forcings control these patterns of exchange? Estuarine scientists are encouraged to view The Outwelling Hypothesis as a conceptual stimulus of ideas and not as a strict statistical hypothesis that must be proven or disproven.

AB  - Mangrove wetland restoration and creation efforts are increasingly proposed as mechanisms to compensate for mangrove wetland losses. However, ecosystem development and functional equivalence in restored and created mangrove wetlands are poorly understood. We compared a 20-year chronosequence of created tidal wetland sites in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) to natural reference mangrove wetlands. Across the chronosequence, our sites represent the succession from salt marsh to mangrove forest communities. Our results identify important soil and plant structural differences between the created and natural reference wetland sites; however, they also depict a positive developmental trajectory for the created wetland sites that reflects tightly coupled plant-soil development. Because upland soils and/or dredge spoils were used to create the new mangrove habitats, the soils at younger created sites and at lower depths (10-30 cm) had higher bulk densities, higher sand content, lower soil organic matter (SOM), lower total carbon (TC), and lower total nitrogen (TN) than did natural reference wetland soils. However, in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm), SOM, TC, and TN increased with created wetland site age simultaneously with mangrove forest growth. The rate of created wetland soil C accumulation was comparable to literature values for natural mangrove wetlands. Notably, the time to equivalence for the upper soil layer of created mangrove wetlands appears to be faster than for many other wetland ecosystem types. Collectively, our findings characterize the rate and trajectory of above- and below-ground changes associated with ecosystem development in created mangrove wetlands; this is valuable information for environmental managers planning to sustain existing mangrove wetlands or mitigate for mangrove wetland losses.

AB  - Stable isotopes have been used to quantify the contributions of plant-derived detritus in nutrient cycling and energy flow based on the assumption that mixtures reflect the isotopic composition of their sources. However, during the decay process, the plant detritus carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures may vary from that of the original plant material. This fractionation during plant decomposition may impose limitations on the interpretation of results based on the stable isotopes approach. Studies investigating this process for estuarine primary producers have shown contrasting results, and for some producers, they are still scarce. The present study investigated the temporal variations in the elemental (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N ratios) and isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) compositions of C-3 and C-4 salt marsh plants (Scitpus maritimus and Spartina densiflora, respectively), seagrass (Ruppia maritima) and opportunistic macroalgae (Rhizoclonium sp.) during decomposition. For this purpose, an in situ experiment using litterbag incubations was conducted in a shallow water ( < 2 m) estuarine site over twelve weeks to investigate the plant decomposition process under the natural variability of environmental conditions (i.e., freshwater discharge, dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, water salinity and temperature). Our results indicated that detritus biomass and nutrient mineralization rates varied among the different estuarine plant species. Overall decreases in the C:N ratios primarily resulted from total organic carbon losses. However, low variations in delta C-13 ( < 2 parts per thousand) were detected, possibly due to the short-term duration of our study. The observed lack of significant changes in total nitrogen content and the small changes in N-15 values during plant material degradation suggests, to some extent, N-limitation of microbial growth. The observed low levels of isotopic fractionation during decomposition support the usefulness of stable isotopes as natural tracers of organic matter. Nonetheless, to investigate the effects of several environmental and biotic factors on nutrient isotopic fractionation during plant decay and their implications for ecological studies, we emphasize the need for further experimental studies performed under distinct environmental conditions.

AB  - Coastal wetlands mainly include ecosystems of mangroves, coral reefs, salt marsh, and sea grass beds. As the buffer zone between land and sea, they are frequently threatened from both sides. The world coastal wetland lost more than 50% of its area in the 20th century, largely before their great value, such as wave attenuation, erosion control, biodiversity support, and carbon sequestration, was fully recognized. World wetland loss and degradation was accelerated in the last three decades, caused by both anthropogenic and natural factors, such as land reclamation, aquaculture, urbanization, harbor and navigation channel construction, decreased sediment input from the catchments, sea level rise, and erosion. Aquaculture is one of the key destinations of coastal wetland transformation. Profound consequences have been caused by coastal wetland loss, such as habitat loss for wild species, CO2 and N2O emission from land reclamation and aquaculture, and flooding. Great efforts have been made to restore coastal wetlands, but challenges remain due to lack of knowledge about interactions between vegetation and morphological dynamics. Compromise among the different functionalities remains a challenge during restoration of coastal wetlands, especially when faced with highly profitable coastal land use. To solve the problem, multi-disciplinary efforts are needed from physio-chemical-biological monitoring to modelling, designing, and restoring practices with site-specific knowledge.

AB  - Wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units, and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on SOC mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies. Soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanent floodplain F0, 1-year floodplain F1, 5-year floodplain F5, 10-year flood plain F10, and 100-year floodplain F100) in the downstream of the Huolin River basin of China. A 30-day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments (i.e., 30%, 60%, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)) was used to identify SOC mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands. Our results showed that the topsoils (0-10 cm) contained significantly higher SOC contents than the subsurface soils (10-20 cm). The SOC contents followed the order of F5 > F0 > F1 > F10 > F100 and the order FO > F5 > F100 > F1 > F10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils, respectively, of five floodplain wetlands. The optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization of the topsoils was 30% WHC in F100, and 60% WHC in the other four wetlands. In the case of all the subsurface soils, 30% WHC was the optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization. The mineralization processes of SOC (especially the active carbon pool) could be better fitted by first-order kinetic models (R-2 > 0.98). The topsoils basically showed a lower C-0/SOC ratio (C-0: the potentially mineralized carbon) than the subsurface soils, except in the case of 60% and 100% WHC in F0 and F5. Under higher soil moisture conditions, the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity (p < 0.05). Under low soil moisture condition, C-0/SOC showed significant correlations with soil pH (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are sites of rapid carbon (C) sequestration and contain large soil C stocks. Thus, there is increasing interest in those ecosystems as sites for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission offset projects (sometimes referred to as "Blue Carbon"), through preservation of existing C stocks or creation of new wetlands to increase future sequestration. Here we show that in the globally-widespread occurrence of diked, impounded, drained and tidally-restricted salt marshes, substantial methane (CH4) and CO2 emission reductions can be achieved through restoration of disconnected saline tidal flows. Modeled climatic forcing indicates that tidal restoration to reduce emissions has a much greater impact per unit area than wetland creation or conservation to enhance sequestration. Given that GHG emissions in tidally-restricted, degraded wetlands are caused by human activity, they are anthropogenic emissions, and reducing them will have an effect on climate that is equivalent to reduced emission of an equal quantity of fossil fuel GHG. Thus, as a landuse-based climate change intervention, reducing CH4 emissions is an entirely distinct concept from biological C sequestration projects to enhance C storage in forest or wetland biomass or soil, and will not suffer from the non-permanence risk that stored C will be returned to the atmosphere.

AB  - High sedimentation rates along river-dominated margins make these systems important repositories for organic carbon derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. Using elemental carbon/nitrogen ratios, molecular biomarker (lignin phenol), and stable carbon isotopic (bulk and compound-specific) analyses, this study examined the sources of organic carbon to the Louisiana shelf within one of the primary dispersive pathways of the Mississippi River. Surface sediment samples were collected from stations across the inner, mid, and outer Louisiana shelf, within the Mississippi River plume region, during two cruises in the spring and fall of 2000. Lignin biomarker data showed spatial patterns in terrestrial source plant materials within the river plume, such that sediments near the mouth of the Mississippi River were comparatively less degraded and richer in C-4 plant carbon than those found at mid-depth regions of the shelf. A molecular and stable isotope-based mixing model defining riverine, marsh, and marine organic carbon suggested that the highest organic carbon inputs to the shelf in spring were from marine sources (55-61% marine organic carbon), while riverine organic carbon was the highest (63%) in fall, likely due to lower inputs of marine organic carbon at this time compared with the spring season. This model also indicated that marsh inputs, ranging from 19 to 34% and 3-15% of the organic carbon in spring and fall, respectively, were significantly more important sources of organic carbon on the inner Louisiana shelf than previously suggested. Finally, we propose that the decomposition of terrestrial-derived organic carbon (from the river and local wetlands sources) in mobile muds may serve as a largely unexplored additional source of oxygen-consuming organic carbon in hypoxic bottom waters of the Louisiana shelf.

AB  - The distribution of benthic foraminifera, a range of elements, and. Cs-137 and Pb-210 were studied in surface sediments and 0.5 m cores from the Plentzia estuarine marshes (northern Spain) to determine the recent development of these previously reclaimed coastal areas. These marshes receive abundant calcium carbonate from regional rocks and this allows calcareous foraminifera to colonize all marsh sub environments. Good preservation of the original foraminiferal assemblages in the buried sediments is also favoured by high regional background carbonate. Benthic foraminifera are shown to be sensitive to both elevation above mean sea level (exposure) and salinity. Results from the chemical analyses indicate moderate anthropogenic pollution in the estuary, and maximum input seems to have occurred in the 1960s. Recent marsh foraminiferal assemblages are good analogues for the palaeo environmental interpretation of historical and Holocene cores, and the combined micropalaeontological/geochemical approach is demonstrated to be successful for the identification of short-term anthropogenic impacts on this coastal region.

AB  - Seasonal and spatial variation of dissolved and atmospheric methane (CH4) was measured in the estuaries of the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem from January to December 2003. This unique mangrove forest ecosystem (9630 km(2)), a part of the Hooghly-Matia estuarine system (NE coast of Bay of Bengal) comprises about 3% of the total area of the world's mangroves. Dissolved methane concentrations in the mangrove dominated estuarine water (Muriganga, Saptamukhi and Thakuran) were observed between 11.0 and 129.0 nmol L-1 with emission rates between 1.97 and 134.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Methane emission showed maximum rate during post-monsoon when phytoplankton reached blooming proportion. During post-rnonsoon materials transported from the mangrove forest could stimulate phytoplankton bloom when transparency of water column was increased and river input of nutrient was low. However, dissolved methane concentrations in the Hooghly estuary, the main river water flushing channel showed lower values between 10.3 and 59.25 nmol L-1 with emission rates between 0.88 and 148.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). Methane concentrations in the salinity gradient zone of the Hooghly estuary did not show any decreasing trend with increased salinity due to its lateral transport from the mangrove forest situated at the lower stretch of the estuary. Dissolved methane concentration in the pore water collected from the virgin mangrove forest showed a maximum concentration of 5769 nmol L-1 which was considerably lower compared to that of coastal salt marsh, tidal fresh water wetland. This indicated intense oxidation or out competition of methanogenic bacteria by sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria. Methane emission from the adjacent forest ecosystem (18.36 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was higher compared to that in the mangrove water. Considering methane emission rates from the aquatic and forest ecosystems, an area average rate of 47.28 x 10(5) mol km(-2) yr(-1) for Sundarban mangrove environment was obtained. Extrapolating over the global area covered by mangrove forest with area average soil methane emission rate without considering its emission from water could yield inaccurate estimation.

AB  - The Yellow River Delta wetland is the most integrated, broadest, youngest wetland ecological system in China. Due to the affection by human activities, the wetland is under a degraded risk and urgently require for ecological restoration. Moreover, the wetland is an influenced and responsive region of global change because of its unique water-heat effect and greenhouse gas metabolic process. In this study, five typical salt marsh plant communities were selected to study the characteristics of greenhouse gas emission of the wetland. The results indicated that the greenhouse gas emission, especially for the CO2 and CH4, showed a distinctly spatial variation. The sample site (HW4) discharged the maximum emissions concentration of CH4 and CO2, reaching 691.6 and 1.32 mg/m(3) in the static opaque chamber, respectively. The total annual emissions of CH4 and CO2 were approximately 1.20 x 10(4) t a(-1) and 18.4 x 10(4) t a(-1) in the five plant communities. It was also found that the relationship of the soil moisture to CH4 emissions was positive correlation, but that to CO2 emissions was negative correlation. In addition, there was a linear correlation (y = 0.0196x + 0.0252, R-2 = 0.9872) between the content of Fe and Mn in the soil. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Controls on organic matter cycling across the tidal wetland-estuary interface have proved elusive, but high-resolution observations coupled with process-based modeling can be a powerful methodology to address shortcomings in either methodology alone. In this study, detailed observations and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling are used to examine biogeochemical exchanges in the marsh-estuary system of the Rhode River, MD, USA. Analysis of observations near the marsh in 2015 reveals a strong relationship between marsh creek salinity and dissolved organic matter fluorescence (fDOM), with wind velocity indirectly driving large amplitude variation of both salinity and fDOM at certain times of the year. Three-dimensional model results from the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model implemented for the wetland system with a new marsh grass drag module are consistent with observations, simulating sub-tidal variability of marsh creek salinity. The model results exhibit an interaction between wind-driven variation in surface elevation and flow velocity at the marsh creek, with northerly winds driving increased freshwater signal and discharge out of the modeled wetland during precipitation events. Wind setup of a water surface elevation gradient axially along the estuary drives the modeled local sub-tidal flow and thus salinity variability. On sub-tidal time scales (> 36 h, < 1 week), wind is important in mediating dissolved organic matter releases from the Kirkpatrick Marsh into the Rhode River.

AB  - Sources and distribution of particulate organic matter in surface waters of the Humber and Thames estuaries and in the East Anglian plume in the southern North Sea were investigated in winter 2006/2007. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes provided evidence for the presence of three particulate organic matter sources; riverine plankton (delta C-13 -30 aEuro degrees and delta N-15 7.9 aEuro degrees) identified in the Thames estuary only, marine plankton (average delta C-13 -21.4 aEuro degrees and delta N-15 4.5 aEuro degrees) and a third source with an enriched C-13 signature (>-16.7 aEuro degrees) and elevated C:N ratio (> 12.7). Particulate organic matter with enriched C-13 values were observed throughout the Humber estuary and at the marine end-member of the Thames estuary. While bacterial cycling of organic carbon undoubtedly takes place within these estuaries, these processes on their own are unlikely to account for the isotopic signatures seen. The C-13 enriched organic matter source is suggested to be due to particulate organic matter input from marsh plants and seagrasses such as Spartina spp. and Zostera on the adjacent salt marshes and mudflats and/or macroalgae along the banks of the estuaries. This C-13 enriched signal was also identified approximately 50 km offshore within the southern North Sea, in the East Anglian plume, which transports UK riverine water off-shore in a discrete plume. This plume therefore provides a mechanism to transport this estuarine derived organic matter pool offshore out of the estuaries. These results indicate that estuarine derived organic matter from marsh plants, seagrasses and/or macroalgae contributes to the southern North Sea organic matter pool and is therefore likely to contribute to winter-time shelf sea carbon and nitrogen cycles.

AB  - Soil and water samples were analysed for trace metals and As in two watercourses and 14 sampling plots in a salt marsh polluted by mine wastes in SE Spain. Groundwater levels, soil pH and Eh were measured 'in situ' for a 12-month period in each sampling plot, and total calcium carbonate was also determined. Low concentrations of soluble metals (maximum Mn 1.089 mg L-1 and maximum Zn 0.553 mg L-1) were found in the watercourses. However, total metal contents were extremely high in the soils of a zone of the salt marsh (maximum 1,933 mg kg(-1) of Mn, 62,280 mg kg(-1) of Zn, 16,845 mg kg(-1) of Pb, 77 mg kg(-1) of Cd, 418 mg kg(-1) of Cu and 725 mg kg(-1) of As), and soluble metals in the pore water reached 38.7 mg L-1 for Zn, 3.15 mg L-1 for Pb, 48.0 mg L-1 for Mn, 0.61 mg L-1 for Cd and 0.29 mg L-1 for As. Variable concentrations with depth indicate a possible re-mobilisation of the metals, which could be related to spatial and temporal variations of water table level, pH and Eh and to the presence of calcium carbonate. A tendency for the Eh to decrease in the warmest months and to increase in the coldest ones was found, especially, in plots that received water with a high content of dissolved organic carbon. Hence, the existence of nutrient effluent-enriched water may modify the physical-chemical conditions of the soil-water system and influence metal mobility.

AB  - Ammonium regeneration was studied in sediments collected from two stations located in Concepcion Bay, Chile, a semi-enclosed and shallow system. This system is under the effects of the coastal upwelling processes for about 57% of every year. To understand the importance of the benthic system in ammonium dynamics, quantification is required of, at least, detrital inputs (with sediment traps), ammonium recycling rates (using experimental incubations of intact sediment cores), and ammonium loss through burial in the sediment column. The mean annual ammonium flux of 3.41 mmol m(-2) day(-1) is comparable to the estimated benthic flux in very high productivity areas. The sediment thus constitutes an important ammonium source for the water column with respect to other sources, such as inputs from salt marshes, rivers and shelf waters. Seasonal variation in ammonium fluxes reflects the seasonality in macrofaunal activity, detrital inputs to the sediment-water interface, and the oxygen content of bottom water. These variables are enhanced in summer and may be an effect of the upwelling process. Ammonium benthic flux measurements and calculated burial rates are utilized to estimate the nitrogen budget of the sediments in the two stations studied. Approximately 76-83% of total nitrogen is regenerated as a product of the remineralization of organic matter produced during upwelling events which settles onto anoxic sediment.

To reveal the phenomenons and mechanisms of salinity and moisture effects, we conducted a 30-days laboratory experiment with different salt addition levels (0, ppt, 5 ppt and 35 ppt) and moisture levels (10%, 50% and 100% of water holding capacity (WHC)), and the key N transformation rates and enzymes activities were measured. Our results showed that during the incubation, the rates of soil net nitrogen mineralization (R-min) and nitrification (Rint) under all treatments, increased during 0-1 day, decreased during 1-3 days, then increased and kept around zero. As incubation time increased, urease activities increased, arylamidase activities decreased and fluorescein diacetate activities increased first and then decreased. Increasing salinity under high moisture (100% WHC) treatments and increasing moisture under high salinity (35 ppt) treatments would promote R-min and R-nit. Whereas, increasing salinity under low moisture (10% WHC) treatments, and increasing moisture under low salinity (0 ppt) treatments would suppress R-min and R-nit. The responses of enzyme activities to salinity and moisture gradients almost correspond with R-min, indicating salinity and moisture could affect N transformation by the regulation of related microbial enzyme activities.

AB  - Annually integrated air-water CO2 flux data in 44 coastal environments were compiled from literature. Data were gathered in 8 major ecosystems (inner estuaries, outer estuaries, whole estuarine systems, mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs, upwelling systems, and open continental shelves), and up-scaled in the first attempt to integrate air-water CO2 fluxes over the coastal ocean (26 x 10(6) km(2)), taking into account its geographical and ecological diversity. Air-water CO2 fluxes were then up-scaled in global ocean (362 x 10(6) km(2)) using the present estimates for the coastal ocean and those from Takahashi et al. (2002) for the open ocean (336 x 106 km(2)). If estuaries and salt marshes are not taken into consideration in the up-scaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a sink for atmospheric CO2 (-1.17 Mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the global ocean increases by 24% (-1.93 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). The inclusion of the coastal ocean increases the estimates of CO2 uptake by the global ocean by 57% for high latitude areas (-0.44 versus -0.28 Pg C yr(-1)) and by 15% for temperate latitude areas (-2.36 versus -2.06 Pg C yr(-1)). At subtropical and tropical latitudes, the contribution from the coastal ocean increases the CO2 emission to the atmosphere from the global ocean by 13% (0.87 versus 0.77 Pg C yr(-1)). If estuaries and salt marshes are taken into consideration in the upscaling, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 (0.38 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 from the global ocean decreases by 12% (-1.44 versus -1.56 Pg C yr(-1)). At high and subtropical and tropical latitudes, the coastal ocean behaves as a source for atmospheric CO2 but at temperate latitudes, it still behaves as a moderate CO2 sink. A rigorous tip-scaling of air-water CO2 fluxes in the coastal ocean is hampered by the poorly constrained estimate of the surface area of inner estuaries. The present estimates clearly indicate the significance of this biogeochemicatly. highly active region of the biosphere in the global CO2 cycle.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured in the surf zone at 13 bathing beaches in Southern California, USA. Summer dry season concentrations averaged 122 +/- 38 nM with beaches with tide pools having lower levels (50-90 nM). No significant differences were observed for ebb waters at a salt marsh outlet vs. a beach (179 +/- 20 vs. 163 +/- 26 nM), and between ebb and flood tides at one site (171 +/- 24 vs. 146 +/- 42 nM). H2O2 levels showed little annual variation. Diel cycling was followed over short (30 min; 24 h study) and long (d) time scales, with maximum afternoon concentration = 370 nM and estimated photochemical production rate of 44 nM h(-1). There was no correlation between the absorbance coefficient at 300 nm (used as a measure of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) levels) and H2O2. H2O2 concentrations measured in this study are likely sufficient to inhibit fecal indicator bacteria in marine recreational waters through indirect photoinactivation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Estuaries present high content of chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM, FDOM) affecting the attenuation of ultraviolet and blue radiation. In temperate and tropical estuaries, the main CDOM source is riverine input that generally mixes conservatively with the oceanic waters leading to negative relationships between CDOM and salinity. In Mediterranean estuaries, riverine inputs are more limited or absent during the dry season producing a negative hydrological budget and, consequently, hypersalinity and an inverse circulation pattern. Much remains to be understood about CDOM and FDOM dynamics during rainy and dry periods in these last estuaries. In this study, we determined DOM absorbance and fluorescence in the Bay of Cadiz, Spain during a rainy (high riverine inputs) and dry (hypersaline conditions) period. We determined the absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(355)) and acquired excitation emission matrices (EEMs). The EEMs showed two fluorescence peaks associated with terrestrial humic-like components (peaks A and C), one peak considered to be a marine humic-like component (peak M), and two peaks considered to be amino acid-like components (peaks T and B). The a(355) values ranged from 030 to 1.99 m(-1) with the highest values during the dry season. From the rainy season to the dry season, the overall fluorescence intensity increased and fluorescent peaks M, B, and T increased by greater than two orders of magnitude, whereas the fluorescence intensities of peaks A and C changed less than one order of magnitude. Unlike temperate and tropical estuaries, the a(355) values and fluorescence of the five peaks were positive and significantly related to salinity, but with different slopes. The inverse nature of the Bay of Cadiz during the dry season could be responsible for these positive trends between CDOM/FDOM and salinity. The slopes of the humic-like peaks A and C were lower than the a(355) slope suggesting their preferential losses, likely due to photobleaching. By contrast, the slopes of the amino acid-like peaks B and T were higher than the a(355) slope suggesting an in situ production of these fluorophores, likely due to diffusion from salt marsh and coastal sediments.

AB  - Hydroxyl radicals (OH) exert a strong impact on the carbon cycle due to their nonselective and highly oxidizing nature. Reduced iron-containing clay minerals (RIC) are one of the major contributors to the formation of center dot OH in dark environments, but their interactions with humic acids (HA) are poorly known. Here, we investigate the mutual interactions between RIC and HA under dark and oxygenated conditions. HA decreased the oxidation rate of structural Fe(II) in RIC but significantly promoted the center dot OH yield. HA dissolved a fraction of Fe(II) from RIC to form an aqueous Fe(II)-HA complex. center dot OH were generated through both heterogeneous (through oxidation of structural Fe(II)) and homogeneous pathways (through oxidation of aqueous Fe(II)-HA species). RIC-mediated center dot OH production by providing H2O2 to react with Fe(II)-HA and electrons to regenerate Fe(II)-HA. This highly efficient homogeneous pathway was responsible for increased center dot OH yield. Abundant center dot OH significantly decreased the molecular size, bleached chromophores, and increased the oxygen-containing functional groups of HA. These molecular changes of HA resembled photochemical transformation of HA. The mutual interaction between RIC and HA in dark and redox- fluctuating environments provides a new pathway for fast turnover of recalcitrant organic matters in clay- and HA-rich ecosystems such as tropical forest soils and tidal marsh sediments.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Census data on benthic foraminiferal and thecamoebian tests in 52 surface sediment samples from Purakanui Inlet, Otago, New Zealand, are analyzed by cluster and correspondence analyses, Faunas are grouped into 10 sample associations with the following characterizing species: A) Trochammina inflata-at or above mean high water level in high salt meadow, salt marsh or grass; B) Jadammina macrescens/Trochammina inflata-at or above mean high-water level on the edge of high salt meadow; C) Trochamminita salsa-in sandy soil at around mean high-water spring, possibly influenced by fresh groundwater seepage; D) Pontigulasia compressa/Trochamminita salsa/Difflugia capreolata-at high tide level in the bed of the main freshwater stream flowing into the inlet; E) Haplophragmoides wilberti-in salt marsh and grass at mean high-water level on the edge of the inlet; F) Miliammina fusca-in Sarcocornia muddy, low salt meadow and sandy mud flats between mid and high tide levels; G) Elphidium excavatum-ver a wide area of tidal sand flats in the upper and middle parts of the inlet; H) Ammonia beccarii/Elphidium excavatum-in three areas of tidal sand hat in association with G, but with slightly lower salinity and nutrients; I) Elphidium excavatum/haynesina depressula-intertidally and subtidally around the inner end of the entrance channel in the vicinity of the flood tide sand delta; J) Zeaflorilus parri-intertidally and subtidally in the shallow, current swept entrance to the inlet, These correlate closely with the 8 species associations produced by cluster analysis.
   Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the following factors in decreasing order of importance are most influential in determining the faunal distribution: tidal exposure, salinity, percentage of mud, proximity of the open sea, organic carbon, phosphate and intertidal vegetation type.

AB  - Salt marsh sediments generally undergo steady accumulation over time and thus are widely used to reconstruct the depositional histories of various anthropogenic contaminants derived from atmospheric and fluvial sources. Major hurricanes can significantly affect coastal landscapes by eroding and re-distributing sediment. Thus, each major hurricane can leave distinct signals in coastal wetland sediments. On the other hand, early-diagenetic remobilization of Fe and Mn in organic rich marsh sediment is a common phenomenon. However, remobilization of Fe and Mn across the redox boundary can induce remobilization of other trace elements and thus can disturb their depositional histories. Four short (similar to 1 m) sediment cores were collected from the fringing marshes of St. Louis Bay, Mississippi (located similar to 30 km east of Hurricane Katrina's track) during 2010-2011 to investigate possible impacts of Hurricane Katrina (2005), and early-diagenetic remobilization of Fe and Mn, on trace metal and dioxin depositional histories in these sediments. Results from Pb-210, Cs-137, stable Cs, particulate organic carbon (POC), sediment bulk density and grain size indicate significant impact of hurricane event layers on anthropogenic stable Cs, while deposition profiles of V, Ni and Cr are impacted by Fe and Mn remobilization to a limited extent.

AB  - Dissolved and particulate organic carbon fluxes were measured within the Bly Creek basin, North Inlet area, Georgetown County, South Carolina. 34 tidal cycles were sampled between 20 June 1983 and 19 June 1984. Flux direction and magnitude were determined for each measured tidal cycle. Continuously measured auxiliary variables were used in a regression model to produce annual flux estimates with minimum SE. Annual budgets were similarly developed for subsystems within the basin, and annual input to the basin by rain, groundwater, and freshwater runoff were estimated.
   Mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations varied from 2.5 to 11.8 mg C.l-1, with lowest values in the summer and fall and highest values in late winter and spring. Net flux estimates varied similarly with greatest exports occurring during late winter and spring. On an annual basis 1.85 x 10(5) kg C.yr-1 (SE 3.2 x 10(4) kg C.yr-1) was exported through the tidal creek. Freshwater inputs accounted for almost-equal-to 11% of the observed export with 1.65 x 10(5) kg C originating within the marsh basin.
   Particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations varied from 0.63 to 5.3 mg C.l-1 with largest concentrations in late summer. The annual basin flux estimate of 2.04 x 10(4) kg C.yr-1 imported was not statistically different from zero. However, there was a significant import of 2.1 x 10(4) kg C.yr from the tidal creek to the marsh surface.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems, including tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, are being increasingly assessed in terms of their potential for carbon dioxide sequestration worldwide. However, there is a paucity of studies that have effectively estimated the accumulation rates of sediment organic carbon (C-org), also termed blue carbon, beyond the mere quantification of C-org stocks. Here, we discuss the use of the Pb-210 dating technique to determine the rate of C-org accumulation in these habitats. We review the most widely used Pb-210 dating models to assess their limitations in these ecosystems, often composed of heterogeneous sediments with varying inputs of organic material, that are disturbed by natural and anthropogenic processes resulting in sediment mixing and changes in sedimentation rates or erosion. Through a range of simulations, we consider the most relevant processes that impact the Pb-210 records in vegetated coastal ecosystems and evaluate how anomalies in Pb-210 specific activity profiles affect sediment and C-org accumulation rates. Our results show that the discrepancy in sediment and derived C-org accumulation rates between anomalous and ideal Pb-210 profiles is within 20% if the process causing such anomalies is well understood. While these discrepancies might be acceptable for the determination of mean sediment and C-org accumulation rates over the last century, they may not always provide a reliable geochronology or historical reconstruction. Reliable estimates of C-org accumulation rates might be difficult at sites with slow sedimentation, intense mixing and/or that are affected by multiple sedimentary processes. Additional tracers or geochemical, ecological or historical data need to be used to validate the Pb-210-derived results. The framework provided in this study can be instrumental in reducing the uncertainties associated with estimates of C-org accumulation rates in vegetated coastal sediments.

AB  - The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Sarcocornia perennis on the DOM quantity and its nature in the water column was evaluated by way of UV-visible and molecular fluorescence spectroscopy. Different light conditions occur along the night and the day periods, while, in parallel, flooding conditions vary along consecutive tidal cycles. Thus, a 24 hour field assessment was carried out in order to encompass the daily (day/night) and intertidal (high/low tide) variations. The E(2):E(3) ratio and spectral slope (S) from UV-visible spectra pointed to an export of compounds of high molecular weight (MW) to surface waters during the tidal ebbing at the colonized site. Furthermore, three main types of fluorescent compounds were found in the water synchronous fluorescence spectra: one corresponding to protein-like compounds and two to humic-like compounds. Fluorescence intensity increased during tidal ebbing, both during the day and during the night and especially for water from the colonized site. However, major increases occurred for the protein-like fluorescence band at the S. perennis colonized site during the nocturnal tide ebbing, which may be related to the activity of plants at the rhizosphere.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM), although highly variable and not very well characterized, plays a role in many important environmental reaction and transport processes, including trace metal mobilization. This study characterizes heterogeneous DOM from the pore-water of a restored urban tidal marsh, using chemical, optical, and electrochemical methods for dissolved organic carbon/nitrogen ratios (C:N: 1.8-6.4), spectroscopic characteristics (decreased aromaticity in amended sediments), element ratios (maximum sediment-associated trace metal concentrations measured <30 cm), and metal complexation properties (logK(c),: Cd: 10.7 +/- 0.7 > Pb: 9.5 +/- 0.1 > Cr: 7.3 +/- 0.1 > Cu: 5.07 +/- 0.53), all as a function of sediment depth.
   Specific DOM properties from the restored marsh were then compared to pore-water samples from a natural marsh and a simulated wetland microcosm which resulted in similar values, while the reference humic acid significantly differed in properties from field DOM. The results revealed that reference humic acids do not accurately represent the complexity of natural heterogeneous DOM, whereas a simulated wetland microcosm may provide a reasonable representation of natural DOM.
   Clear differences between amended and original soil (transition below 30 cm) were observed in DOM and trace metal properties including: lower DOM content, higher logK(c) values, less DOM complexity, development of a iron-sulfide redox buffering pool, and greater affinity for metals in the solid phase occurring in the amended sediments.

AB  - This synthesis brings together published and unpublished data in an evaluation of restoration of former salt hay farms to functioning salt marshes. We compared nine years of field measurements between three restored marshes (Dennis, Commercial, and Maurice River Townships) and a reference marsh (Moores Beach) in the mesohaline portion of Delaware Bay. In the process, we compared channel morphology, geomorphology, vegetation, sediment organic matter, fish assemblages, blue crabs, horseshoe crabs, benthic infauna, and diamondback terrapins. For fishes we compared structural (distribution, abundance) and functional (feeding, growth, survival, reproduction, production) aspects to evaluate the restored marshes in an Essential Fish Habitat context. Marsh vegetation and drainage density responded gradually and positively with restored marshes approximating the state of the reference marsh within the nine-year study period. The fauna responded more quickly and dramatically with most measures equal or greater in the restored marshes within the first one or two years after restoration. Differences in response time between the vegetation and the fauna imply that the faunal response was more dependent on access to the shallow intertidal marsh surface and intertidal and subtidal creeks than on characteristics of the vegetated marsh. The fishes in created subtidal creeks in restored marshes responded immediately and maintained fish assemblages similar to the reference marsh over the study period. The intertidal creek fish assemblages tended to become more like the reference marsh in the last years of the comparison. Overall, these results document the success of the restoration and how marshes function for both resident and transient fauna, especially fishes.

AB  - We investigated the fates of nutrients entering the Rhode River estuary from its watershed and from atmospheric deposition.  Production or consumption of materials in the upper estuary was calculated from a mixing model with chloride as a conservative tracer.  The upper estuary produced chlorophyll and dissolved PO4(3-) (DPO4(3-)) but consumed particulate PO4(3-) (PPO4(3-)), total inorganic N, dissolved organic N, and particulate organic C.  These net fluxes were influenced more by shallow, open-water areas than by the tidal marshes which cover two-thirds of the area of the upper estuary.  Ratios of chlorophyll to organic C, N, and P suggest that most of the suspended particulate organic matter in the upper estuary was produced by phytoplankton rather than derived from watershed inputs.  The consumption of nitrate due to phytoplankton production and the production of DPO4(3-) due to release from particulate P after deposition in sediments resulted in low inorganic N:P ratios, contrasting sharply with the lower estuary and adjacent Chesapeake Bay.  Dissolved inorganic N and P entered the upper estuary from the watershed at an atomic ratio of 26 but left the upper estuary at a ratio of 2.7.  The release of DPO4(3-) from watershed-derived sediments may be a common feature among estuaries and could promote N limitation of primary production in estuarine and coastal waters.

AB  - Our study of sediment accretion rates from four low tidal-range sites along the Gulf of Mexico does not support previous hypotheses concerning the relationship between tidal range and vertical accretion rates. The addition of our data to an earlier data set decreased the correlation between these variables, and all but one of our low-tidal range sites had positive accretion rates, contradicting previous studies which have predicted that low tidal-range sites would have negative net accretion rates. Additionally, in transects across the marsh, accretion rates decreased from low- to high-marsh stations; however, this appeared to be caused by changes in rates of organic matter accumulation, not mineral matter accumulation, as has been proposed in previous studies. Vertical accretion rates were more strongly correlated with organic matter accumulation rates than mineral matter accumulation rates, confirming previous studies which indicated the important role of sediment organic matter in determining sediment structure. These results do not imply that mineral matter is unimportant in maintaining the elevation of the marsh; mineral matter input affects organic matter production and sediment bulk density. There was little correlation between mineral and organic matter accumulation rates, with average organic matter accumulation rates for each site having little variation compared to the variation in mineral matter accumulation rates. This result supports a previous hypothesis that there may be a limit to annual rates of organic matter accumulation. Finally, the study indicates that the negative net accretion rates documented in Louisiana are not typical of other Gulf coast wetlands.

AB  - Anthropogenic sea level rise (SLR) presents one of the greatest risks to human lives and infrastructures. Coastal vegetated ecosystems, that is, tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests, elevate the seabed through soil accretion, providing a natural coastline protection against SLR. The soil accretion of these ecosystems has never been assessed in hot desert climate regions, where water runoff is negligible. However, tropical marine ecosystems are areas of intense calcification that may constitute an important source of sediment supporting seabed elevation, compensating for the lack of terrestrial inputs. We estimated the long-term (C-14-centennial) and short-term (Pb-210-20th century) soil accretion rates (SARs) and inorganic carbon (C-inorg) burial in coastal vegetated ecosystems of the Saudi coasts of the central Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Short-term SARs (SE) in mangroves of the Red Sea (0.270.22cm/year) were twofold the SLR for that region since 1925 (0.13cm/year). In the Arabian Gulf, only mangrove forest SAR is equivalent to local SLR estimates for the period 1979-2007 (0.210.09 compared to 0.220.05cm/year, respectively). Long-term SARs are comparable or higher than the global estimates of SLR for the late Holocene (0.01cm/year). In all habitats of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, SARs are supported by high carbonate accretion rates, comprising 40% to 60% of the soil volume. Further studies on the role of carbonates in coastal vegetated ecosystems are required to understand their role in adaptation to SLR.
   Plain Language Summary Marine wetlands: mangroves, salt-marshes, and seagrass beds protect the coast against the human-induced sea level rise worldwide. They trap sediment, and this way elevated the seabeds, at paces equivalent to sea level rise. The amount of sediment trapped is generally linked to riverine inputs and surface runoff. However, in arid tropical regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, this source of sediment to the sea is almost unexistant. We studied the rate of seabed elevation in wetlands of the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We found that Mangrove and Seagrass (Red Sea only) seabed elevation rates are equivalent to sea level rise rates of the twentieth century, due to greenhouse gas emissions. This is possible because of accumulation of carbonate sediment coming from coral reefs weathering, replacing terrestrial inputs in the tropical arid area. Our study strengthens the relevance of wetlands to human societies in the mitigation of climate change, and we emphasize the need to protect and restore them.

AB  - Fluorescence 3D excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectra of oil products in artificial seawater were monitored as a function of irradiation time in a solar simulator. EEMs were obtained for an excitation range of 240-400nm and an emission range of 248-830nm; this is the wavelength range typically used in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) EEM studies in natural waters. This allows for comparison to prior work on CDOM in an oil-contaminated salt marsh that attributed a fluorescent component in the tryptophan/tyrosine protein-region to oil. For comparison, EEMs were also measured for a broader excitation range of 220-400nm typically used in oil related studies to capture the primary oil peak at lower excitation wavelengths. Fluorescence intensities in both excitation wavelength ranges decayed exponentially with irradiation time consistent with first-order kinetics. There was little change in wavelength for primary oil peaks. However, in the CDOM, wavelength range peaks typically shifted to longer excitation and shorter emission wavelengths, moving into the protein peak region of the CDOM EEM spectrum. This is consistent with a decrease in the complexity of the structure of the organic material. Half-lives for photodegradation ranged from 0.36 to 7.2days for the oil wavelength range and 0.14 to 28days for the CDOM wavelength range. Higher density oils typically had higher degradation rate constants. Peak locations and peak behaviour are consistent with the primary fluorophore in the oil products being PAH-related.

AB  - Tidal marsh habitats provide many important functions to coastal areas and are a valuable economic resource. Polyhaline marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora can experience top-down control by the snail Littoraria irrorata who primarily impact Spartina through facilitating fungal growth on wounds they create. This grazing pressure may have selected for the production of chemical defenses in Spartina and other polyhaline marsh plants that deter snail feeding and fungal growth. Both Spartina and Littoraria can co-occur in mesohaline marshes that line the Chesapeake Bay, but little is known about interactions between this snail and plants in this habitat. Plant diversity, identity, and consumer abundance can differ between poly- and mesohaline marshes, and this may yield different patterns in the two marsh types. We investigated whether two abundant plants in a Chesapeake Bay mesohaline marsh of salinity similar to 13ppt deterred snail feeding and inhibited fungal growth. Through a bioassay-guided fractionation approach, we assessed palatability to snails and growth of the fungus Phaeosphaeria spartinae in response to chemical components in the invasive marsh grass Phragmites australis and the native sedge Bolboschoenus robustus. Both plants possessed chemicals that significantly deterred snail feeding compared to Spartina chemicals. In addition, both plants inhibited fungal growth, mediated by multiple metabolites. Snail density in this marsh was low (25 snails m(-2)), but may be enough to select for defenses in Bolboschoenus, or deterrent and inhibitory metabolites may be selected for by other consumers or factors. Chemical defenses in invasive Phragmites may contribute to its success in the Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - Microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 was carried out under two different applied potentials, -0.36 V and -0.66 V vs. SHE, using a biological sludge as the inoculum. Both potentials were thermodynamically appropriate for converting CO2 to acetate but only -0.66 V enabled hydrogen evolution. No acetate production was observed at -0.36 V, while up to 244 +/- 20 mg L-1 acetate was produced at -0.66 V vs. SHE. The same microbial inoculum implemented in gas-liquid contactors with H-2 and CO2 gas supply led to acetate production of 2500 mg L-1. When a salt marsh sediment was used as the inoculum, no reduction was observed in the electrochemical reactors, while supplying H-2 + CO2 gas led to formate and then acetate production. Finally, pure cultures of Sporomusa ovata grown under H-2 and CO2 gas feeding showed acetate production of up to 2904 mg L-1, higher than those reported so far in the literature for S. ovata implemented in bioelectrochemical processes. Unexpected ethanol production of up to 1411 mg L-1 was also observed. All these experimental data confirm that hydrogen produced on the cathode by water electrolysis is an essential mediator in the microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2. Implementing homoacetogenic microbial species in purposely designed gas-liquid biocontactors should now be considered as a relevant strategy for developing CO2 conversion.

AB  - To investigate the spatial and temporal variations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions and determine the key environmental factors influencing their fluxes across the coastal marsh dominated by Suaeda salsa in the Yellow River estuary (China), short-term measurements were conducted in intertidal zone in autumn and winter during 2011-2012. Results showed that mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes and their cumulative emissions indicated intertidal zone of the examined marshes as strong CO2 source and weak CH4 sink over all sampling seasons with values of 34.35 mgCO(2)m(-2)h(-1) and -0.0084 mgCH(4)m(-2)h(-1) and 804.21 gCO(2)m(-2) and -198.85 mgCH(4)m(-2), respectively. Temporal variations of CO2 emission were strongly correlated with air and sediment temperatures, while spatial variations were mainly affected by vegetation composition at spatial scale. The freeze/thaw cycles in sediments during early winter and midwinter were one of main factors influencing the temporal variations of CH4 emission, while the concentrations of sulfate might greatly influence the spatial variation of CH4 fluxes. Next step, to assess the CO2 and CH4 inventory precisely during autumn and winter, the potential effects of exogenous nutrient loading on their emissions from intertidal zone of the Yellow River estuary should be emphasized and the long-term studies should be conducted.

AB  - The present study describes the temporal variability of the water fCO(2) as well as the different driving forces controlling this variability, on time scales from daily to seasonal, in the Rio San Pedro, a tidal creek located in a salt marsh area in the Bay of Cadiz (SW Iberian Peninsula). This shallow tidal creek system is affected by effluents of organic matter and nutrients from the surrounding marine fish farms. Continuous pCO(2), salinity and temperature were recorded for four periods of approximately one month, between February and September in 2004. Major processes controlling the CO2 variability are related to three different time scales. Daily variations in fCO(2) are controlled by tidal advection and mixing of the water from within the creek and the seawater that enters from the Bay of Cadiz. Significant cyclical variations of the fCO(2) have been observed with the maximum values occurring at low tide. On a fortnightly time scale, the amplitude of the daily variability of fCO(2) is modulated by the variations in the residence time of the water within the creek, which are related to the spring-neap tide sequence. On a third time scale, high seasonal variability is observed for the temperature, salinity and fCO(2). Maximum and minimum values for fCO(2) were 380 mu atm and 3760 mu atm for February and July respectively. Data suggest that seasonal variability is related to the seasonal variability in discharges from the fish farm and to the increase with temperature of organic matter respiratory processes in the tidal creek. The fCO(2) values observed are in the same range as several highly polluted European estuaries or waters surrounding mangrove forests. From the air-water CO2 flux computed, it can be concluded that the Rio San Pedro acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere throughout the year, with the summer accounting for the higher average monthly flux.

AB  - We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to describe the food web of the Lapalme Lagoon, one of the best preserved coastal lagoons along the French Mediterranean coast. Three surveys, corresponding to contrasting situations both in terms of continental inputs and of connection between the lagoon and the open sea, were conducted in June and September 2004 and in February 2005. There were significant spatiotemporal changes in the isotopic ratios of both primary producers and consumers. Temporal changes were mostly linked to important C-13-depleted continental inputs caused by the long period of heavy rainfall before the June survey. Conversely, isotopic ratios were rather similar in September and February despite the opening of the connection of the lagoon with the sea between these two surveys. The interpretation of the results in terms of the structure of the trophic network differed between the June period and the two other ones. In September 2004 and February 2005, the food web was mostly based on SOM and lagoon POM pools with only a few consumers departing from this general trend. In June 2004, a significant proportion of consumers were conversely C-13-depleted probably due to the assimilation of significant amounts of continental inputs by grazers and filter-feeders. This stresses the necessity of carrying out seasonal surveys to get a sound idea of the structure of the food web in highly variable ecosystems such as coastal lagoons. Spatial changes in isotopic ratios were likely linked to: (1) the salinity/confinement gradient with a trend toward lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (i.e., higher continental influence) in the inner part of the main lagoon; and (2) the high delta N-15 values of primary producers and discretely motile consumers in a semi-confined site located downstream a vineyard receiving large amounts of fertilizers. We hypothesised that these inputs are quickly N-15-enriched through denitrification and ammonia volatilisation processes and then contribute to the N-15-enrichment of salt marsh plants and seagrass at this site. This interpretation is supported by the fact that such a 15 N-enrichment of primary producers only occurred in February (i.e., after the dispersion of the fertilizers). Conversely, discretely motile consumers were 15 N-enriched all year round, which suggests that they were mostly exploiting the detritic pool derived from 1 5 N-enriched salt marsh plants.

AB  - Glomalin, an arbuscular mycorrhizal protein component of soil, can be used as an indicator of terrigenous-derived carbon. We measured glomalin in sediments using the terrestrial end-member as a reference in four coastal settings: (1) intertidal seagrass meadows distributed over a rainfall gradient, (2) sediments inshore and offshore from the mouth of a river, (3) coastal coral reefs at various distances from the shore, and (4) intertidal wetlands with varying levels of groundwater influence. Across the rainfall gradient, glomalin in seagrass meadow sediments increased at sites with high mean annual rainfall during the wet season (r(2) = 0.27; F-1,F-29 = 5.75; p = 0.029). Glomalin decreased in inshore river sediments (terrestrial) to offshore (marine) sediments (r(2) = 0.81; F-1,F-17 = 71.7; p <= 0.0001). Furthermore, glomalin in reef sediments decreased with distance from the shore. The high intertidal was rich in glomalin where groundwater flowed directly into the wetland compared with those with little groundwater influences. Our data indicate that rivers and groundwater transport terrestrial material, and that mangroves, salt marsh, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs accumulate it, but the connections vary among sites, within sites, and seasonally. Variations in glomalin concentrations are indicative of links between the terrestrial and marine environment that reflect proximity, filtration services, and the level of subsidies that marine ecosystems derive from terrestrial sources. Assessment of glomalin contributes to evaluating terrestrial-marine connectivity, and thus provides knowledge to improve catchment management for the protection of marine ecosystems.

AB  - The soil environment teems with microbes that play fundamental roles in controlling biogeochemical cycles, thus providing support for organisms above and below ground to thrive. With the contemporary development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, a growing body of literature has shown that organismal composition and abundance within microbial communities can orderly and sequentially change through time. Interestingly, these patterns of ecological succession share commonalities across distinct systems, e.g. receding glacier forelands, salt marsh chronosequence, volcanic deposited gradients, post-mining areas and abandoned agricultural fields. Of critical importance, most of the available literature is based on community taxa distribution, with relatively little known about the successional changes in community functional traits. Here, we provide an overview of advances in molecular methods based on DNA sequencing and describe how these methods can enhance our understanding of the dynamics of microbial communities, with particular implications for studying patterns of microbial succession in soils. Collectively, the use of molecular methods can promote a comprehensive understanding of how microbial communities systematically change over both spatial and temporal scales, thus providing the basis for predicting microbial community responses after short- and long-term disturbances and in future environmental change scenarios.

AB  - An accurate description of the carbonate system in pore waters is valuable in studies involving the degradation of sedimentary organic matter, recrystallization of calcium carbonate minerals, calculations of mineral saturation state, and cycling of ions affected by pH. Here, we analyze water chemistry of pore water extracted using centrifugation and Rhizon samplers from hemipelagic sediments in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, and a shallow salt marsh from Norfolk, England. In both study areas, the data are internally consistent for each pore-water separation technique, but the measured isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13([DIC])) differs between the two techniques. We performed laboratory experiments that show that both Rhizons and centrifugation are prone to degassing of CO2 enriched with C-12. We suggest that during sampling with Rhizons, air fills the voids left by extracted pore water; combined with the membrane's design to exclude air, some of the aqueous CO2 diffuses into these air bubbles instead of the sampler. Rhizons produce reliable calcium, strontium, manganese, and barium concentration data when soaked in deionized water and then flushed with the sample immediately prior to sampling. However, pore-water extractions with Rhizons are less reliable for analyses of pH and delta C-13([DIC]) Centrifugation produces reliable carbonate chemistry and major element data when tubes are fully filled without headspace and sealed tightly. Working in CO2 low/free atmosphere (e.g., N-2 glovebox) enhances the chance of losing CO2 from the sample in both sampling techniques due to increased negative gradient of CO2 between the core and its surrounding.

AB  - Coastal marshes take up atmospheric CO2 while emitting CO2, CH4, and N2O. This ability to sequester carbon (C) is much greater for wetlands on a per area basis than from most ecosystems, facilitating scientific, political, and economic interest in their value as greenhouse gas sinks. However, the greenhouse gas balance of Gulf of Mexico wetlands is particularly understudied. We describe the net ecosystem exchange (NEEc) of CO2 and CH4 using eddy covariance (EC) in comparison with fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O using chambers from brackish and freshwater marshes in Louisiana, USA. From EC, we found that 182gCm(-2)yr(-1) was lost through NEEc from the brackish marsh. Of this, 11g Cm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CH4 emissions and the remaining 171gCm(-2)yr(-1) resulted from net CO2 emissions. In contrast, -290gCm(2)yr(-1) was taken up through NEEc by the freshwater marsh, with 47gCm(-2)yr(-1) emitted as CH4 and -337gCm(-2)yr(-1) taken up as CO2. From chambers, we discovered that neither site had large fluxes of N2O. Sustained-flux greenhouse gas accounting metrics indicated that both marshes had a positive (warming) radiative balance, with the brackish marsh having a substantially greater warming effect than the freshwater marsh. That net respiratory emissions of CO2 and CH4 as estimated through chamber techniques were 2-4 times different from emissions estimated through EC requires additional understanding of the artifacts created by different spatial and temporal sampling footprints between techniques.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth and sequester globally significant amounts of atmospheric carbon (C). Extreme rates of soil C accumulation are widely assumed to reflect efficient C storage. Yet the fraction of wetland C lost via hydrologic export has not been directly quantified, since comprehensive budgets including direct estimates of lateral C loss are lacking. We present a complete net ecosystem C budget (NECB), demonstrating that lateral losses of C are a major component of the NECB for the largest stable brackish tidal marsh on the U.S. Pacific coast. Mean annual net ecosystem exchange of CO(2)with the atmosphere (NEE = -185 g C m(2)year(-1), negative NEE denoting ecosystem uptake) was compared to long-term soil C burial (87-110 g C m(2)year(-1)), suggesting only 47-59% of fixed atmospheric C accumulates in soils. Consistently, direct monitoring in 2017-2018 showed NEE of -255 g C m(-2) year(-1), and hydrologic export of 105 g C m(-2) year(-1)(59% of NEE remaining on site). Despite their high C sequestration capacity, lateral losses from coastal wetlands are typically a larger fraction of the NECB when compared to other terrestrial ecosystems. Loss of inorganic C (the least measured NECB term) was 91% of hydrologic export and may be the most important term limiting C sequestration. The high productivity of coastal wetlands thus serves a dual function of C burial and estuarine export, and the multiple fates of fixed C must be considered when evaluating wetland capacity for C sequestration.

AB  - The objectives of this study are to investigate distribution of trace elements and heavy metals in the salt marsh and wetland soil and biogeochemical processes in the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The results show that Hg, Cd and to some extent, As and Pb have been significantly accumulated in soils. The strongest correlations were found between concentrations of Ni and total organic matter contents. The correlations decreased in the order: Ni > Cr > Sr > Co > Zn, Cd > Cu > Cs. Strong correlations were also observed between total P and concentrations of Ni, Co, Cr, Sr, Zn, Cu, and Cd. This may be related to the P spilling accident in 2005 in the Bangs Lake site. Lead isotopic ratios in soils matched well those of North American coals, indicating the contribution of Pb through atmospheric fallout from coal power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A comparative mesocosm experiment was carried out to determine the effects of natural foods of different quality and quantity on the structure of natural meiobenthic communities collected in undisturbed sediment from the polluted Westerschelde and the comparatively undisturbed Gironde estuaries. Nematode communities are more diverse and species rich in the latter estuary. The organic matter or foods used were phytoplankton, green alga, salt marsh plant detritus and leaf litter detritus which were added at three dose rates including a high dose. There was no change in community structure in response to the treatments in either of the estuarine meiobenthic communities. Analysis of all the results from this experiment indicate that the food quantity manipulations had almost no effect on the deposit feeding meiofauna. It may be that the reserves of organic matter within the sediment were sufficient to satisfy their dietary requirements for the duration of the experiment. The abundance of diatom/epigrowth feeding nematodes which were initially dominant in the Gironde, declined substantially suggesting that they may have been food limited since diatoms were not among the sources of organic matter added to the mesocosm. There was no specific response to the five different types of organic matter added to the mesocosm.

AB  - The distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the natural carbon isotope ratio of DOC (DOC)-C-13 in estuaries reflect the predominant sources and sinks of organic matter from both allochthonous and autochthonous origins. The traditional view is that DOC in land-margin ecosystems reflects mainly the mixing of land-derived and oceanic DOC. However, this view is not consistent with the bulk of our data from a survey of DOC and (DOC)-C-13 distributions in estuaries on the East and Gulf coasts of the USA. While it is accurate that the DOC in estuaries includes material derived from land and from the ocean, the distributions of DOC and (DOC)-C-13 in several estuaries reflect additional DOC inputs from estuarine phytoplankton and tidal marshes. Even when DOC concentrations were distributed conservatively, the isotopic composition of the DOC revealed the existence of a dynamic cycle of DOC input and removal in some systems.

AB  - Tidal wetlands can be important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems. As a result, wetland restoration could increase MeHg concentrations. Previous research has shown that addition of Fe[II] to wetland sediment can reduce MeHg production by decreasing concentrations of bioavailable Hg complexes with dissolved sulfur species. In this study, the potential for reducing MeHg production via an iron amendment was evaluated in laboratory microcosms that used intact sediments from a tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay. The microcosms were maintained under simulated tidal conditions and amended at four iron doses (0, 180, 360, and 720 g-Fe/m(2)). Two experiments were conducted: one with devegetated sediments and one with live wetland vegetation. Following iron addition to the devegetated sediments, porewater S[-II] concentrations decreased for each dose relative to the control with the average weekly export of MeHg in the surface water decreased by 82% and 89% for the two highest doses, respectively. Despite substantial variability within treatment groups, similar trends were observed for the vegetated microcosms. The results suggest that iron addition has the potential to provide a landscape-scale control on MeHg released by restored tidal wetlands; however, additional research is required to evaluate the efficacy of this approach under field conditions.

AB  - We report measurements of pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total or titration alkalinity (TAlk), Ca2+, Mg2+, sulfate, and sulfide data at the seawater-freshwater interface in a shallow groundwater aquifer in North Inlet, South Carolina. These measurements and a diagenetic modeling analysis indicate that the groundwaters at North Inlet are mixtures of seawater and freshwater end-members and are seriously modified by carbon dioxide inputs from organic carbon degradation via SO4 (2-) reduction across the entire salinity range and fermentation and CaCO3, dissolution in the low-salinity region. DIC and TAlk are several times higher than the theoretical dilution line, whereas Ca2+ is slightly higher and SO42- is somewhat lower than the dilution line. Partial pressure of CO2 in the groundwater is extremely high (0.05 to 0.12 atm). These deviations are consistent with theoretical predictions from known diagenetic reactions. Estimated groundwater DIC fluxes to the South Atlantic Bight from either the surficial aquifer (via salt marshes) or the Upper Floridan Aquifer (direct input) are significant when compared to riverine flux in this area.

AB  - Coastal marshes depend on belowground biomass of roots and rhizomes to contribute to peat and soil organic carbon, accrete soil and alleviate flooding as sea level rises. For nutrient-limited plants, eutrophication has either reduced or stimulated belowground biomass depending on plant biomass allocation response to fertilization. Within a freshwater wetland impoundment receiving minimal sediments, we used experimental plots to explore growth models for a common freshwater macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus. We used N-addition and control plots (4 each) to test whether remotely sensed vegetation indices could predict leaf N concentration, root: shoot ratios and belowground biomass of S. acutus. Following 5 months of summer growth, we harvested whole plants, measured leaf N and total plant biomass of all above and belowground vegetation. Prior to harvest, we simulated measurement of plant spectral reflectance over 164 hyperspectral Hyperion satellite bands (350-2500 nm) with a portable spectroradiometer. N-addition did not alter whole plant, but reduced belowground biomass 36% and increased aboveground biomass 71%. We correlated leaf N concentration with known N-related spectral regions using all possible normalized difference (ND), simple band ratio (SR) and first order derivative ND (FDN) and SR (FDS) vegetation indices. FDN1235, (549) was most strongly correlated with leaf N concentration and also was related to belowground biomass, the first demonstration of spectral indices and belowground biomass relationships. While S. acutus exhibited balanced growth (reduced root: shoot ratio with respect to nutrient addition), our methods also might relate N-enrichment to biomass point estimates for plants with isometric root growth. For isometric growth, foliar N indices will scale equivalently with above and belowground biomass. Leaf N vegetation indices should aid in scaling-up field estimates of biomass and assist regional monitoring.

AB  - We measured the abundance of Cladium jamaieense (Crantz) seeds and three biomarkers in freshwater marsh soils in Shark River Slough (SRS), Everglades National Park (ENP) to determine the degree to which these paleoecological proxies reflect spatial and temporal variation in vegetation. We found that C. janiaieense seeds and the biomarkers Paq, total lignin phenols (TLP) and kaurenes analyzed from surface soils were all significantly correlated with extant aboveground C. jamaicense biomass quantified along a vegetation gradient from a C. jamaicense to a wet prairie/slough (WPS) community. Our results also suggest that these individual proxies may reflect vegetation over different spatial scales: Paq and kaurenes correlated most strongly (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.99, respectively) with vegetation within 1 m of a soil sample, while seeds and TLP reflected vegetation 0-20 in upstream of soil samples. These differences in the spatial scale depicted by the different proxies may be complementary in understanding aspects of historic landscape patterning. Soil profiles of short (25 cm) cores showed that downcore variation in C. jamaicense seeds was highly correlated with two of the three biomarkers (Paq, R-2 = 0.84, p < 0.005; TLP, R-2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001), and all four of the proxies indicated a recent increase in C. jamaicense biomass at the site. Using a preliminary depth-to-age relationship based on matching charcoal peaks with available ENP fire records (1980-present) specific to our coring site, we found that peak-depths in C. jamaicense seed concentration appeared to correspond to recent minimum water levels (e.g., 1989 and 2001), and low seed abundance corresponded to high water levels (e.g., 1995), consistent with the known autecology of C. jamaicense. In summary, the combination of C. jamaicense seeds and biomarkers may be useful for paleoecological reconstruction of vegetation change and ultimately in guaging the success of ongoing efforts to restore historic hydrologic conditions in the South Florida Everglades.

AB  - Coastal restoration strategies in the Mississippi River Delta Plain include use of direct sediment additions as well as river diversions to reintroduce fresh water and sediments into coastal marshes. Often, these diversions are located in the upper parts of the coastal basins, where fresh water floating marshes predominate. Floating marshes are wetlands of emergent vascular vegetation that have a significant mat of live and dead roots, dead organic material, and mineral sediments. Mats move vertically as ambient water levels rise and fall. As such, extensive water exchange is maintained below the mat, while overland sheet flow is reduced or eliminated, limiting inorganic sediment input. Thus, the effect of sediment introduction into floating marsh wetlands is unknown. In this study, we documented marsh mat response to Mississippi River sediment addition and measured change in soil properties, species composition change, and growth of vegetation. The study included two sites located in seasonally floating thin-mat marshes dominated by spikerush (Eleocharis baldwinii). At each site, 16 plots were established. Each 1 m(2) plot was randomly assigned one of four treatments: none, low, medium, and high sediment additions, with the highest sediment addition representing approximately 15 years of deposition from an existing river diversion at Caernarvon, Louisiana. With increasing sediment addition, significant increases in bulk density, and significant decreases in percent organic matter in the top 25 cm of the marsh mat were observed. Most of the sediment added remained in the top 10 cm of the marsh mat. No significant differences in water level over the mat were found among treatments, indicating that buoyancy was not affected by sediment addition. Aboveground biomass tended to increase with sediment addition, although the differences were not statistically significant. Belowground biomass was not significantly affected by the addition of sediment. These results indicate that sediment additions at the level supplied by existing diversion structures should not sink floating marsh mats and may have slight positive effects on vegetation biomass.

AB  - Bulk organic stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) and element geochemistry (total organic carbon (TOC) and organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N)) analysis is a developing technique in Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) research. The uptake of this technique in Northern Europe is limited compared to North America, where the common existence of coastal marshes with isotopically distinctive C-3 and C-4 vegetation associated with well-defined inundation tolerance permits the reconstruction of RSL in the sediment record. In Northern Europe, the reduced range in delta C-13 values between organic matter sources in C-3 estuaries can make the identification of elevation-dependent environments in the Holocene sediment record challenging and this is compounded by the potential for post-depositional alteration in bulk delta C-13 values. The use of contemporary regional delta C-13, C/N and TOC datasets representing the range of physiographic conditions commonly encountered in coastal wetland sediment sequences opens up the potential of using absolute values of sediment geochemistry to infer depositional environments and associated reference water levels. In this paper, the application of contemporary bulk organic delta C-13, C/N and TOC to reconstruct Holocene RSL is further explored. An extended contemporary regional geochemical dataset of published delta C-13, C/N and TOC observations (n = 142) from tidal-dominated C-3 wetland deposits (representing tidal flat, saltmarsh, reedswamp and fen carr environments) in temperate NW Europe is compiled, and procedures implemented to correct for the C-13 Suess effect on contemporary delta C-13 are detailed. Partitioning around medoids analysis identifies two distinctive geochemical groups in the NW European dataset, with tidal flat/saltmarsh and reedswamp/fen carr environments exhibiting characteristically different sediment delta C-13, C/N and TOC values. A logistic regression model is developed from the NW European dataset in order to objectively identify in the sediment record geochemical groups and, more importantly, group transitions, thus allowing the altitude of reference water levels to be determined. The application of this method in RSL research is demonstrated using the Holocene sediments of the Mersey Estuary (UK), in which delta C-13, C/N and TOC variability is typical of that encountered in Holocene sediments from C-3 coastal wetlands in NW Europe. Group membership was predicted with high probability in the depositional contexts studied and the accuracy of group prediction is verified by microfossil evidence. The method presented facilitates the application of delta C-13, C/N and TOC analysis in RSL reconstruction studies in C-3 vegetated wetlands throughout temperate NW Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In situ poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) levels and repeating-unit compositions were examined in stratified photosynthetic microbial mats from Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Mass., and Ebro Delta, Spain. Unlike what has been observed in pure cultures of phototrophic bacteria, the prevalence of hydroxyvalerate (HV) repeating units relative to hydroxybutyrate (HB) repeating units was striking. In the cyanobacteria-dominated green material of Sippewissett mats, the mole percent ratio of repeating units was generally 1HB:1HV. In the purple sulfur bacteria-dominated pink material the relationship was typically 1HB:2HV. In Sippewissett mats, PHA contributed about 0.5 to 1% of the organic carbon in the green layer and up to 6% in the pink layer. In Ebro Delta mats, PHA of approximately 1HB:2HV-repeating-unit distribution contributed about 2% of the organic carbon of the composite photosynthetic layers (the green and pink layers were not separated). Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh mats were utilized for more extensive investigation of seasonal, diel, and exogenous carbon effects. When the total PHA content was normalized to organic carbon, there was little seasonal variation in PHA levels. However, routine daily variation was evident at all sites and seasons. In every case, PHA levels increased during the night and decreased during the day. This phenomenon was conspicuous in the pink layer, where PHA levels doubled overnight. The daytime declines could be inhibited by artificial shading. Addition of exogenous acetate, lactate, and propionate induced two- to fivefold increases in the total PHA levels when applied in the daylight but had no effect when applied at night. The distinct diel pattern of in situ PHA accumulation at night appears to be related, in some phototrophs, to routine dark energy metabolism and is not influenced by the availability of organic nutrients.

AB  - We report measurements of seasonal variability in the C-N stable isotope ratios of plants collected across the habitat mosaic of San Francisco Bay, its marshes, and its tributary river system. Analyses of 868 plant samples were binned into 10 groups (e.g., terrestrial riparian, freshwater phytoplankton, salt marsh) to determine whether C-N isotopes can be used as biomarkers for tracing the origins of organic matter in this river-marsh-estuary complex. Variability of delta(130)C and delta(15)N was high (similar to5-10parts per thousand) within each plant group, and we identified three modes of variability: (1) between species and their microhabitats, (2) over annual cycles of plant growth and senescence, and (3) between living and decomposing biomass. These modes of within-group variability obscure any source-specific isotopic signatures, confounding the application of C-N isotopes for identifying the origins of organic matter. A second confounding factor was large dissimilarity between the delta(13)C-delta(15)N of primary producers and the organic-matter pools in the seston and sediments. Both confounding factors impede the application of C-N isotopes to reveal the food supply to primary consumers in ecosystems supporting diverse autotrophs and where the isotopic composition of organic matter has been transformed and become distinct from that of its parent plant sources. Our results support the advice of others: variability of C-N stable isotopes within all organic-matter pools is high and must be considered in applications of these isotopes to trace trophic linkages from primary producers to primary consumers. Isotope-based approaches are perhaps most powerful when used to complement other tools, such as molecular biomarkers, bioassays, direct measures of production, and compilations of organic-matter budgets.

AB  - Industrial wet phosphoric acid production in Huelva (SW Spain) has led to the controversial stockpiling of waste phosphogypsum by-products, resulting in the release of significant quantities of toxic impurities in salt marshes in the Tinto river estuary. In the framework of the fight against global climate change and the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a simple and efficient procedure for CO2 mineral sequestration is presented in this work, using phosphogypsum waste as a calcium source. Our results demonstrate the high efficiency of portlandite precipitation by phosphogypsum dissolution using an alkaline soda solution. Carbonation experiments performed at ambient pressure and temperature resulted in total conversion of the portlandite into carbonate. The fate of trace elements present in the phosphogypsum waste was also investigated, and trace impurities were found to be completely transferred to the final calcite. We believe that the procedure proposed here should be considered not only as a solution for reducing old stockpiles of phosphogypsum wastes, but also for future phosphoric acid and other gypsum-producing industrial processes, resulting in more sustainable production.

AB  - Mangroves are one of the few woody ecosystems that grow in hot-arid climates. They can survive extreme conditions of low precipitation, high solar radiation, wide temperature fluctuations and hypersalinity. These unique mangroves have distinct geomorphology, hydrology, forest structure, tree physiology, and soil biogeochemistry. In this review, supported by field data from Australia and Mexico, we explore the characteristics of mangroves in arid climates of the world. These mangroves are mostly tide-dominated with freshwater flows restricted to groundwater and sporadic tropical storms. They form dense forests with stunted growth dominated mainly by trees of the genus Avicennia that co-occur with salt marshes in the high intertidal. Their soils have low nutrient and carbon concentrations, and high soil delta 15 N and delta 13C values compared to subhumid and humid mangroves. Mangroves in arid climates have relatively low human pressure due to sparse human settlements. Key threats to these mangroves, which often persist at the edge of their physiological tolerances, include extreme drought, reductions in groundwater inputs, altered hydrology, sea-level fluctuations and increases in nutrient loading. Restoration of mangroves in arid climates should focus on restoring their hydrology. Mangroves in arid zones are under-represented in global maps and assessment programs, as they may not be consistent with countries' definition of "forests". Improved global representation and understanding of the ecology of mangroves in arid climates could help sustain their valuable ecosystem services.

AB  - Organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous sources provides energy and nutrients to nearshore food webs including filter-feeding bivalves. In Puget Sound, Washington, USA, the degree to which shellfish rely on these different organic matter subsidies may be important for their management and that of nearshore food webs in general. We explored patterns of terrestrial-marine connectivity in a large, temperate estuary using a combination of oceanographic modeling and isotopic mixing models. We first examined spatial connectivity by modeling freshwater contributions of the major river basins to Puget Sound (potential connectivity), then estimated the relative contribution of terrestrial, nearshore, and marine organic matter sources to nearshore particulate organic matter (POM) (actual connectivity) and to the diets of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (realized connectivity). To estimate actual and realized connectivity, we analyzed the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of oyster tissue, POM, and primary producers from intertidal, offshore, salt marsh, and upland habitats across the dry (summer) and wet (fall-winter) seasons. Mixing models indicated that both oyster bed POM and oyster diets were composed largely of intertidal macrophytes and salt marsh plants, with less important contributions of phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, and upland vegetation. Our findings suggest that oyster production may be driven more by coastal and marine primary production than by riverine sources, even in a fjord subject to strong freshwater influences.

AB  - It is widely recognised that wetlands play an important role in the hydrological cycle, influencing groundwater recharge, low flows, evaporation and floods. This has led to policies being formulated world-wide to conserve and manage wetlands to deliver these key services, especially flood risk reduction. Generic statements have often been published about wetland hydrological services but the term "wetlands" covers many land types, including wet woodlands, reedbeds, peat bogs, fens, and salt marshes. Each of these wetland types can have a hydrological function that is subtly different, making it difficult to generalise the flood reduction services of wetlands. In this paper we focus on two example wetland types (upland rain-fed wetlands and floodplain wetlands) to demonstrate why there are differences in flood functions both within and between wetland types. Upland wetlands generally tend to be flood generating areas while floodplain wetlands have a greater potential to reduce floods. However, landscape location and configuration, soil characteristics, topography, soil moisture status and management all influence whether these wetlands provide flood reduction services.

AB  - Terrestrial inputs of nitrogen in estuaries are increasing and altering salt marsh primary production, plant communities and associated biota. We used N isotope ratios and %N in Spartina maritima, Halimione portulacoides, Zostera noltii and below-canopy sediments to study eutrophication caused by anthropogenic land-derived nitrogen in the Mondego and Mira estuaries, Portugal. In spite of different land use practice intensities between estuaries, there were no marked differences in nitrate concentrations in the water column, but ammonium, total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations were greater in the Mondego estuary. Sediment and shoot N contents suggest a general pattern of high nitrogen regimes in Mondego and Mira, and point to a somewhat higher delivery of nitrogen into the Mondego. However, these parameters were not sensitive indicators of level of eutrophication. In contrast, delta(15) N ratios in plant shoots differed significantly and were higher in Mondego for all 3 plant species. Plant delta(15) N signatures were therefore more sensitive sentinels of land-derived nitrogen load. The parallel increase of delta(15) N in shoots and sediments indicated that both shoots and sediments followed and reflected the level of eutrophication and some larger whole estuary difference in N loads. Thus, nitrogen isotopic signatures in macrophytes and sediments were useful indicators of land-derived nitrogen in estuaries.

AB  - Several lines of evidence (direct microscopy, index biochemicals) point to predominance of eukaryotic decomposers in natural decay of dead shoots of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Recent research shows that this is also true for black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus). Ascomycetous fungi are the major initial secondary producers based on the dead shoots. There is no overlap between the species of the cordgrass (e.g., Phaeosphaeria spartinicola) and needlerush (e.g., Loratospora aestuarii) fungal-decay communities. Even when conditions in the marsh are manipulated in directions that would be expected to favor prokaryotes (extra water and nitrogen), the ascomycetes accumulate maximum organic masses in standing-decaying shoots hundreds of times larger than prokaryotic masses. Rates of fungal production are not increased by raising duration of high water availability, probably due to fine-tuned fungal adaptation to periodic dryness, but nitrogen does limit fungal productivity in decaying cordgrass. Content of living-fungal mass can be 10 to 20% of total system (= microbes + remaining plant) mass, depending on nitrogen availability, rates of invertebrate mycophagy, and probably several further factors yet to be determined. Standing crops of living fungi in cordgrass marshes in Georgia (per-m(2) basis) have been calculated to be equal to 3% (summer) to 28% (winter) of living-cordgrass standing crop. This is calculated to be about 50 to 100% of total (non-cyano) bacterial crop; the great bulk of bacterial crop is sedimentary. Fungal productivity per m(2) standing-decaying-cordgrass marsh has been provisionally found to be 10 times greater in winter than in summer (3652 mg per m(2) per day; mu = 0.07 day(-1)). Total bacterial productivity per m2 was calculated to be about x2 fungal in summer, and x0.07 fungal in winter. High yields of fungi (on the order of 50%) from cordgrass shoots may be part of the explanation for high rates of animal secondary production in saltmarsh ecosystems. Cordgrass-fungal standing crops and productivities (per unit leaf mass) do not show pronounced variation (in autumn) along a south-north latitudinal gradient from 30 degrees to 44 degreesN. One major known fate of saltmarsh-fungal secondary production is output to shredder gastropods (periwinkles, Littoraria irrorata). Other potential substantial fluxes are to amphipods (especially Uhlorchestia spartinophila) and other gastropods (especially Melampus bidentatus), and fluxes as sexual propagules (ascospores) and as remnant hyphal wall/sheath mass in fallen, decayed fragments, Key opportunities for saltmarsh-ecological research lie: in learning the details of the life histories of the more important saltmarsh-fungal producers; in determining the biotic and abiotic controls on saltmarshfungal productivity; and in investigations of impacts of fungal activities, such as the probable role that saltmarsh ascomycetes have in release of dimethylsulfide to the atmosphere.

AB  - Sediment accumulation rates were determined at several sites throughout Nauset Marsh (Massachusetts, U.S.A.), a back-barrier lagoonal system, using feldspar marker horizons to evaluate short-term rates (1 to 2 year scales) and radiometric techniques to estimate rates over longer time scales (Cs-137, Pb-210, C-14). The barrier spit fronting the Spartina-dominated study site has a complex geomorphic history of inlet migration acid overwash events. This study evaluates sediment accumulation rates in relation to inlet migration, storm events and sea-level rise. The marker horizon technique displayed strong temporal and spatial variability in response to storm events and proximity to the inlet. Sediment accumulation rates of up to 24 mm year(-1) were recorded in the immediate vicinity of the inlet during a period that included several major coastal storms, while feldspar sites remote from the inlet had substantially lower rates (trace accumulation to 2.2 mm year(-1)). During storm-free periods, accumulation rates did not exceed 6.7 mm year(-1), but remained quite variable among sites. Based on Cs-137 (3.8 to 4.5 mm year(-1)) and Pb-210 (2.6 to 4.2 mm year(-1)) radiometric techniques, integrating sediment accumulation over decadal time scales, the marsh appeared to be keeping pace with the relative rate of sea-level rise from 1921 to 1993 of 2.4 mm year(-1) At one site, the Pb-210-based sedimentation rate and rate of relative sea-level rise were nearly similar and pear rhizome analysis revealed that Distichlis spicata recently replaced this once S. patens site, suggesting that this portion of Nauset Marsh may be getting wetter, thus representing an initial response to wetland submergence. Horizon markers are useful in evaluating the role of short-term events, such as storms or inlet migration, influencing marsh sedimentation processes. However, sampling methods that integrate marsh sedimentation over decadal time scales are preferable when evaluating a systems response to sea-level rise. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - Soil properties, accretion, and accumulation were measured in tidal freshwater forests (tidal forests) of the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla rivers of the South Atlantic (Georgia USA) coast to characterize carbon (C) sequestration and nutrient (nitrogen-N, phosphorus-P) accumulation in these understudied, uncommon, and ecologically sensitive wetlands. Carbon sequestration and N and P accumulation also were measured in a tidal forest (South Newport River) that experiences saltwater intrusion to evaluate the effects of sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion on C, N and P accumulation. Finally, soil accretion and accumulation of tidal forests were compared with tidal fresh, brackish and salt marsh vegetation downstream to gauge how tidal forests may respond to SLR. Soil accretion determined using C-137 and Pb-210 averaged 1.3 and 2.2 mm yr(-1), respectively, and was substantially lower than the recent rate of SLR along the Georgia coast (3.0 mm yr(-1)). Healthy tidal forest soils sequestered C (4982 g m(-2) yr(-1)), accumulated N (3.25.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and P (0.290.56 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and trapped mineral sediment (340650 g m(-2) yr(-1)). There was no difference in long-term accretion, C sequestration, and nutrient accumulation between healthy tidal forests and tidal forests of the South Newport River that experience saltwater intrusion. Accelerated SLR is likely to lead to decline of tidal forests and expansion of oligohaline and brackish marshes where soil accretion exceeds the current rate of SLR. Conversion of tidal forest to marshes will lead to an increase in the delivery of some ecosystem services such as C sequestration and sediment trapping, but at the expense of other services (e.g. denitrification, migratory songbird habitat). As sea level rises in response to global warming, tidal forests and their delivery of ecosystem services face a tenuous future unless they can migrate upriver, and that is unlikely in most areas because of topographic constraints and increasing urbanization of the coastal zone.

AB  - Bromine (Br) cycling in natural wetlands is highly complex, including abiotic/biotic processes and multiphase inorganic/organic Br-species. Wetland ecosystems receive Br primarily from the ocean, functioning as either sinks or sources of Br, with the overall imbalance largely decided by the prevailing climate. Aiming to trace the present-day transport of oceanogenic Br (i.e., derived from salt-water spray-droplets) and its uptake and storage in brackish and freshwater wetlands, we surveyed waters, autochthonous plants, and soils/sediments from coastal marshes and mountain peatlands in the western most fringe of northern Portugal. The calculated enrichment factors of bromide (Br-) relative to chloride in rainfall (EFsea = 16.8-75.3), rivers (EFsea = 1.3-13.9) and wetland waters, superficial (EFsea = 5.8-13.1) and interstitial (EFsea = 2.1-8.9), increased towards the inland highlands. We hypothesized that these values derived mostly from a known Br autocatalytic (heterogeneous) chemical cycle, starting at the seawater-aqueous interface and progressing in altitude. Br-bearing air masses are carried far from the Atlantic Ocean by moist westerlies, with Br- rainout from the atmosphere supplying the neighbouring mountain peatlands. Average [Br] in sampled wetland soils/sediments (111-253 mg/kg) agreed with values from other coastal regions, and they were directly correlated with the abundance of organic matter, varying irrespective the [Br-] of interstitial waters (129 mu g/L-79 mg/L). According to the computed bioconcentration factors, the aqueous component was the major source of Br for all plant species investigated (BFplant/water = 2.1-508.0), as described elsewhere. However, Br contents in plants (14-173 mg/kg) evidenced interspecific differences, also suggesting a divergence from the acknowledged halophytic-glycophytic "model". As plants are recognized producers of Br volatile molecules (e.g., methyl bromide, CH3Br), we interpreted translocation factors less than one in vascular species as explanatory of phytovolatilization rather than restriction of Br- upward movement in plants. Further investigation is needed, since considerable intrinsic plant variations in CH3Br emissions are mentioned in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intertidal foreshore sediments from a 110 km stretch of the Thames Estuary were analysed for glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to track soil organic matter (OM) input and evaluate the impact of coastal urbanisation on their distribution. Concentration of branched (br) GDGTs ranged from < 1 to 15 mu g/g organic carbon (OC) and crenarchaeol ranged from 0.6 to 19 mu g/g OC. An overall decrease in brGDGTs was observed from the inner Thames (Brentford) to the outer Thames (Isle of Grain), suggesting a drop in soil OM input towards the sea. In contrast, crenarchaeol concentration was highest around east London rather than towards the open sea. Such elevated crenarchaeol concentration occurred in the section of the river most influenced by anthropogenic pollution, such as discharge points for London's major sewage treatment plants, docks and power plants. The non-systematic spatial distribution of crenarchaeol was also reflected in the branched isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index. The highest BIT values occurred upstream and in close proximity to salt marshes (0.8-1), whereas the lowest values (0.3-0.5) were towards the sea. However, unusually low values (0.4) were observed in the river section that had high crenarchaeol concentration. In contrast, bulk delta C-13 values were insensitive to London's anthropogenic influence. This suggests that the natural systematic decrease in BIT index in the estuary is overprinted by London's anthropogenic activity between Deptford Creek and Tilbury. We therefore advise caution when interpreting the BIT index for sediments in close proximity to megacities discharging industrial and municipal waste that can become incorporated into the near surface sedimentary record.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed carbon and nitrogen parameters (e.g., total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), stable isotopes of organic matter (delta C-13, delta N-15), and carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N)), grain-size parameters and deposition rate, as well as their variations in the surface layer and on the profile of the sediment cores in various ecological zones of Luoyuan Bay. The results showed that the sedimentary type of Luoyuan Bay was clay silt. The TOC, TN, delta C-13, and delta N-15 were in the range of 0.450-0.955%, 0.054-0.101%, -23.75 to - 19.47%o, and 3.57-6.72%, respectively; the C/N was in the range of 8.80-13.78. The grain-size parameters of the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were similar, whereas a similarity in the carbon and nitrogen parameters between the transition zone and mudflat was observed. The correlation of TOC and TN was different between the fresh organic matter and the obsolete organic matter. The particle size was not the main factor that controlled the TOC and TN contents in the sediments; the delta C-13 indicated the organic matter was dominated by marine sources. The average deposition rates in the Spartina alterniflora marsh, transition zone, and mudflat were 2.47, 2.79, 1.16 g cm(-2) y(-1), respectively. In the Spartina alterniflora marsh, the TOC and TN content increased by 96% and 104%, respectively, from 1955 to the present. Compared with the mudflat, the TOC and TN content in the layer between the surface and the 40-cm depth of the Spartina alterniflora marsh were 26% and 13% higher, respectively. The introduction of Spartina alterniflora and the metabolism of their roots had a significant effect on the carbon and nitrogen deposition in the layer at 0-40 cm depth. The carbon sequestration rate of the salt marsh wetland in Luoyuan Bay was comparable to the carbon sequestration of global marshes. The deposition rates of TOC and TN in the Spartina alterniflora marsh and transition zone were greater than twice that in the mudflat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Terrestrially-derived organic matter in sediments of the Delaware Estuary originates from riverine transport of soils and fresh litter, sewage and industrial wastes, and marsh export of organic matter.  The quantity, composition, and spatial distribution of terrigenous organic matter in sediments was determined by elemental (C and N), lignin, and stable carbon isotope analyses.  Sediments in the upper Delaware Estuary had low organic carbon content and high lignin content.  In contrast, sediments in the lower Delaware Estuary had high organic carbon content and low lignin content.  There was a slight decrease in the proportion of syringyl and cinnamyl phenols relative to vanillyl phenols between the upper estuary and lower estuary.  Differences in lignin and stable carbon isotope compositions between sediments of the Delaware Estuary and sediments of the Broadkill River estuary (an adjoining salt-marsh estuary) supported previous observations that marshes do not export substantial quantities of organic matter to estuaries.  Additional results suggested that lignin-rich sediments were concentrated in the upper estuary, most likely in the zone of high turbidity.  Furthermore, algal material diluted lignin-rich sediments, particularly in the lower estuary.  The weaker algal signal in bottom sediments compared to that in suspended particulate matter suggested algal material was decomposed either in the water column or at the sediment-water interface.  Physical sorting of sediments prior to deposition was also indicated by observations of compositional differences between the upper and lower estuary bottom sediments.  Finally, seasonal variations in primary productivity strongly influenced the relative abundance of terrestrial organic matter.  In fall, however, the proportion of lignin was greatest because of a combination of greater inputs of terrestrially-derived organic matter, lower river discharge, and a decrease in algal biomass.

AB  - Physiological components of food absorption (rates of particle clearance and ingestion and absorption efficiencies) were recorded in the cockles Cerastoderma edule fed variable concentration diets of phytoplankton (Isochrysis galbana) and detritus from salt-marsh vascular plants (Spartina maritina), after 2 and 12 d of acclimation to these diets. Corresponding digestive processes were also analysed, including determinations of gut passage time of food, gut fullness (GF) and digestive investments, the latter measured in terms of both metabolic faecal losses (MFL) and enzyme activities of the digestive glands. Digestive responses to increasing availability of phytoplankton included faster processing of food particles coupled to improved hydrolytic capacity of digestive glands that resulted in increased gut performance. Compared to phytoplankton, detritus utilization was constrained in the short-term by its refractory behaviour to digestion and the magnitude of metabolic faecal losses experienced by cockles fed these food materials. However, increased GF achieved during acclimation to detrital diets compensated for reduced digestibility, allowing for more food to be processed and thus cancelling out the effects of reduced passage time (and the consequent decline in absorption efficiency), Induction of the appropriate set of carbohydrases during the acclimation process resulted in increased amounts of reducing sugars released from natural substrates, with the additional benefit of diminishing the losses of endogenous materials accompanying each cycle of intracellular digestion.

AB  - Two sediment cores of up to 550 cm length from an intertidal flat of the German Wadden Sea near the island of Spiekeroog were investigated for the quantity and composition of fossil organic matter (OM). The lowermost parts of the cores are dominated by grey mud of a salt marsh facies containing mainly terrestrial OM estimated to account for 60-75% of the total OM, based on delta C-13 values and the ratio of short to long chain n-alkanols. The terrigenous origin of the dominant fraction is indicated, among others, by high proportions Of C-29 sterols and long chain n-alkanes typical of plant waxes. Coarse shell beds overlying the grey mud at 2-2.5 m depth represent a flooding and erosion event possibly related to heavy storm floods in the Middle Ages. Within the intertidal sand-dominated sediments in the upper parts of the cores total organic carbon (TOC) contents are generally low, ranging from 0.1 % to 0.5%, and correlate well with the amount of mud fraction (r(2) 0.90). At the surface, marine OM has not undergone intense diagenetic alteration and so is the dominant fraction. Eroded peat particles are common throughout most of the sequence and values of the Phragmites peat indicator (PPI) > 5 indicate an origin from reed peat due to a high relative abundance of the n-C-24 alkane. Changes in the composition of microbial communities over the depth interval investigated are documented by varying compositions of unsaturated fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbons. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was detected along the entire cores and indicates the presence of EPA-producing bacterial strains. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study determined the plant biomass (aboveground and belowground) of Salicornia brachiata from six different salt marshes distributed in Indian coastal area over one growing season (September 2014-May 2015). The nutrients concentration and their pools were estimated in plant as well as soil. Belowground biomass in S. brachiata was usually lower than the aboveground biomass. Averaged over different locations, highest biomass was observed in the month of March (2.1tha(-1)) followed by May (1.64tha(-1)), February (1.60tha(-1)), November (0.82tha(-1)) and September (0.05tha(-1)). The averaged aboveground to belowground ratio was 12.0. Aboveground and belowground biomass were negatively correlated with pH of soil, while positively with soil electrical conductivity. Further, there were positive relationships between organic carbon and belowground biomass; and available sodium and aboveground biomass. The nutrient pools in aboveground were always higher than to belowground biomass. Aboveground pools of carbon (543kgha(-1)), nitrogen (48kgha(-1)), phosphorus (4kgha(-1)), sodium (334kgha(-1)) and potassium (37kgha(-1)) were maximum in the month of March 2015. Bioaccumulation and translocation factors for sodium of S. brachiata were more than one showing tolerance to salinity and capability of phytoremediation for the saline soil.

AB  - To evaluate the influence of human activities on ecosystem respiration (CO2) and CH4 fluxes and determine the seasonal and spatial variations, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes at four sampling sites (west side of the seawall, WSS; oilfield, OF; Spartina alterniflora coastal marsh, SCM; aquaculture pond, ACP) in the Yellow River estuary from June to December in 2013. Both CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed seasonal and spatial variations in the Yellow River estuary. The average CO2 fluxes from WSS, OF, SCM and ACP were 125.36, 111.03, 241.97 and -39.49 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), while CH4 fluxes were -0.0110, -0.0165, 0.2012 and 0.0034 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Spatial variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by vegetation and soil moisture. There were significant relationships between both CO2 fluxes in WSS and SCM and CH4 flux in SCM with temperature. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors in OF and ACP. Human activities have great effect on greenhouse gas emission, especially in the area where exotic-species S. alterniflora invaded. The construction of seawall blocked sea water transporting into the study area leading to low soil moisture which accelerated CO2 emission. Aquaculture ponds act as an emission of CH4 and consumption of CO2.

AB  - Macroalgae drive the largest CO2 flux fixed globally by marine macrophytes. Most of the resulting biomass is exported through the coastal ocean as detritus and yet almost no field measurements have verified its potential net sequestration in marine sediments. This gap limits the scope for the inclusion of macroalgae within blue carbon schemes that support ocean carbon sequestration globally, and the understanding of the role their carbon plays within distal food webs. Here, we pursued three lines of evidence (eDNA sequencing, Bayesian Stable Isotope Mixing Modeling, and benthic-pelagic process measurements) to generate needed, novel data addressing this gap. To this end, a 13-month study was undertaken at a deep coastal sedimentary site in the English Channel, and the surrounding shoreline of Plymouth, UK. The eDNA sequencing indicated that detritus from most macroalgae in surrounding shores occurs within deep, coastal sediments, with detritus supply reflecting the seasonal ecology of individual species. Bayesian stable isotope mixing modeling [C and N] highlighted its vital role in supporting the deep coastal benthic food web (22-36% of diets), especially when other resources are seasonally low. The magnitude of detritus uptake within the food web and sediments varies seasonally, with an average net sedimentary organic macroalgal carbon sequestration of 8.75 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). The average net sequestration of particulate organic carbon in sediments is 58.74 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), the two rates corresponding to 4-5% and 26-37% of those associated with mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds, systems more readily identified as blue carbon habitats. These novel data provide important first estimates that help to contextualize the importance of macroalgal-sedimentary connectivity for deep coastal food webs, and measured fluxes help constrain its role within global blue carbon that can support policy development. At a time when climate change mitigation is at the foreground of environmental policy development, embracing the full potential of the ocean in supporting climate regulation via CO2 sequestration is a necessity.

AB  - Mangroves are critical in global carbon budget while vulnerable to exotic plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora, one of typical salt marsh plant grows forcefully along the coast of China, has invaded the native mangrove habitats in Zhangjiang Estuary. However, the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on soil carbon gases (CH4 and CO2) emission from mangroves are not fully understood. Accordingly, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the soil CH4 and CO2 emission during growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 at four adjacent wetlands, namely bare mudflat (Mud), Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM) and S. alterniflora (SA). Potential methane production (PMP), potential methane oxidation (PMO), functional microbial abundance and soil biogeochemical properties were measured simultaneously. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion could dramatically increase soil CH4 emissions mainly due to the enhancement in PMP which facilitated by soil EC, MBC, TOC and mcrA gene abundance. Additionally, S. alterniflora invasion decreases soil CO2 emission. Both heterotrophic microbial respiration (165 rRNA) and methane oxidation (pmoA and ANME-pmoA) are responsible for CO2 emission reduction. Furthermore, S. alterniflora invasion greatly increases GWP by stimulating CH4 emissions. Thus, comparing with mangroves, invasive S. alterniflora significantly (p < 0.001) increases CH4 emission while reduces CO2 emission.

AB  - Many coastal wetlands are subject to the combined effects of reduced sediment input and increased nutrient loads from watersheds. Restoration strategies focused on increasing marsh elevation and acreage can involve adding sediment through dredge sediment deposition or diversion of river water. It is unclear, however, how sediment inputs influence plant productivity in areas also receiving high nutrient loads. We tested the hypothesis that productivity of Spartina patens is greater with both nutrient and sediment addition than either or neither in a greenhouse experiment. Soil organic matter and nitrogen concentrations were predicted to increase with nutrient addition, but decrease with sediment addition. Plants experienced one of two levels of sediment deposition (control and 4 applications of 2cm river silt) within either nutrient-enriched (6.96 N, 1.82 P, 1.82Kmg/L) or control tanks. Spartina patens exhibited nearly double the height, stem density, and aboveground biomass in nutrient treatments as compared to controls. Belowground biomass was also stimulated by nutrient-enrichment. Sedimentation reduced the emergence of new stems, but increased fine root biomass. Nutrient enrichment further stimulated root and rhizome growth into added surface sediment. Despite a large plant response to added nutrients, soil properties were unaffected by nutrient-enrichment.

AB  - Evaluating the degree of metal exposure and bioaccumulation in estuarine organisms is important for understanding the fate of metals in estuarine food webs. We investigated the bioaccumulation of Hg, methylmercury (MeHg), Cd, Se, Pb, and As in common intertidal organisms across a watershed urbanization gradient of coastal marsh sites in New England to relate metal exposure and bioaccumulation in fauna to both chemical and ecological factors. In sediments, we measured metal and metalloid concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) and SEM-AVS (Simultaneously extracted metal-acid volatile sulfides). In five different functional feeding groups of biota, we measured metal concentrations and delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures. Concentrations of Hg and Se in biota for all sites were always greater than sediment concentrations whereas Pb in biota was always lower. There were positive relationships between biota Hg concentrations and sediment concentrations, and between biota MeHg concentrations and both pelagic feeding mode and trophic level. Bioavailability of all metals measured as SEM-AVS or Benthic-Sediment Accumulation Factor was lower in more contaminated sites, likely due to biogeochemical factors related to higher levels of sulfides and organic carbon in the sediments. Our study demonstrates that for most metals and metalloids, bioaccumulation is metal specific and not directly related to sediment concentrations or measures of bioavailability such as AVS-SEM.

AB  - Although embankment reclamation is a recurring activity in the coastal wetlands of China, the effect of embankment construction on plant growth has attracted little attention. Leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry (C-N-P stoichiometry) of a plant can be used to reflect plant adaptation to new environments created by reclamation. In the present study we investigated the biomass and leaf C-N-P stoichiometry of Spartina alterniflora Loisel., soil C-N-P stoichiometry and soil moisture, salinity, bulk density and pH in both embankment-reclaimed and natural S. alterniflora salt marshes in eastern China. Plant biomass, leaf P content, soil salinity and soil moisture were significantly lower in the reclaimed compared with natural marsh. The decrease in leaf P content is possibly attributed to changes in soil salinity, soil moisture and soil organic C and N content in the reclaimed marsh. The results of the present study indicate that the decreased aboveground biomass in the reclaimed marsh is likely to be correlated with an increase in the leaf N:P ratio, in accordance with the growth rate hypothesis'. However, previously published threshold values of the N:P ratio as indicators of N or P limitation of plant growth may not be applicable to S. alterniflora at our study site.

AB  - Over the past century, conversion to agriculture has greatly reduced the global extent of coastal wetlands leading to degradation and loss of these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how this land conversion affects the confluent soil organic and inorganic carbon (SOC and SIC) storage as well as their localizations in soil matrix. Here, we investigated these issues using wet sieving at two coastal saline-alkali sites in northern China. Conversion of marshes to cropland (>60 years) decreased the portion of large macroaggregates (>2 mm) and correspondingly increased the portion of microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm) at both sites. Land conversion decreased SOC contents by 31-67% in all fractions (>2, 0.25-2, 0.053-0.25, and <0.053 mm) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm). In contrast, irrigation- and NH4HCO3 fertilization-derived carbonates increased SIC storages in almost all fractions due to the saline-alkali soil conditions, especially for the subsoil. This increases in SIC almost offset and compensate for the SOC losses at both sites. Consequently, the irrigation- and NH4HCO3-induced SIC accumulation should be included in the full C balance of saline-alkali soils. It should be noted, however, that the progressive loss of SOC due to cultivation will lead to soil degradation in fertility and ecological function, thereby hampering long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems. Therefore, the compensation of SIC for the loss of SOC is not sustainable in the longer term.

AB  - Food web structure and major sources of primary production consumed by metafauna of Mad Island Marsh, a coastal saltmarsh on the NW coast of the Gulf of Mexico, were compared using stable isotopes and dietary analysis. Carbon and nitrogen isotope data were entered into a mixing model containing 5 potential production sources. Results were inconclusive due to overlapping isotopic signatures of certain sources, but nonetheless indicated that most fishes and macroinvertebrates assimilated material derived mostly from variable mixtures of macrophytes and filamentous algae. Highest estimates of percentage of material assimilated directly or indirectly from C-4 marsh grasses (ranging from 30 to 82 %) were for spot Leiostomus xanthurus and Gulf killifish Fundulus grandis. Isotopic analysis could not reveal the detailed structure of predator-prey interactions at the species level; greater detail of trophic pathways was revealed by the dietary analysis. Estimates of vertical web structure (species trophic levels) by the 2 methods were largely concordant. The exceptions were 2 zooplanktivorous and detritivorous fish species and grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio that had higher trophic levels according to nitrogen isotope ratios. For these taxa, the isotopic method more accurately indexed the number of trophic transfers than the dietary method, which depends on accurate dietary estimation for all food chain components leading to a consumer, and which assumes equal assimilation efficiencies for items found in stomach contents. The isotopic method underestimated trophic levels of several invertebrates, possibly due to inaccurate estimation of mean delta N-15 for production sources supporting these taxa and/or differential trophic fractionation. Together, stable isotope and dietary analyses provide a more accurate assessment of food web structure and dynamics of coastal marsh ecosystems than either method alone.

AB  - Sediment metabolism (surface O2 uptake and CO2 production) and S-35-SO4(2-) reduction (0 to 10 cm) were measured during January 1990 (dry season) at 3 stations in the Ao Nam Bor mangrove, Phuket, Thailand. Sulfate reduction as measured by the chromium reduction technique was highest at 6 to 10 cm depth at all stations (600 to 800 nmol S Cm-3 d-1), indicating that significant activity may have occurred below 10 cm. Vertical translocation of metabolizable organic substrates, either due to subsurface root growth or due to downward transport of newly deposited organic matter by bioturbation appeared responsible for the high subsurface activity. The major reduced sulfur compound at all 3 stations was FeS2, both as recovered S-35-label in the sulfate reduction assay (82 to 97 %) and in the total sediment sulfur pool (86 to 100 %). Very low amounts of reduced sulfur were found as HS-, FeS and S-degrees. The general absence of HS- was caused by precipitation reactions controlled by a large sedimentary iron pool. The estimated areal based rates of sulfate reduction (0 to 10 cm, 28 to 50 mmol m-2 d-1) could support around 100 % (65 to 142 %) of the measured CO2 flux across the sediment-water interface. This implies a deficient or non-steady state CO2 flux since the sulfate reduction estimate ignored any activity occurring below 10 cm depth. Possible causes for this deficit may include CO2 assimilation by roots, advective loss of pore water CO2, and excessive CO2 gas loss during air exposure. In general, the mechanisms underlying carbon and sulfur cycling in this mangrove swamp appears remarkably similar to those operating in salt marshes.

AB  - The exotic C-4 grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to tidal coastal wetlands in Jiangsu province of China in 1982. Since then it has rapidly replaced the native C-3 plant Suaeda salsa, becoming one of the dominant vegetation types in the coastal wetlands of China. Although plant invasion can change soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, little is known about how plant invasion influences C storage within soil fractions. We investigated how S. altemiflora invasion across an 8, 12 and 14-year chronosequence affected SOC and soil nitrogen (N), using soil fractionation and stable delta C-13 isotope analyses. SOC and N concentrations at 0-10 cm depth in S. altemiflora soil increased during the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence, ranging from 3.67 to 4.90 g C kg(-1) soil, and from 0.307 to 0.391 g N kg(-1) soil. These were significantly higher than the values in the Suaeda salsa community, by 27.0-69.6% for SOC. and 21.8-55.2% for total N. The S. alterniflora-derived SOC varied from 0.40 to 0.92 g C kg(-1) according to mixing calculations, assuming the two possible SOC sources of S. alterniflora and S. salsa, and accounted for 10.8-18.7% of total SOC in the colonized soils. The estimated accumulative rate of SOC from C-4 (S. alterniflora) was 64.1 C kg(-1) soil year(-1) and from C-3 sources was 78.1 mg C kg(-1). The concentration of S. alterniflora-derived SOC significantly decreased from coarse fraction to fine fraction, and linearly increased as the period of S. alterniflora invasion increased. The highest accumulative rate of SOC from a C-4 source occurred in macroaggregates, while the highest rate from C-3 was in microaggregates. The storage of SOC derived from S. alterniflora in the macroaggregates was 0.27-0.44 g C kg(-1) soil, accounting for 43.1-49.1% of the total C(4)derived SOC in the soil. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion in coastal wetlands could facilitate SOC storage, because of the high potential for accumulation of the C which has been newly derived from S. alterniflora litter and roots.

AB  - Knowledge about geochemical fractions of vanadium (V) in different soils is required to understand its potential mobilization which we assessed in thirteen soil profiles originating from Germany and Egypt using the sequential extraction technique of the Commission of the European Communities Bureau of Reference (BCR). The concentrations of total, AB-DTPA-extractable, and the geochemical fractions [acid soluble (F1), reducible (F2), oxidisable (F3), and residual (F4) fraction] of V in the soils were determined. The total V concentrations ranged from 20.7 to 133.1 mg kg(-1) and correlated positively with clay content and the total concentrations of iron (Fe-t), aluminum (Al-t), and manganese (Mn-t). The total V was stronger affected by free Fe and Mn oxides (Fe-d and Mn-d) in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils. The residual fraction of V was dominant in the soils followed by the reducible and the oxidisable fraction and showed a similar behavior to total V. The reducible V was higher in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils and was positively correlated with Fe-t, Al-t, Mn-t, Fe-d, and Mn-d. The impact of Fe-t, Al-t, and Mn-t on the reducible V was stronger in the Egyptian soils than in the German soils, while the impact of Fe-d and Mn-d on the reducible V was stronger in the German soils than Egyptian soils. The oxidisable V was affected by soil organic matter and total sulphur (S-t) in the German soils and by carbonates and S-t in the Egyptian soils. The acid soluble fraction of V was lower than the detection limits in all soils. The AB-DTPA-extractable V concentrations (potential available V) ranged between 0.04 and 4.04 mg kg(-1). The potential mobile fraction (PMF = Sigma F1-F3) accounted 4.4-64.7% of the total V. The alkaline soils showed the highest potential mobility and availability of V compared to the acidic soils, and thus the AB-DTPA-extractable V correlated positively with soil pH as well as clay content, cation exchange capacity, and Fe-t. The reducible fraction contributed stronger to the potential mobility and availability of V than the oxidisable fraction. The canonical discrimination analysis explained 64% of the variability of the geochemical behavior of the different soil groups and showed that the different groups of soils could differentiate from each other. The German soil groups (Eutric Fluvisols, Calcic Luvisols, Tidalic Fluvisol and Haplic Gleysol (Marsh soils)), showed a different geochemical behavior; while the Egyptian Eutric Fluvisols and Sodic Fluvisols were relatively similar in their geochemical behavior and the Haplic Calcisols was relatively close to them. Our results demonstrate that the potential mobilization of V was high in the soils (except for Luvisols) - especially under alkaline conditions-which indicate a release of this toxic metal from the soils to soil solution. This release may cause potential environmental risks such as the transfer of V into the groundwater, the vegetation and food chain. Future studies should elucidate the temporal kinetics of V and the determining factors under different flooding conditions and remediation approaches are necessary to ameliorate V-contaminated soils.

AB  - The structure and diversity of the bacterial communities in rhizosphere soils of native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter and alien Spartina alterniflora in the Yangtze River Estuary were investigated by constructing 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clone libraries. The bacterial diversity was quantified by placing the clones into operational taxonomic unit (OTU) groups at the level of sequence similarity of > 97%. Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting 398 clone sequences indicated a high diversity of bacteria in the rhizosphere soils of these plants. The members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria of the phylum Proteobacteria were the most abundant in rhizobacteria. Chao I nonparametric diversity estimator coupled with the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) was applied to sequence data obtained from each library to evaluate total sequence diversity and quantitatively compare the level of dominance. The results showed that Phragmites, Scirpus, and Spartina rhizosphere soils contained 200, 668, and 382 OTUs, respectively. The bacterial communities in the Spartina and Phragmites rhizosphere soils displayed species dominance revealed by 1/D, whereas the bacterial community in Scirpus rhizosphere soil had uniform distributions of species abundance. Overall, analysis of 16S rDNA clone libraries from the rhizosphere soils indicates that the changes in bacterial composition may occur concomitantly with the shift of species composition in plant communities.

AB  - One hundred and twenty-one samples were collected in three estuaries of the Huelva littoral (SW Spain). The 12,923 individuals picked were assigned to forty-seven species. The analysis of the foraminiferal percentages allows the distinction of seven assemblages: two salt marsh assemblages (Trochammina inflata and Jadammina macrescens), four assemblages widely represented both in the channel margins and the channels (Ammonia inflata Astrononion stelligerum, Cribroelphidium vadescens, Ammonia ammoniformis) and one marginal marine assemblage (Ammonia beccarii-Quinqueloculina spp). The distribution of these assemblages is controlled by the salinity, the altitude above the lowest tidal level and, to a lesser extent, by the grain size, organic matter and the test transport. In the Tinto-Odiel estuary, both effects of heavy metal pollution and sedimentary changes in the foraminiferal distribution were analyzed, indicating some recuperation mainly in the Odiel river, one of the most polluted areas of the world.

AB  - Coastal ecologists and managers have frequently used nitrogen stable isotopes (N-15) to trace and monitor sources of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) in coastal ecosystems. However, the interpretation of N-15 data can often be challenging, as the isotope values fractionate substantially due to preferential retention and uptake by biota. There is a growing body of evidence that carbon isotopes may be a useful alternative indicator for eutrophication, as they may be sensitive to changes in primary production that result from anthropogenic nutrient inputs. We provide three examples of systems where C-13 values sensitively track phytoplankton production. First, earlier (1980s) mesocosm work established positive relationships between C-13 and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved silica concentrations. Consistent with these findings, a contemporary mesocosm experiment designed to replicate a temperate intertidal salt marsh environment also demonstrated that the system receiving supplementary nutrient additions had higher nutrient concentrations, higher chlorophyll concentrations, and higher C-13 values. This trend was particularly pronounced during the growing season, with differences less evident during senescence. And finally, these results were replicated in the open waters of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, during a spring phytoplankton bloom. These three examples, taken together with the pre-existing body of literature, suggest that, at least in autotrophic, phytoplankton-dominated systems, C-13 values can be a useful and sensitive indicator of eutrophication.

AB  - Pollen, benthic foraminifera, diatoms, sediment grain size, and organic matter content from a 230-cm long-AMS dated sediment core (Core SB-51B) were used to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes and paleoclimatic evolution within the Seal Beach wetland (southern California, USA), during the last similar to 2000 years. A Q-mode cluster analysis based on diatom and foraminiferal data identified three distinct units: 1) the lowest sandy to silty-sand unit deposited before 1838 cal years BP (230 -140 cm in depth) is devoid of microfossils; 2) a clay rich intermediate unit dated between 1838 and 513 cal years BP (140-52 cm) is dominated by brackish and brackish-marine diatoms and foraminifera; and 3) a clay-rich zone deposited after 513 cal years BP(52 cm to the surface) contains high salt marsh adapted microfossils. Fresh-water and salt-tolerant diatoms from Unit 2 indicated several fresh-water influx events at 105 cm, 82 cm, and 75 cm possibly from a nearby stream. A shift from saltmarsh plants to terrestrial plants was inferred by pollen analysis. Throughout the record, the pine pollen increases suggest a shift towards cooler and wetter conditions during the last 300 years. Regional pollen records support our findings indicating a trend from drier conditions during the last 1800 years to the cooler, more mesic conditions of the Little Ice Age. The analyzed sedimentary sequence indicated the possible occurrence of three seismic events during the Late Holocene: E3 and E2 before 1760 cal years BP and E1, which took place just prior to 390 cal years BP.

AB  - Although invasions by non-native species represent a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of these invasions on methane (CH4) emission and its C-13-CH4-isotope signature in salt marshes. An invasive perennial C-4 grass Spartina alterniflora has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction from North America in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha Island in the Yangtze River estuary in 1997, S. alterniflora monocultures have become the dominant component of the Jiuduansha's vegetation, where monocultures of the native plant Scirpus mariqueter (a C-3 grass) used to dominate the vegetation for more than 30 years. We investigated seasonal variation in soil CH4 emission and its C-13-CH4-isotope signature from S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter marshes. The results obtained here show that S. alterniflora invasion increased soil CH4 emissions compared to native S. mariqueter, possibly resulting from great belowground biomass of S. alterniflora, which might have affected soil microenvironments and /or CH4 production pathways. CH4 emissions from soils in both marshes followed similar seasonal patterns in CH4 emissions that increased significantly from April to August and then decreased from August to October. CH4 emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, but negatively correlated with soil moisture for both S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter soils (p < 0.05). The delta C-13 values of CH4 from S. alterniflora, and S. mariqueter soils ranged from -39.0aEuro degrees to -45.0aEuro degrees, and -37.3aEuro degrees to -45.7aEuro degrees, respectively, with the lowest delta C-13 values occurring in August in both marshes. Although the leaves, roots and soil organic matter of S. alterniflora had significantly higher delta C-13 values than those of S. mariqueter, S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change the C-13- isotopic signature of soil emitted CH4 (p > 0.05). Generally, the CH4 emissions from both invasive S. alterniflora and native S. mariqueter soils in the salt marshes of Jiuduansha Island were very low (0.01-0.26 mg m(-2) h(-1)), suggesting that S. alterniflora invasion along the east coast of China may not be a significant potential source of atmospheric CH4.

AB  - Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF; concentration in organism lipid/concentration in sediment on an organic carbon basis) of polyaromatic hydrocarbons varied with season and along an intertidal gradient in a coastal marsh in San Francisco Bay. The BSAFs were lowest during the local rainy season. During the dry season, BSAFs were lowest in the high intertidal zone closest to shore. Significant differences among species groups were also observed; BSAFs were lowest in polychaetes and highest in the asian clam (Potamocorbula amurensis), varying over almost three orders of magnitude (0.0069-5.4 g sediment organic C/g lipid). The BSAFs decreased with increasing percent fines in the sediments and with PAH concentrations on an organic carbon basis. We suggest that a determining variable is the content of highly aromatic soot particles, which increases during periods of surface runoff and which is expected in the dry season to be highest in the high intertidal zone where these finer particles preferentially accumulate. Correlations of BSAFs with the ratio of the logarithm of the activity coefficients in porewaters to those in sediments were generally stronger than with log K-ow indicating a limitation of octanol as a surrogate for sediment organic carbon or organism lipid. These observations qualify but also strengthen the concept of equilibrium partitioning as the determining factor in bioaccumulation by benthic organisms of nonpolar organic compounds from sediments; the assumption that ''organic carbon'' can be considered in generic terms without allowance for aromaticity and probably other factors as well, must, however, be reconsidered.

AB  - We investigated seasonal patterns of photosynthetic responses to CO2 concentrations in Spartina alterniflora Loisel, an aerenchymous halophyte grass, from a salt marsh of the Bay of Fundy (NB, Canada), and from plants grown from rhizome in controlled-environment chambers. From late May to August, CO2 compensation concentrations (Gamma) of field-grown leaves varied between 2.5-10.7 cm(3) (CO2) m(-3), with a mean of 5.4 cm(3)(CO2) m(-3). From September onwards field leaves showed CO2 compensation concentrations from 6.6-21.1 cm(3) (CO2) m(-3), with a mean of 13.1 cm(3) m(-3) Well into the C-3-C-4 intermediate range. The seasonal variability in Gamma did not result from changing respiration, but rather from a sigmoidal response of net photosynthetic rate (P-N) to applied CO2 concentration, found in all tested leaves but which became more pronounced late in the season. One explanation for the sigmoidal response of P-N to external CO2 concentration could be internal delivery Of CO2 from roots and rhizomes to bundle sheath cells via the acrenchyma, but the sigmoidal responses in S. alterniflora persisted out to the tips of leaves, while the aerenchyma extend only to midleaf. The siginoidicity persisted when CO2 response curves were measured from low to high CO2, or from high to low CO2, and even when prolonged acclimation times were used at each CO2 concentration.

AB  - We report substantial tidal fluxes of dissolved black carbon (DBC) in a fire-affected marsh in the northern Gulf of Mexico. DBC was molecularly determined as benzenepolycarboxylic acids in a tidal creek, adjacent rivers, and the coastal ocean. Supported by stable carbon isotope and in situ fluorescence measurements, three sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were identified that mixed conservatively in the coastal system: groundwater from salt marshes, river water, and seawater. Groundwater was the main source of DBC to the creek. The highest DBC concentrations of up to 41 mu mol C L-1 (7.2% of DOC) were found in the creek at low tide, compared with < 18 mu mol C L-1 in all other samples. Over the studied tidal cycle, we determined a runoff (load per drainage area) of 3700 moles DBC (44 kg C) km(-2) of salt marsh. This is high compared with the Apalachicola River, where the annual DBC runoff is on the order of 10(4) mol (120 kg C) km(-2) yr(-1). In the marsh, it would require similar to 20 tidal cycles similar to the one that we studied to remove all black carbon produced during one fire event. Because a spring tide was studied, our estimate is as an upper limit. DBC is ubiquitous in the global ocean, and dissolution and subsequent lateral transport appear to be important removal mechanisms for soil black carbon. Our study, which provides a snapshot in time and space, demonstrates that tidal fluxes may be primary carriers of DBC, and therefore tidal pumping and groundwater discharge cannot be ignored in assessing the continental runoff of DBC.

AB  - The pH, alkalinity (Alk), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in estuarine waters of several rivers of Georgia in the southeastern United States are reported. Although they discharge into a narrow area in the South Atlantic Eight, the rivers along the coast of Georgia differ significantly in their drainage area (piedmont rivers vs. coastal plain rivers), chemical composition (contents of carbonate and humics), and discharge rates. Large differences in pH, DIG, and Alk between these rivers clearly reflect the differences of material inputs to the rivers. Dramatic pH increases in the early stage of mixing (more obvious for the coastal plain rivers) reflect the low buffering capacity of the river waters despite the high content of humic substances. Flux of riverine DIC to the South Atlantic Eight is estimated to be 52.5 X 10(9) mol yr(-1). We suggest that the presently available world total riverine DIC flux to the ocean could have much uncertainty if the small river fluxes are important. Calculated pCO(2) values from the pH and DIC measurements are extremely high in low-salinity areas (1,000 to >6,000 mu atm at salinity <10) as are the corresponding CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere (20 to >250 mol m(-2) yr(-1) at salinity <10). Data presented suggest that the most Likely causes that sustain the high pCO(2) values and high water-to-air fluxes in the estuaries are CO2 inputs from organic carbon respiration in the tidally flooded salt marshes and groundwater.

AB  - Sedimentary organic matter (OM) origin and molecular composition provide useful information to understand carbon cycling in coastal wetlands. Core sediments from threors' Contributionse transects along Ria Formosa lagoon intertidal zone were analysed using analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) to determine composition, distribution and origin of sedimentary OM. The distribution of alkyl compounds (alkanes, alkanoic acids and alkan-2-ones), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), lignin-derived methoxyphenols, linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), steranes and hopanes indicated OM inputs to the intertidal environment from natural-autochthonous and allochthonous-as well as anthropogenic. Several n-alkane geochemical indices used to assess the distribution of main OM sources (terrestrial and marine) in the sediments indicate that algal and aquatic macrophyte derived OM inputs dominated over terrigenous plant sources. The lignin-derived methoxyphenol assemblage, dominated by vinylguaiacol and vinylsyringol derivatives in all sediments, points to large OM contribution from higher plants. The spatial distributions of PAHs (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) showed that most pollution sources were mixed sources including both pyrogenic and petrogenic. Low carbon preference indexes (CPI > 1) for n-alkanes, the presence of UCM (unresolved complex mixture) and the distribution of hopanes (C-29-C-36) and steranes (C-27-C-29) suggested localized petroleum-derived hydrocarbon inputs to the core sediments. Series of LABs were found in most sediment samples also pointing to domestic sewage anthropogenic contributions to the sediment OM.

AB  - Ascomycetous fungi are predominant secondary microbial producers of the smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) shoot decay system. A 3-yr examination of concentrations of living fungal mass (as ergosterol content) in naturally decaying cordgrass, and of instantaneous rates of cordgrass-fungal production las rates of incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into ergosterol at a standard temperature of 20 degreesC), was conducted in three salt-marsh watersheds of Sapelo Island. Though the years of study were climatologically different (e.g., rainfall ranging over a factor similar to2), ergosterol content of decaying leaves was not different from year to year, with a grand mean of 371 mug ergosterol g(-1) organic mass of decaying system, and there was little difference among yearly average fungal productivities (range = 155-217 mug fungal organic mass g(-1) system organic mass h(-1) for autumn-spring data). Significant differences in ergosterol content of decaying leaves were found among marsh watersheds, probably due to differences in nitrogen (but not phosphorus) availability, but these were not large (maximum 1.3-fold for multiseasonal data, and differences were not found among marsh subsites (short to tall shoot) nor, for the most part, among types or parts of decaying leaves. Season of sampling, however, had a large effect upon fungal biomass and g-1 organic mass of decaying blades) than in summer or autumn (<310 <mu>g g(-1)). Among the potential reasons for this unexpected pattern of seasonality might be (1) greater access of mycophagous invertebrates and/or bacterial competitors due to higher tides and lower elevation of leaves in late summer and fall, and (2) leaching of leaf digestate during periods of high rainfall and high spring tides. Significant correlations were found between ergosterol content of decaying leaves and mean tidal height for the 3 months before sampling (r = -0.77) and for fungal productivities and 3-month rainfall (r- = -0.62). Grazing of decaying leaves by salt-marsh periwinkles over the range of snail densities of the study sites (0-85 m(-2)) gave no clear evidence of depression of fungal biomass or repression of fungal activity, contrary to previous findings for higher snail densities. The calculated seasonal change in living fungal percentage of decaying leaves was from similar to6 (summer-autumn) to 9% (winter-spring), and in 6-month fungal production, the change was from 101 to 434 g organic fungal mass m(-2) marsh surface.

AB  - This research investigates the level and degradation of oil at ten selected Gulf saltmarsh sites months after the 2010 BP Macondo-1 well oil spill. Very high levels (10-28%) of organic carbon within the heavily oiled sediments are clearly distinguished from those in pristine sediments (<3%). Dissolved organic carbon in contaminated pore waters, ranging up to hundreds of mg/kg, are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those at pristine sites. Heavily oiled sediments are characterized by very high sulfide concentrations (up to 80 mg/kg) and abundance of sulfate reducing bacteria. Geochemical biomarkers and stable carbon isotope analyses fingerprint the presence of oils in sediments. Ratios of selected parameters calculated from the gas chromatograph spectra are in a remarkable narrow range among spilled oils and initial BP crude. At oiled sites dominated by C-4 plants, delta C-13 values of sediments (-20.8 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand) have been shifted significantly lower compared to marsh plants (-14.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) due to the inflow of isotopically lighter oil (-27 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand). Our results show that (1) lighter compounds of oil are quickly degraded by microbes while the heavier fractions of oil still remain and (2) higher inputs of organic matter from the oil spill enhance the key microbial processes associated with sulfate reducing bacteria.

AB  - In New England, the marsh platform sits above mean high water and is flooded about 8 times a month. This high marsh, dominated by Spartina patens, has a vertical accretion rate of similar to 2.5 mm/yr, significantly lower than the 6-7 mm/yr accretion rate of low marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora. Accelerating sea-level rise will eventually cause the high marsh to transition to low marsh; the rate of this change is controlled, in part, by the contribution of inorganic sediment. Temporal and spatial variability of inorganic marsh sedimentation during the past similar to 2.5 ka was examined at the Great Marsh, Massachusetts, using twenty cores, each similar to 180cm long, along five transects. Transects were aligned perpendicular to bays and major channels at different compass quadrants to assess influences of wind and tidal flow during storms. Cores were sampled every 20 cm to determine percent organic matter (loss on ignition) and grain size distribution (using a laser particle size analyzer). Data show a weak correlation for grain size versus distance from the nearest channel or bay. Additionally, no consistent vertical trends in grain size were observed, either within individual sampling sites nor among coring transects. Instead, we find coarsening upwards trends at some sites, likely due to increased channelization and tidal velocity as the marsh matured. Elsewhere, sediments fine upwards in response to deepening bays and channels. Finally, transects exhibiting variable grain size trends are likely influenced by ice rafted sediment. These results demonstrate the complexity of sedimentation on the marsh platform and the challenge in accurately predicting patterns of sediment transport using a single suspended grain size in hydrodynamic models in these systems.

AB  - Tidal wetlands, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, are hotspots for carbon sequestration. The preservation of organic matter (OM) is a critical process by which tidal wetlands exert influence over the global carbon cycle and at the same time gain elevation to keep pace with sealevel rise (SLR). The present study assessed the effects of temperature and relative sea level on the decomposition rate and stabilization of OM in tidal wetlands worldwide, utilizing commercially available standardized litter. While effects on decomposition rate per se were minor, we show strong negative effects of temperature and relative sea level on stabilization, as based on the fraction of labile, rapidly hydrolyzable OM that becomes stabilized during deployment. Across study sites, OM stabilization was 29 % lower in low, more frequently flooded vs. high, less frequently flooded zones. Stabilization declined by similar to 75% over the studied temperature gradient from 10.9 to 28.5 degrees C. Additionally, data from the Plum Island long-term ecological research site in Mas- sachusetts, USA, show a pronounced reduction in OM stabilization by > 70 % in response to simulated coastal eutrophication, confirming the potentially high sensitivity of OM stabilization to global change. We therefore provide evidence that rising temperature, accelerated SLR, and coastal eutrophication may decrease the future capacity of tidal wetlands to sequester carbon by affecting the initial transformations of recent OM inputs to soil OM.

AB  - ATMOSPHERIC dimethyl sulphide, arising from marine algae, cyanobacteria and salt marsh plants such as Spartina, is the principal sulphur compound entering the atmosphere from terrestrial and aquatic environments 1-6. Methanesulphonic acid (CH3SO3H; MSA) has been identified as a major product of the photochemical oxidation in the atmosphere of dimethyl sulphide 1-3, 5, 7-9. Dimethyl sulphide and MSA are thus predominantly, if not exclusively, biogenic in origin, and are the main gaseous links in the biogeochemical sulphur cycle. MSA is a stable compound, not undergoing photochemical decomposition 3, so its removal from the atmosphere is by wet and dry deposition. MSA partitions into the aerosol phase, as well as nucleating droplet formation, and is deposited in rain and snow. Analysis of Antarctic ice cores 10 gives evidence of its global deposition over many thousands of years. The subsequent fate of MSA deposited on land was unknown. Here we describe terrestrial bacteria that grow on MSA. Their activities in the natural environment would result in the mineralization of MSA to carbon dioxide and sulphate, thus completing our understanding of this part of the sulphur cycle.

AB  - There have been seven studies of canopy photosynthesis of plants grown in elevated atmospheric CO2: three of seed crops, two of forage crops and two of native plant ecosystems. Growth in elevated CO2 increased canopy photosynthesis in all cases. The relative effect of CO2 was correlated with increasing temperature: the least stimulation occurred in tundra vegetation grown at an average temperature near 10-degrees-C and the greatest in rice grown at 43-degrees-C. In soybean, effects of CO2 were greater during leaf expansion and pod fill than at other stages of crop maturation. In the longest running experiment with elevated CO2 treatment to date, monospecific stands of a C3 sedge, Scirpus olneyi (Grey), and a C4 grass, Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl., have been exposed to twice normal ambient CO2 concentrations for four growing seasons, in open top chambers on a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange per unit green biomass (NCE(b)) increased by an average of 48% throughout the growing season of 1988, the second year of treatment. Elevated CO2 increased net ecosystem carbon assimilation by 88% in the Scirpus olneyi community and 40% in the Spartina patens community.

AB  - Biological invasion has profoundly influenced coastal soil reservoirs of carbon. Previous carbon studies regarding biological invasion in coastal wetlands mainly focused on soil organic carbon; however, little is known about the mechanisms that control soil inorganic carbon (SIC, e.g., carbonates) variation. In order to explore our understanding, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate controlling mechanisms of SIC in response to Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) invasion in the east-central China coast, where there is a lack of native salt marsh species. A space-for-time substitution method was used to identify sampling sites, assuming it has the capability to quantify the soil-vegetation relationship along a gradient of the increasing S. alterniflora age (17 year). The results showed that soil inorganic carbon density (SICD) at the 0.3-0.6 m depth exhibited a decline under S. alterniflora invasion, while there was no substantial change at the depths of 0-0.3 m and 0.6-1 m. The majority of the variances in SICD changes could be explained by S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables. In SEM, S. alterniflora invasion, soil water content, and soil texture presented direct influence on SICD throughout the soil profile (i.e., to 1 m depth). Soil salinity presented direct influence on SICD in the upper 0.6 m soil, while pH played an important role in the depth of 0.6-1 m. These results highlight that dynamics of SIC processes are probably controlled by interactions among S. alterniflora invasion and key soil physicochemical variables.

AB  - DEVERRA tortuosa (Desf.) DC. is a common medicinal, grazing, and salt-tolerant desert plant that can grow in a variety of habitats. The current study aims to detect anatomical adaptation to stress factors in different organs of the D.tortuosa plant (salinity, and drought). The plant was collected in Egypt from 17 different locations representing seven different habitats (sand dunes, sand flats, salt marshes, wadi bed & slope, roadsides and cultivated lands). The effect of soil factors (soil texture, pH, EC, and organic matter) on the anatomical features of various plant organs (root, stem, and leaf) was investigated. Variations in plant anatomical features were observed in response to significant differences in soil parameters (EC, organic carbon, and ionic content) between desert habitats. According to CCA analysis, periderm thickness is correlated with changes in ion concentrations (Ca+2, K+, and Na+), whereas cortex width is correlated with changes in pH and organic matter content in roots. Meanwhile, the degree of salinity in the habitats is correlated with sclerification in the stem and the widest chlorenchyma cells. Thick epidermis and a large xylem area are required for salt excretion in leaf development, and water conservation is related to changes in moisture content. Reducing plant water loss in the studied desert habitats could explain D. tortuosa's successful growth and survival under such harsh conditions.

AB  - We analyzed bioavailability, photoreactivity, fluorescence, and isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) collected at 13 stations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta during various seasons to estimate the persistence of DOC from diverse shallow water habitat sources. Prospective large-scale wetland restorations in the Delta may change the amount of DOC available to the food web as well as change the quality of Delta water exported for municipal use. Our study indicates that DOC contributed by Delta sources is relatively refractory and likely mostly the dissolved remnants of vascular plant material from degrading soils and tidal marshes rather than phytoplankton production. Therefore, the prospective conversion of agricultural land into submerged, phytoplankton-dominated habitats may reduce the undesired export of DOC from the Delta to municipal users. A median of 10% of Delta DOC was rapidly utilizable by bacterioplankton. A moderate dose of simulated solar radiation (286 W m(-2) for 4 h) decreased the DOC bioavailability by an average of 40%, with a larger relative decrease in samples with higher initial DOC bioavailability. Potentially, a DOC-based microbial food web could support <= 0.6 x 10(9) g C of protist production in the Delta annually, compared to approximate to 17 x 10(9) g C phytoplankton primary production. Thus, DOC utilization via the microbial food web is unlikely to play an important role in the nutrition of Delta zooplankton and fish, and the possible decrease in DOC concentration due to wetland restoration is unlikely to have a direct effect on Delta fish productivity.

AB  - Trophic interactions at the basis of food webs, for instance between meiofauna, primary producers and bacteria, are key drivers of benthic energy fluxes. Yet both qualitative and quantitative information about meiofaunal resource utilization under in situ conditions is scant. By means of natural stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen and of fatty acid (FA) profiles, we examined the variability of in situ resource utilization of a range of harpacticoid copepod species from 5 stations in an estuarine intertidal area. These stations, located in different habitats, differed in sediment granulometry, resource availability, presence/absence of vegetation and other environmental variables, as well as in copepod species composition. Our goal was to describe interspecific differences among harpacticoid species, as well as spatio-temporal variability within species. Despite differences in resource availability between habitats, delta C-13 data clearly point at microphytobenthos (MPB) as the major carbon source to the harpacticoid assemblages at all 5 stations. Small differences in carbon isotopic ratios between co-occurring species indicate some degree of resource differentiation, whereas both the delta N-15 and FA composition suggest that several harpacticoid species obtain MPB carbon indirectly, perhaps through feeding on bacteria or ciliates. For a limited number of species, such as Paraleptastacus spinicauda, clear dietary contributions of suspended particulate matter and bacteria were found, and MPB appeared to have only a small or no contribution. Even in vegetated salt-marsh stations, Spartina anglica detritus did not appear to contribute to copepod diets. The delta C-13 of Cletodidae were highly depleted, reflecting a contribution of methane-derived carbon.

AB  - Sediments and benthic epifauna were examined at a coastal station (ca. 26 m water depth) located in the northwestern Adriatic Sea. Sediment cores were taken every 90 days from April 1995 to January 1996. Epifauna was further investigated by means of trophic traps deployed on the sea bottom. Sediments were characterized by the occurrence of coarse plant detritus derived from aquatic angiosperms (Zostera sp., Cymodocea nodosa) commonly distributed in lagoons and salt marshes of the Po delta area. The epifauna was dominated by the brackish amphipod Gammarus insensibilis Stock, whereas other taxa occurred in negligible densities (< 2% quantitative dominance). A positive relationship was found between coarse organic matter in sediments and G. insensibilis spatial abundance. Analyses of population parameters from core samples and of size-frequency distributions From trophic traps permitted to exclude passive dispersal as the causative factor for the constant, even though seasonally variable, presence of the amphipod in the benthic system. Our results provide clear evidence of an "outwelling" flux of particulate plant detritus linking brackish coastal areas to adjacent marine environments in the northwestern Adriatic Sea. Moreover,they give support to the hypothesis that advection of allochthonous particulate detritus in marine environments may determine an "estuarine" characterization of epifaunal soft-bottom assemblages.

AB  - Uca pugnax and U. pugilator are common fiddler crabs in salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States. As adults, U. pugnax frequent muddier, vegetated (typically Spartina alterniflora) substrate while U. pugilator usually occupy sandier, open habitats. It is unclear where juvenile U. pugnax and U. pugilator reside because the early crab stages of these species are difficult to identify by simple gross morphology. Using a novel restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) protocol to distinguish postlarval U. pugnax and U. pugilator, we studied their distribution along a horizontal gradient in the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina. We collected juvenile crabs along transects at 3 different sites that spanned S. alterniflora-covered mud and open sand habitats with adult populations of U. pugnax and U. pugilator, respectively. Over 75% of the juveniles collected were U. pugnax, showing greater recruitment by this species. U. pugnax juveniles of all sizes preferred the same muddy habitat occupied by adults, but habitat preferences of juvenile U. pugilator varied by site. Generally, U. pugilator displayed a shift in distribution from S. alterniflora cover to sandier habitat during early juvenile stages. The younger stages may prefer S. alterniflora-covered, muddier habitat because it provides better cover from predators, or so that they can avoid displacement by currents during high tides; alternatively, they may be able to feed better on muddy sediment. U. pugilator develops specialized mouthparts to scrape organic matter from larger sand grains, but these are not present in early juveniles nor in U. pugnax juveniles. Although young juvenile U. pugnax strongly favored S. alterniflora cover, older juveniles (those large enough to dig burrows for protection) were occasionally found in sandier habitat with U. pugilator.

AB  - Organic delta C-13 and C/N analyses of estuarine deposits provide proxies for changes in the source of organic matter, which can be driven by fluctuations in relative sea level, river discharge, and catchment disturbance. Here we present the results of a comprehensive vegetation and sediment delta C-13 and C/N survey of Welwich Marsh (outer Humber Estuary, UK), together with high-resolution delta C-13 and C/N analyses of Holocene cores collected nine years previously from the Humber Estuary and the Lincolnshire Marshes, Eastern England, UK. The contemporary intertidal delta C-13 and C/N dataset shows a gradual increase in surface sediment delta C-13 with decreasing marsh height and suggests that delta C-13 is controlled by the degree of tidal inundation and thus reflects organic matter source. However, sediment C/N ratios are less sensitive to tidal changes and the recent introduction Of C-4 salt-marsh species complicates the contemporary analogue. The Holocene delta C-13 and C/N records are in general agreement with existing microfossil data and provide additional palacoenvironmental information. This includes support for an estuary-wide expansion of marine conditions from c. 3.3 ka cal. yr BP, followed by a contraction of marine conditions after c. 2.7 ka cal. yr BP, and evidence for an increase in delivery of terrigenous organic matter to the inner estuary in the late Holocene. Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis is shown to be a reliable and independent indicator of coastal environmental change and is therefore a complementary technique to the more commonly used microfossil approach. However, this study also shows that in some circumstances the technique may be compromised when applied to sediments from cores that have been stored for a period of time.

AB  - Holocene evolution of the Ria Formosa barrier island system was studied through the examination of a large subsurface dataset acquired from 191 boreholes and five seismic refraction profiles. Two boreholes with total depths of 26 and 16.5 m were selected for a multi-proxy detailed laboratory analysis, including mean grain size distribution, organic matter (OM) content, color variation, shell identification, and benthic foraminifera assemblages. Selected cores are thought to be representative of the identified depositional sub-basins. Subsurface age data from 16 AMS C-14 dated samples were plotted against depth and resulted in a coherent age model of sedimentary infill. The system evolution was largely controlled by sediment availability, accommodation space, and Holocene sea level rise, first at a rapid rate of 7 mm/yr from 10 kcal yr BP to 7.25 kcal yr BP, followed by a slowdown to 1.1 mm/yr until present. A conceptual model for the origin and Holocene evolution of the Ria Formosa barrier island system implies three main steps, leading to the present system geomorphology: (1) marine flooding of incised palaeovalleys by the rapid transgression of palaeovalleys in the early Holocene; (2) development of a proto-barrier island chain perched on Pleistocene detritic headlands and steeper interfluve areas during the early to middle Holocene; and (3) full development of the barrier islands chain and enclosing of the coastal lagoon, followed by the maturation of the system with subsequent siltation and salt marsh expansion from the middle Holocene until present. The onset of barrier system formation dates back to ca. 8 kcal yr BP, predating previously proposed age.

AB  - There is consensus that temperature plays a major role in shaping microbial activity, but there are still questions as to how temperature influences different aspects of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism under different environmental conditions. We examined the temperature dependence of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism, whether this temperature dependence changes at different temperatures, and whether the relationship between temperature and carbon metabolism varies among estuarine sub-systems differing in their degree of enrichment. Two years of intensive sampling in a temperate estuary (Monie Bay, Chesapeake Bay, USA) revealed significant differences in the temperature dependence of bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), which drove a strong negative temperature response of bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). Accordingly, BGE was lower in summer (< 0.2) and higher in winter (> 0.5). For all measured metabolic processes, the most pronounced temperature response was observed at lower temperatures, with Q(10) values generally 2-f old greater than in warmer waters. Despite significant differences in resource availability, both the temperature dependence and magnitude of BR and bacterioplankton carbon consumption (BCC) were remarkably similar among the 4 estuarine sub-systems. Although temperature dependencies of BP and BGE were also similar, their magnitude differed significantly, with highest values in the nutrient-enriched sub-system and lowest in the open bay. This pattern in carbon metabolism among subsystems was present throughout the year and was confirmed by temperature manipulation experiments, suggesting the temperature effects on BP and BGE did not override the influence of resource availability, We conclude that temperature is the dominant factor regulating seasonality of BR and BCC in this system, whereas BP and BGE are influenced by both temperature and organic matter quality, with variation in the relative importance of each of these factors throughout the year.

AB  - Coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) constitute a serious and global environmental problem. Oxidation of iron sulfide minerals exposed to air generates sulfuric acid with consequently negative impacts on coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Tidal inundation represents one current treatment strategy for CASS, with the aim of neutralizing acidity by triggering microbial iron- and sulfate-reduction and inducing the precipitation of iron-sulfides. Although well-known functional guilds of bacteria drive these processes, their distributions within CASS environments, as well as their relationships to tidal cycling and the availability of nutrients and electron acceptors, are poorly understood. These factors will determine the long-term efficacy of "passive" CASS remediation strategies. Here we studied microbial community structure and functional guild distribution in sediment cores obtained from 10 depths ranging from 0 to 20 cm in three sites located in the supra-, inter- and sub-tidal segments, respectively, of a CASS-affected salt marsh (East Trinity, Cairns, Australia). Whole community 16S rRNA gene diversity within each site was assessed by 454 pyrotag sequencing and bioinformatic analyses in the context of local hydrological, geochemical, and lithological factors. The results illustrate spatial overlap, or close association, of iron-, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in an environment rich in organic matter and controlled by parameters such as acidity, redox potential, degree of water saturation, and mineralization. The observed spatial distribution implies the need for empirical understanding of the timing, relative to tidal cycling, of various terminal electron-accepting processes that control acid generation and biogeochemical iron and sulfur cycling.

AB  - The Patos Estuary, in southern Brazil, is subject to an irregular hydrological regime and receives mercury (Hg)-contaminated effluents from the city of Rio Grande since the colonial period of southern Brazil. Aiming to investigate sulfate reduction effects over Hg geochemistry in a shallow area (SA) and a salt marsh (SM) from the Patos Estuary, four sediment cores were collected during two distinct hydrological regimes (i.e., freshwater dominated and brackish water dominated). An assessment of free dissolved sulfide (Sigma S-II) concentration and pH in pore water and metals (Fe and Hg), fine grained (<63 mu m) and organic carbon (OC) contents in sediment allowed us to conclude that mercury distribution in SA is chiefly controlled by <63 mu m sediments and metal sulfide formation. Furthermore, redox conditions were relatively stable during both sampling periods. Nevertheless, bioturbation promotes oxygen penetration and subsequent acidification of pore water associated with upper sediment layers in SM, especially during the brackish water period. Most likely, such oxidizing conditions hamper sulfate reduction and, thereafter, Hg immobilization via the formation of metal sulfides. No evidence of anthropogenic contamination was found in the studied sediments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KW  - implementation
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses provide important ecosystem services, including nursery habitat for fish, shoreline protection, and the recently recognized service of carbon sequestration and storage. When these wetland ecosystems are degraded or destroyed, the carbon can be released to the atmosphere, where it adds to the concentration of greenhouses gases (GHGs) that contribute to climate change. Many federal statutes and policies specifically require that impacts on ecosystem services be considered in policy implementation. Yet, no federal statute, regulation, or policy accounts directly for the carbon held in coastal habitats. There are a number of federal statutes and policies for which coastal carbon ecosystem services could reasonably be added to environmental and ecosystem considerations already implemented. We look at a subset of these statutes and policies to illustrate how coastal carbon ecosystem services and values might affect the implementation and outcomes of such statutes generally. We identify key steps for the inclusion of the ecosystem services of coastal habitats into the implementation of existing federal policies without statutory changes; doing so would increase the degree to which these policies consider the full economic and ecological impacts of policy actions.

AB  - Given the possibility of short-term changes in hydrological patterns caused by climatic change, there is a need to assess the effects of inundation frequency on soil nitrogen cycling in estuarine wetland ecosystems. Here, we performed soil/plant translocation experiments in Shanyu tidal marsh, China, and examined the effects of elevated and reduced frequencies of inundation on nitrogen cycling over a period of 90 days. Our results indicated that soil ammonia levels (14.35-25.37 mg N kg(-1)) showed similar responses to changes in inundation frequency, whereas after 60 days of elevated inundation frequency, nitrate levels (0.32-1.52 mg N kg(-1)) were lower by 42.72% compared with the initial levels, although there were no significant changes in nitrate levels in response to reduced inundation frequency. After 90 days, both nitrification and denitrification rates were observed to correspond to naturally occurring hydrological gradients, showing increases of 564.49% and 108.82%, respectively, in response to elevated inundation frequency, and decreases of -77.83% and -94.92%, respectively, in response to reduced inundation frequency. Moisture, Fe(II), Fe(III), electrical conductivity, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants were identified prominent factor contributing to the observed changes in nitrification and denitrification. Our findings highlight the likelihood of changes in nitrification and denitrification in response to short-term elevation or reduction inundation frequency.

AB  - The article presents the results for enrichment of total trace metals (TTMs) from Pallikaranai salt marsh in South Chennai, a metropolis on the southeast coast of India. TTMs Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Sr, V, and Hg along with sediment texture, OC, and CaCO(3) were analyzed in 36 surface sediments collected during August 2008 to recognize and observe the input of TTMs in the marsh from various sources in the city limits. In view of the rapid urbanization and industrialization in Chennai City, especially on the southern side, uncontrolled input of sewage, garbage, and industrial effluents into the Pallikaranai marsh land, the elevated concentrations are not surprising. The level of enrichment of TTMs has also increased by 20% to 60% for most of the elements when compared with all other ecosystems in the world as well as the nearby area. The results also indicate that the marshy region is more heavily contaminated with Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn than other regions on the southeast coast of India. The Enrichment Factor, Contamination Factor, and I (geo) indexes are calculated, and these values are useful to assess the degree of pollution in sediments. The spatial distributions of TTMs are also controlled by other factors like geochemical, precipitation, and flocculation of particulate substances in the marsh. The results of the present study suggest the need for a regular monitoring and management program which will help to improve the quality of Pallikaranai pristine marsh land.

AB  - Bacterial biomass, abundance, and productivity were greater in 3 tidal marsh creeks on the Chesapeake Bay side of the lower Delmarva Peninsula than in nearby creeks of the seaside coastal lagoon complex (biomass: 462 and 71 ng C ml-1; abundance: 12 x 10(6) and 3.8 x 10(6) cells ml-1; productivity: 46 and 7.3 ng C ml-1 h-1; bayside and seaside respectively). Bacterial cell-size distributions were also significantly different between the seaside and bayside creeks, with a larger proportion of smaller cells dominating samples from the seaside creeks. Bayside and seaside concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were similar (approximately 49 mg l-1 TSS and 3.5 mg l-1 DOC). The amount of organic matter (OM) and chlorophyll a was higher in the bayside creeks, while inorganic N and P concentrations were higher in the seaside creeks (OM: 9.0 and 3.4 mg l-1; chlorophyll a: 6.0 and 4.1 g l-1; PO43-: 0.2 and 1.2 muM; NH4+: 0.6 and 1.2 muM; bayside and seaside respectively). The high inorganic nutrient pools combined with the low levels of bacterial productivity suggest that bacterial production is not limited by N or P in the seaside creeks and that the amount of carbon moving through the bacterial loop is much less than on the bayside. In fact, DOC turnover times were much longer for the seaside (22 d) than for the bayside (6 d). Reasons for the observed differences in bacterial dynamics for the bay and seasides are not known specifically, but may be related to differences in the source of the DOC (marsh grass vs phytoplankton), grazing on the bacterial cells, or bacterial community structure.

AB  - Salt marshes occupy the transition zone between terrestrial and marine ecosystem and provide habitat for salt tolerant plant species-halophytes. Dominant halophytes such as Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides and Suaeda maritima play significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient mineralization, nutrient cycling and improving micro-environment. There are scanty reports on the rhizosphere microbial communities of halophytes. Whether the rhizosphere of halophytes harbors unique microbial communities or has species specificity is yet to be established. In the present study, we have determined microbial community structure and functional genes abundance as well as major nutrients and three key enzyme activities in both rhizosphere and bulk soil of three halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus and Suaeda) growing on salty marsh of coastal Gujarat, India. The NH4-N and available K were significantly higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil in all the cases. The rhizosphere of Suaeda was characterized by significantly higher concentrations of organic carbon, total N, NH4-N and available P as compared to other two halophytes. The rhizopsheric soil had significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve and total bacterial PLFA biomarkers compared to the bulk soil. Among halophytes, significantly higher concentrations of total PLFA, GM+ve, GM-ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs were recorded in Suaeda and Aeluropus in comparison to Salicornia. The NMS analysis of PLFA profiles revealed a significant difference in microbial community structure in Salicornia compared to Aeluropus and Suaeda. Similarly, rhizosphere microbial community structure of Salicornia was significantly different from Suaeda and Aeluropus. In rhizosphere soils, significantly higher abundance (molar%) of GM-ve, GM +ve, total bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs were observed in Aeluropus and Suaeda compared to Salicornia. Activities of beta-glucosidase and urease were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. The abundance of 16S rRNA, cbbL and nifH genes, detected by the quantitative RT-PCR was significantly varied among soils and halophytes. The results exhibited high bacterial diversity, abundance of CO2 and N-fixing bacteria, which can be explored further for their role in C and N cycling for sustainable agriculture and environment management.

AB  - Along the coastal areas of the Southwest Atlantic estuaries and embayments, phreatic water often circulates through very extended areas (up to several hundred meters perpendicular to the coast), dominated by dense assemblages of deep burrows of the crab Neohelice granulata (formerly Chasmagnathus granulatus). This crab inhabits the intertidal area, from mudflats to marshes vegetated by species of Spartina, Sarcocornia and Juncus, generating extensive burrowing beds where burrow density may reach LIP to 60 burrows m(-2). Since the lower limit of the crab burrows is usually the water table, we investigated through field experiments the effect of N. granulata and their burrows on the chemical characteristics of this phreatic water. Water analysis from experimental (1) occupied burrows (with crabs), (2) unoccupied burrows (where crabs were excluded), and (3) sediment pore water show remarkable differences. Water oxygenation, and nitrate, ammonium and sulphate concentrations inside occupied burrows were higher than in the water inside unoccupied burrows or pore waters. Moreover, directed sampling of phreatic water entering and leaving the crab bed, shows that dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration is enhanced as the water crosses the crab bed. These results may be ascribed to the fact that in the salt marsh the crabs spend most of their time within burrows, where presumably they store food (plants) and defecate. These activities generate an area of accumulation of excrements and nutrients in different decomposition states. The present work shows a novel way by which bioturbating organisms can affect nutrients exportation from salt marshes to the open waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The carbon burial in vegetated sediments, ignored in past assessments of carbon burial in the ocean, was evaluated using a bottom-up approach derived from upscaling a compilation of published individual estimates of carbon burial in vegetated habitats (seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangrove forests) to the global level and a top-down approach derived from considerations of global sediment balance and a compilation of the organic carbon content of vegeatated sediments. Up-scaling of individual burial estimates values yielded a total carbon burial in vegetated habitats of 111 Tmol C y(-1). The total burial in unvegetated sediments was estimated to be 126 Tg C y(-1), resulting in a bottom-up estimate of total burial in the ocean of about 244 Tg C y(-1), two-fold higher than estimates of oceanic carbon burial that presently enter global carbon budgets. The organic carbon concentrations in vegetated marine sediments exceeds by 2 to 10-fold those in shelf/deltaic sediments. Top-down recalculation of ocean sediment budgets to account for these, previously neglected, organic-rich sediments, yields a top-down carbon burial estimate of 216 Tg C y(-1), with vegetated coastal habitats contributing about 50%. Even though vegetated carbon burial contributes about half of the total carbon burial in the ocean, burial represents a small fraction of the net production of these ecosystems, estimated at about 3388 Tg C y(-1), suggesting that bulk of the benthic net ecosystem production must support excess respiration in other compartments, such as unvegetated sediments and the coastal pelagic compartment. The total excess organic carbon available to be exported to the ocean is estimated at between 1126 to 3534 Tg C y(-1), the bulk of which must be respired in the open ocean. Widespread loss of vegetated coastal habitats must have reduced carbon burial in the ocean by about 30 Tg Cy-1, identifying the destruction of these ecosystems as an important loss of CO2 sink capacity in the biosphere.

AB  - Sandy coastlines are dynamic environments with potential for biodiverse habitats, such as green beaches. Green beach vegetation can develop on nutrient-poor beaches landward from embryo dunes. It is characterised by low-dynamic coastal wetland habitat such as salt marshes and dune slacks. It has been hypothesised that the establishment of green beach vegetation is facilitated by the shelter provided by embryo dunes, however evidence is lacking.
   We explored the importance of geomorphology and soil conditions on the species richness and turnover of green beach vegetation over a time period of 10 years. We recorded 107 plots along 11 transects over a gradient from beach to dune on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands. We characterised transect geomorphology at transect level and soil conditions and vegetation at plot level in 2006 and 2016.
   We found that the green beach vegetation was highly dynamic, total plant cover increased by 62% within 10 years. In 2006 beach width was an important factor in explaining species richness, with the highest number of species occurring on narrow beaches with a large volume of embryo dunes. In 2016, species richness was positively associated with the build-up of organic matter. Overall species richness declined relative to 2006 and was accompanied by an increase in elevation due to sand burial and the expansion of embryo dune volume.
   Our data suggests that geomorphology influenced the vegetation indirectly by affecting sand burial rate. Plant species richness declined less at sheltered conditions where sand burial was limited, allowing the build-up of organic matter. This indicates a time-dependent relationship between the development of embryo dunes and plant species richness: embryo dunes can be a source of shelter, thus increasing species richness, but can compete for space over time, lowering species richness again. Our results are relevant for engineering and management of biodiverse sandy shores. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - Recently, a novel mode of sulphur oxidation was described in marine sediments, in which sulphide oxidation in deeper anoxic layers was electrically coupled to oxygen reduction at the sediment surface. Subsequent experimental evidence identified that long filamentous bacteria belonging to the family Desulfobulbaceae likely mediated the electron transport across the centimetre-scale distances. Such long-range electron transfer challenges some long-held views in microbial ecology and could have profound implications for sulphur cycling in marine sediments. But, so far, this process of electrogenic sulphur oxidation has been documented only in laboratory experiments and so its imprint on the seafloor remains unknown. Here we show that the geochemical signature of electrogenic sulphur oxidation occurs in a variety of coastal sediment environments, including a salt marsh, a seasonally hypoxic basin, and a subtidal coastal mud plain. In all cases, electrogenic sulphur oxidation was detected together with an abundance of Desulfobulbaceae filaments. Complementary laboratory experiments in intertidal sands demonstrated that mechanical disturbance by bioturbating fauna destroys the electrogenic sulphur oxidation signal. A survey of published geochemical data and 16S rRNA gene sequences identified that electrogenic sulphide oxidation is likely present in a variety of marine sediments with high sulphide generation and restricted bioturbation, such as mangrove swamps, aquaculture areas, seasonally hypoxic basins, cold sulphide seeps and possibly hydrothermal vent environments. This study shows for the first time that electrogenic sulphur oxidation occurs in a wide range of marine sediments and that bioturbation may exert a dominant control on its natural distribution.

LA  - Spanish
AB  - The Vertical and lateral variability of organic geochemical parameters was established for the Seam 4 of the Fila Maestra coal deposit (Quebradon Formation, Oligocene-Early Miocene age) through the study of coals and carbonaceous shales collected in different outcrops of the coal seam. Chemical and physical analysis included moisture and ash contents, maceral groups, vitrinite reflectance, total carbon, bitumen and its fractions, as well as characterization of saturated hydrocarbons by gas chromatography (n-alkane distributions and pristane/phytane ratios). A production sample, representative of the Seam 4, was further analyzed for S, Cl, C, H, O and its calorific value determined. The data collected allowed us to classify these samples as high-volatile bituminous coals, types B and C, according to ASTM classification.
   The results of the analysis showed little vertical or lateral variation in the properties studied. A gradual increase in ash content in the westward direction, together with a thinning of the coal seam, suggest a greater proximity of the basin border in this direction. High values in pristane/phytane ratio (4-7), predominance of heavy alkanes and high contents in vitrinites clearly indicates that primigenic organic matter was essentially continental in character. However, the bimodal n-alkane distribution, together with a high sulfur (2.7%) and chlorine (0.12%) contents suggest a marine-influenced environment. In consequence, it is proposed that these coals were formed in a transitional environment, as salt-marshs in coastal lagoons or in low deltaic plains. These results are in agreement with the stratigraphic analysis of the sedimentary unit.

AB  - Wetland sediments surrounding the San Francisco Bay Estuary contain a rich history of environmental change which can aid predictions of potential responses to future environmental change. Here we present results of a study of the stable carbon isotopic composition of modern surface sediments as they relate to the existing plant cover. The results indicate a strong correlation between the modern plant cover and the delta C-13 value of underlying surface sediments (RMS = 1.331). Reasons for residual differences between predicted and observed isotopic values of the surface soils include intraspecific changes in delta C-13 values of C3 plants, contributions to the carbon pool by algae, and effects of diagenesis on delta C-13 value of plant matter. The goal of this research is to provide a basis for interpreting isotopic data obtained from sediment cores in terms of changes in vegetation resulting from changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - The international scientific community is increasingly recognizing the role of natural systems in climate-change mitigation. While forests have historically been the primary focus of such efforts, coastal wetlands - particularly seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves - are now considered important and effective long-term carbon sinks. However, some members of the coastal and marine policy and management community have been interested in expanding climate mitigation strategies to include other components within coastal and marine systems, such as coral reefs, phytoplankton, kelp forests, and marine fauna. We analyze the scientific evidence regarding whether these marine ecosystems and ecosystem components are viable long-term carbon sinks and whether they can be managed for climate mitigation. Our findings could assist decision makers and conservation practitioners in identifying which components of coastal and marine ecosystems should be prioritized in current climate mitigation strategies and policies.

AB  - Seagrasses sequester globally significant amounts of carbon (C), which is stored mainly in the sediment. Both C fixation by the seagrass (autochthonous) and the trapping of organic matter that is derived from outside the ecosystem (allochthonous) contribute to seagrass sediment organic C (OC). However, due to limitations in current methods we do not yet fully understand which sources of C are most important to blue C ecosystems. We used environmental-DNA (eDNA) to identify and estimate the contribution of floral sources to seagrass sediment OC sampled from three sites in Moreton Bay, Australia that differ in potential levels of autochthonous and allochthonous OC inputs. Using the plant barcode gene rbcL and a next-generation sequencing platform we identified 150 plant operational taxonomic units in the sediment samples. We found that seagrass DNA composed on average 88% of the eDNA pool in the sediment samples. Allochtonous sources were primarily mangrove, salt-marsh, and freshwater marsh species, but the proportional contribution of other sources varied among meadows. Carbon and nitrogen (N) stable isotope mixing models suggested a lower autochthonous contribution than the eDNA data, but had high ambiguity due to indistinguishable isotopic values among some of the sources. Our study shows that eDNA can be an effective tool for identifying sources to sediment OC in blue C ecosystems and can be used in conjunction with stable isotope analysis to reduce ambiguity. Identifying the sources of OC to the sediments of blue C ecosystems is crucial for building robust and accurate C budgets for these systems.

AB  - DEVERRA regions characterized by strong climatic changes that affect production of bioactive natural products. In Egypt, it is widespread on the North-Western Coast and Western and Eastern deserts. It is used in folk medicine and as fuelwood by local inhabitants. in the present study, qualitative and quantitative tests were performed to investigate the main chemical constituents (primary and secondary metabolites) of D. tortuosa collected from 17 locations representing seven different habitats. The study also aims to clarify the effect of several environmental conditions on the main biochemical components of the plant. in the present study, D. tortuosa grew in adverse environments, particularly in sununer, which improved the production and accumulation of some antioxidant compounds, including tannins, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, phenols, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. D. tortuosa produced a high content of total carbohydrates (32.18% in salt marshes, which recorded the highest EC,0.54mS/cm), crude protein (19.88% in sand flats), total alkaloids (111.5mg/g on roadsides, which also recorded the lowest content of organic carbon, 0.16%), total tannins and flavonoids (17.76 and 73.56mg/g, respectively in fig fields, which were characterized by high soil pH, 7.8). Therefore, D. tortuosa shrubs preferred an arid environment and can be considered a new source of several different metabolites that can contribute to drug improvement. In addition, the study provides insight into unusual strategies to increase the efficiency of wild plants for accumulation of phytochemicals.

AB  - Freshwater peatlands are carbon accumulating ecosystems where primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition rates in the soil, and therefore perform an important sink function in global carbon cycling. Typical peatland plant and microbial communities are adapted to the waterlogged, often acidic and low nutrient conditions that characterise them. Peatlands in coastal locations receive inputs of oceanic base cations that shift conditions from the environmental optimum of these communities altering the carbon balance. Blanket bogs are one such type of peatlands occurring in hyperoceanic regions. Using a blanket bog to coastal marsh transect in Northwest Scotland we assess the impacts of salt intrusion on carbon accumulation rates. A threshold concentration of salt input, caused by inundation, exists corresponding to rapid acidophilic to halophilic plant community change and a carbon accumulation decline. For the first time, we map areas of blanket bog vulnerable to sea-level rise, estimating that this equates to similar to 7.4% of the total extent and a 0.22 Tg yr(-1) carbon sink. Globally, tropical peatlands face the proportionally greatest risk with similar to 61,000 km(2) (similar to 16.6% of total) lying <= 5 m elevation. In total an estimated 20.2 +/- 2.5 GtC is stored in peatlands <= 5 m above sea level, which are potentially vulnerable to inundation.

AB  - Vertical profiles of C, N, delta N-15 and Pb were measured in the Mondego and Mira estuaries as markers that conveyed notions as to the relative influence of anthropogenic influence over the past decades. Recent carbon changes in both estuaries may reflect changes in estuarine productivity, probably as a consequence of sediment reworking and erosion, and also of losses in salt marsh area and dwarf eelgrass beds. delta N-15 values began to diverge considerably before the %C and %N and were higher in Mondego. delta N-15 signatures detected N enrichment at relatively low rates, and indicated that Mondego received more enriched N than Mira. Lead concentrations differed between estuaries, with higher concentrations in Mondego. The secular increase in %N, Pb, and delta N-15 signatures was significantly related to human density in the watersheds of the estuaries and were sensitive indicators of anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Pyrite as a proxy for the redox states of bottom waters was evaluated in the context of modern salt marsh sediments. Two sites, 40 m apart, with very different physicochemical properties were sampled seasonally. The sites differed from each other in (1) the amount of tidal flushing, (2) vegetation, (3) redox condition below the sediment-water interface, (4) carbon content and (5) solid phase iron oxyhydroxide and iron sulfide content of the sediment. The calculated degree of pyritization (DOP) varies between 0.44 and 1.0, depending on the site and the season. Different DOP values were obtained for the same samples when different techniques were applied for extraction of reactive iron. Framboidal pyrite was dominant; however, other textural forms of pyrite were also observed. The size distribution of the individual pyrite crystals and the framboids was fairly narrow; with the majority of them having diameters < 10 mum. Despite deposition taking place in aerobic waters (fully oxygenated waters) at the sampled sites, both the DOP and pyrite textures indicated dysoxic (waters with low oxygen concentrations) to euxinic (waters with no oxygen present, and H2S may be continually or intermittently present) bottom waters. These results indicate that caution must be applied when using DOP and pyrite morphologies as proxies for interpreting the redox conditions of different depositional environments.

AB  - The increasing concentrations of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere stress the importance of monitoring and quantifying the fluxes from coastal environments. In nine sampling campaigns between 2013 and 2014, we measured the spatial CH4 concentrations, identified major sources and calculated the fluxes at the air-water interface in an eutrophic tropical embayment, Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The bay presented high spatial variability of CH4 concentrations, without a significant trend with salinity, but observed the influence of the urban areas at its watershed. Although the more polluted sector of the bay accounts for about 10% of the sampled surface area, it contributed to one half of the bay's total CH4 emissions. In most cases, high CH4 concentrations seemed be sustained by allochtonous sources such as the sewage network and polluted rivers, especially under high accumulated precipitation conditions. In the most stratified area, at the inner and centre of the Bay, CH4 concentrations were not significantly higher in bottom hypoxic waters than in surface waters, suggesting that CH4 diffusion from these sediments was modest, due to the prevalence of sulphate reduction over methanogenesis. Our calculated annual air-sea fluxes (565-980 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)) are well above those of most estuaries worldwide, showing that urban pollution can be an important source of CH4 to the coastal waters and even more significant than the presence of organic-rich environments, like salt marshes and mangroves. Comparing the greenhouse gas emissions in terms of CO2-equivalent, CH4 emissions reduced the net CO2 sink in Guanabara Bay by 16%.

AB  - Seven sediment cores (60-80 cm) were collected at Chiricahueto marsh, a salt marsh influenced by agrochemical, domestic and industrial effluents. The concentrations of Ag, Al, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Pb, V and Zn were studied in the solid phase at each 1-cm section. The profiles of Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn showed a slight recent pollution in the site with enrichment and anthropogenic factors higher than unity; and correlation analysis indicated a direct association with organic carbon. Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Li, and V concentration profiles displayed a negative correlation with organic C and positive with mud content and no consistent enrichment at surface. Based on the principal component analysis and correlation analysis, two principal groups of metals were identified. The first group includes Al, Co, Cr, Fe and Li, that are derived predominantly from the weathering of parent materials in the local bedrock; and the second group include most of the metals, which were relatively enriched at surficial sediments, that are produced mainly by anthropogenic activities such as agriculture (Cd, Cu and Zn), sewage effluents (Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) and in lesser extent atmospheric deposition (Cd and Pb).

AB  - Patterns and controls of carbon trace gas emissions from wetlands may vary depending upon the spatial and temporal scale being examined. The factors affecting these emissions are thought to be hierarchically related according to their respective scales of importance. A hierarchical model of processes controlling methane emissions from wetlands is presented and examined here. During the 1990 Northern Wetlands Study (NOWES) methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) fluxes were measured in static chambers along a 100 km transect in the Hudson Bay lowland (HBL). Environmental variables, vegetation abundance, and ecosystem age and structure were also quantified at each sampling site. The findings indicate that CH4 emissions from peatlands (e.g., bogs and fens) and other wetlands (e.g., salt marshes) in the region were low, and were nil or negative (i.e., CH4 uptake) in forests and bog forests dominated by aspen and black spruce. Site to site variations in mean CH4 flux appeared to be most closely related to mean water table and sedge productivity, both of which are intercorrelated. Seasonal changes in CH4 flux tend to follow soil temperature fluctuations. Instantaneous CO2 and CH4 daytime fluxes exhibit a negative correlation, suggesting that photosynthetic assimilation of carbon may be related to CH4 emissions, although the processes of CO2 and CH4 production are occurring at somewhat different temporal scales. No diurnal variations in CH4 flux could be detected. While soil water pH trends rue not fully explored, there is some indication that high CH4 fluxes are concentrated around pH 4 and pH 7. Soil temperature closely follows the seasonal progression of CH4 flux. Estimated CH4 seasonal flux (1.5-3.9 g CH4 m(-2) season(-1)) and estimated aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) (90 - 400 g dry weight m(-2) season(-1)) show systematic changes along a successional sequence which are consistent with patterns predicted from successional theory. Estimated seasonal NMHC emissions (0.5-1.4 g C m(-2) season(-1)) exhibit an increase along the succession from salt marsh to Sphagnum bog communities. Data from several studies were combined to estimate seasonal CO2 flux from three sites. The estimated fluxes range from a net uptake of 23 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1) to a net loss of 77 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1), although there are large uncertainties in these estimates. It is inferred from the assessment of ecosystem age and structure that disturbance effects and successional changes occurring over hundreds to thousands of years in the HBL strongly control regional CH4, CO2, and NMHC emissions by influencing NPP, species composition, community structure, soil (peat) development, and landscape hydrology. Given this, it is likely that models of carbon trace gas flux based on succession models may be useful in predicting climate change-landscape change feedbacks.

AB  - In Canada and elsewhere in North America, impoundments are created in compensation for historic wetland loss and for habitat loss due to development projects, but these new sites are infrequently evaluated to determine how effectively they function. The Cumberland Marsh Region (CMR), located at the head of the Bay of Fundy, Canada, is of importance to migratory birds and has been subject to 300+ years of anthropogenic alteration, including impoundment creation on diked and drained tidal marsh in the last five decades. Wetland managers have noticed a pervasive decline in impoundment productivity leading to reduced waterbird usage (senescence). To understand factors that promote senescence, we analyzed abiotic and biotic proxies in sediment archives from six freshwater impoundments in two coastal watersheds to assess spatial trends across the CMR within recent decades. Our results demonstrate that impoundment productivity is driven by autochthonous nutrient sources (C/N between 7.7 and 14.4), but biogeochemical conditions can be highly variable among impoundments despite their proximity. Biogeochemical variation among top-of-core sediment samples from each impoundment was generally minimal, and thus we believe that the aging of impoundments has resulted in low productivity and organic matter accumulation due to dike stabilization and declines in nutrient loading. We conclude that these freshwater impoundments (in the CMR and likely other similar settings) are not highly productive, and may not provide abundant forage and optimal wildlife habitat which is expected of these systems; adaptive management strategies and hydrologic rehabilitation merit consideration to enhance ecological functioning. Understanding landscape attributes, hydrologic dynamics, and conditions prior to and after major human alterations should be a priority in future compensation projects.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in regional and even continental sustainable development because of their valuable ecosystem services. The coupling mechanism among hydrology, edaphic factors, and vegetation is the key to coastal wetland management. The current study conducted in the Yellow River Delta used an improved-comprehensive hydrological connectivity structure index, Topographic Over Field Capacity Index (TOFCI), based on both soil water conditions (SWC) and topography to highlight the role of hydrological connectivity on intertidal flat (IF), tidal marsh (TM), semi-artificial pond (AP) and riverside intermittent flooded (RS) wetland classes among other environmental variables. The results showed plant community distributions and structures among wetland classes differed from each other significantly, and hydrological connectivity structure is one of the driving factors. The results provided three pieces of evidence for this inference: 1) according to PCA results, the contribution of TOFCI is the highest among all environmental variables; 2) TOFCI values show significant difference among different plant communities; 3) TOFCI is also significantly correlated to species composition and distribution according to the CCA and RDA results. TOFCI values are positively linearly correlated to the plant coverage and biomass in intertidal flat wetlands according to linear regression analysis. Furthermore, salinity, soil total nitrogen and soil total phosphorus also influence plant community distribution and species composition. Finally, simple parameters for soil water conditions or topographic characteristics do not show significant explanatory power to hydrology-vegetation interaction. The results of the current study provide a new perspective for coastal wetland conservation and restoration.

AB  - In a tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) in lower Chesapeake Bay, salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) recently has become established where TFM vegetation previously grew. To determine the potential contribution of saltwater intrusion to the observed species transition, we conducted a mesocosm study subjecting Spartina and two TFM perennials (Peltandra virginica and Leersia oryzoides) to sub-lethal levels of salinity (0, 2, 4 and 6). We measured plant performance as carbon dioxide flux over the leaf stomata as a proxy for net photosynthesis (Anet), aboveground and belowground biomass and tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. For Spartina, all metrics were unchanged across the range of tested salinity. The TFM species, however, had lower Anet than Spartina and decreased with added salinity. TFM biomass was reduced up to 86 % in both the aboveground and belowground compartments, and aboveground nutrient allocation was altered: N increased in Leersia and P increased in Peltandra with increasing salinity. Under this simulation of increased salt intrusion associated with climate change and sea level rise, TFM species responded with decreased biomass and decreased tissue C:N. Although other factors must contribute, the abiotic salt stressor leads to plant responses consistent with the observed replacement of TFM species by Spartina.

AB  - Barataria Basin, a deltaic marsh-estuary system in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), is an important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the coastal ecosystem. To assess DOM dynamics, monthly measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and colored DOM (CDOM; an optical proxy for DOC) absorption were obtained over a three-year period (2008-2011) along a transect encompassing the upper, middle and lower regions of the Barataria Basin estuary. While CDOM absorption coefficient at 355 nm (a(g)355) generally decreased and spectral slope at 275-295 nm (S275-295) increased along the transect from the upper to lower basin, deviations were observed associated with hydrologic and meteorological influences. An application of wavelet analysis to the time-series of a(g)355 and various freshwater sources revealed a spatiotemporal resonance of ag355 with freshwater input from the Mississippi River (MR), the controlled freshwater discharge from the Davis Pond freshwater diversion, and rainfall in the lower, middle and upper basins, respectively. Field measurements and Landsat/MODIS data spanning across different seasons between 2008 and 2011 were used to develop optimized a(g)355 empirical algorithms for the high river flow, cold front, and normal conditions. Power law models relating a band ratio (green/red) of a satellite sensor to a(g)355 showed good performance for the MODIS-Aqua (R-2 similar to 0.81-0.83, N = 581) and Landsat-5 TM (R-2 similar to 0.72-0.79, N = 304) imagery. a(g)355-DOC relationships (R-2 similar to 0.77-0.84, N = 306) applied to historical Landsat-5 TM (1985-2011) and MODIS-Aqua imagery (2002-2012) showed strong environmental influences on multi-decadal CDOM and DOC spatiotemporal trends. Satellite-derived DOC agreed reasonably well with in-situ measured DOC (averaged R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 2.13). While the time-series DOC showed seasonality and decreasing gradients from the upper to lower basin, an overall increase in DOC was observed in the upper and middle basins from 1985 to 2012. However, in the lower basin, DOC increased from 1985 to 2006 but decreased from 2007 to 2012, likely due to the impact of two major hurricanes in 2005. Furthermore, relationships between satellite-derived DOC and land cover variations (1985-2011) along the wetland-estuary interfaces derived from Landsat-5 TM supervised classification showed an increase in DOC with corresponding increase in developed area in the upper basin, while in the lower basin, DOC increased by 41% (R-2 = 0.54) between 1985 and 2006 corresponding to a 17% decrease in salt marsh area, suggesting strong land use/land loss impact on the long-term DOC trends in Barataria Basin.

AB  - Oregon estuaries provide important opportunities to assess controls on tidal saline wetland carbon burial and sediment accretion as both rates of relative sea level rise (RSLR; -1.4 0.9 to 2.8 0.8 mm yr(-1)) and fluvial suspended sediment load relative to estuary area (0.23 to 17 x 10(3) t km(-2) yr(-1)) vary along the coast. We hypothesized that vertical accretion, measured using excess Pb-210 in least-disturbed wetlands within seven Oregon estuaries, would vary with either RSLR or sediment load relative to estuary area, and carbon burial would correlate strongly to sediment accretion. Mean rates of high marsh accretion (0.8 0.2 to 4.1 0.2 mm yr(-1)) indicate that Oregon tidal wetlands have mainly kept pace with twentieth-century RSLR with the exception that the accretionary balance in the central coast is negative, suggesting drowning. Experiencing the fastest rates of RSLR, central-coast estuaries may foreshadow the fates of other Oregon estuaries under future accelerated sea level rise. Comparison of mass accumulation rates with sediment loads, however, indicates low trapping efficiency and therefore no fluvial sediment limitation. Thus, nonlinear feedback between RSLR and sediment accretion may enhance wetland resistance to drowning. Among wetlands keeping pace with or exceeding RSLR, sediment accretion displays no significant relationship with elevation but rather appears controlled by both the rate of RSLR and relative sediment load, highlighting the importance of incorporating both factors into future studies of tidal saline wetlands. Carbon burial rates, controlled by sediment accretion, will likely increase with future accelerated sea level rise.
   Plain Language Summary Salt marshes and brackish scrub-shrub and forested tidal wetlands, collectively known as tidal saline wetlands, provide valuable services such as habitat for wildlife, protection from coastal flooding, and carbon sequestration. Despite their importance, tidal saline wetlands are threatened by sea level rise and scientists must better understand what controls their growth so as to make predictions of their future survival. Additionally, sediment accumulation within tidal saline wetlands is an important control on the amount of carbon sequestered in coastal areas; thus, understanding how these systems will evolve in the coming decades may shed light on the global carbon cycle and climate change. New results from the Oregon coast indicate that both the local pace of sea level rise and the amount of sediment delivered by rivers control tidal saline wetland growth. Because sea level rise is relatively slow in Oregon and Pacific Northwest rivers deliver relatively high amounts of sediment to the coast, Oregon tidal saline wetlands may be resistant to future drowning. However, of the seven estuaries studied, two showed evidence of drowning over the last century; the reasons for this are unclear but may relate to the local pace of sea level rise or other processes not accounted for in this study.
   Key Points
   Oregon tidal saline wetlands kept pace with twentieth-century sea level rise, except in the central coast, the reasons for which are unclear In estuaries with a positive accretionary balance, both sea level rise and sediment load relative to estuary area control accretion Blue carbon burial rates, provided herein, are the first such measurements for Oregon tidal saline wetlands

AB  - Resource limitation controls the base of food webs in many aquatic ecosystems. In coastal ecosystems, nitrogen (N) has been found to be the predominant limiting factor for primary producers. Due to the important role nitrogen plays in determining ecosystem function, understanding the processes that modulate its availability is critical. Shallow-water estuarine systems are highly heterogeneous. In temperate estuaries, multiple habitat types can exist in close proximity to one another, their distribution controlled primarily by physical energy, tidal elevation and geomorphology. Distinctions between these habitats such as rates of primary productivity and sediment characteristics likely affect material processing. We used membrane inlet mass spectrometry to measure changes in N-2 flux (referred to here as denitrification) in multiple shallow-water estuarine habitats through an annual cycle. We found significantly higher rates of denitrification (DNF) in structured habitats such as submerged aquatic vegetation, salt marshes and oyster reefs than in intertidal and subtidal flats. Seasonal patterns were also observed, with higher DNF rates occurring in the warmer seasons. Additionally, there was an interaction between habitat type and season that we attributed to the seasonal patterns of enhanced productivity in individual habitat types. There was a strong correlation between denitrification and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in all habitats and all seasons, suggesting the potential to utilize SOD to predict DNF. Denitrification efficiency was also higher in the structured habitats than in the flats. Nitrogen removal by these habitats was found to be an important contributor to estuarine ecosystem function. The ecosystem service of DNF in each habitat was evaluated in US dollars using rates from a regional nutrient-offset market to determine the cost to replace N through management efforts. Habitat-specific values of N removal ranged from approximately three thousand U.S. dollars per acre per year in the submerged aquatic vegetation to approximately four hundred U.S. dollars per acre per year in the subtidal flat. Because of the link between habitat type and processes such as DNF, changes in habitat area and distribution will have consequences for both ecosystem function and the delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - World is suffering from severe energy crisis and require an efficient renewable energy source. To meet global energy demands, the conservation of renewable energy sources is inevitable. Significant renewable energy can be produced from organic matter that is otherwise considered waste in the form of clean bioelectricity. A less mediator plant microbial fuel cell designed for comparative analysis, power density of two different electrodes; Nickel and Graphite and tested using different local salt marsh grass species Sporobolasarabicus and Cynodondactylon. Both electrodes generated the power density of 23 mW/m(2) and 10.7 mW/m(2) respectively withoutusing feed solution. In other experiments using feed solution, the power output was also recorded during the period of two months. The maximum power density recorded as 120 mW/m(2) and 58mW/m(2) respectively from S. arabicus and C. dactylonspecies. Electrodes coupling with same or different electrode materials checked and current voltage relationship with power recorded before and after the application of plant nutrient solution from 1-8th weeks. Maximum current voltage relationship with power measured around 4-6th week for different electrodes and plant species. Graphite proved best electrode material as compared to Nickel for production of electricity. Two conditions existed in the single chamber configuration, one in which cathode was placed inside the soil near roots to consume oxygen and other was to improve power enhancement using plant nutrient solutions. Ohmic resistance and mass transfer losses could be decreased using membrane-less configuration that in fact makes it cost effective because membrane is the primary cost of plant microbial fuel cell. The main reason for not using membraneis that the concentration of oxygen decreases very much in the depth of water or sediment which reduces the need for a membrane. Moreover, the soil or sediment might filter oxygen, acts as PEM and the redox potential of soil also decreases.

AB  - Contemporary deposition (artificial marker horizon, 3.5 years) and long-term accumulation rates (Pb-210 profiles, similar to 150 years) of sediment and associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were measured in wetlands along the tidal Savannah and Waccamaw rivers in the southeastern USA. Four sites along each river spanned an upstream-to-downstream salinification gradient, from upriver tidal freshwater forested wetland (TFFW), through moderately and highly salt-impacted forested wetlands, to oligohaline marsh downriver. Contemporary deposition rates (sediment, C, N, and P) were greatest in oligohaline marsh and lowest in TFFW along both rivers. Greater rates of deposition in oligohaline and salt-stressed forested wetlands were associated with a shift to greater clay and metal content that is likely associated with a change from low availability of watershed-derived sediment to TFFW and to greater availability of a coastal sediment source to oligohaline wetlands. Long-term accumulation rates along the Waccamaw River had the opposite spatial pattern compared to contemporary deposition, with greater rates in TFFW that declined to oligohaline marsh. Long-term sediment and elemental mass accumulation rates also were 3-9x lower than contemporary deposition rates. In comparison to other studies, sediment and associated nutrient accumulation in TFFW are lower than downriver/estuarine freshwater, oligohaline, and salt marshes, suggesting a reduced capacity for surface sedimentation (short-term) as well as shallow soil processes (long-term sedimentation) to offset sea level rise in TFFW. Nonetheless, their potentially large spatial extent suggests that TFFW have a large impact on the transport and fate of sediment and nutrients in tidal rivers and estuaries.

AB  - Iron reduction in marine sulfitic environments may occur via a mechanism involving direct bacterial reduction with the use of hydrogen as an electron donor, direct bacterial reduction involving carbon turnover, or by indirect reduction where sulfide acts to reduce iron. In the presented experiments, the relative importance of direct and indirect mechanisms of iron reduction, and the contribution of these two mechanisms to overall carbon turnover has been evaluated in two marsh environments. Sediments collected from two Northeastern US salt marshes each having different Fe (III) histories were incubated with the addition of reactive iron (as amorphous oxyhydroxide). These sediments were either incubated alone or in conjunction with sodium molybdate. Production of both inorganic and organic pore water constituents and a calculation of net carbon production were used as measures to compare the relative importance of direct bacterial reduction and indirect bacterial reduction. Results indicate that in the environments tested, the majority of the reduced iron found results from indirect reduction mediated by hydrogen sulfide, a result of dissolution and precipitation phenomena, or is a result of direct bacterial reduction using hydrogen as an electron donor. Direct iron reduction plays a minor role in carbon turnover in these environments.

AB  - The relationships between the bioaccumulation of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, Cd, and Pb, acidity (pH), salinity (Ec), and organic matter content within trophic levels (water-soil-plants-invertebrates) were studied in saline environments in Poland. Environments included sodium manufactures, wastes utilization areas, dumping grounds, and agriculture cultivation, where disturbed Ca, Mg, and Fe exist and the impact of Cd and Pb is high. We found Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, and Cd accumulation in the leaves of plants and in invertebrates. Our aim was to determine the selectivity exhibited by soil for nutrients and heavy metals and to estimate whether it is important in elucidating how these metals are available for plant/animal uptake in addition to their mobility and stability within soils. We examined four ecological plant groups: trees, shrubs, minor green plants, and water macrophytes. Among invertebrates, we sampled breastplates Malacostraca, small arachnids Arachnida, diplopods Diplopoda, small insects Insecta, and snails Gastropoda. A higher level of chemical elements was found in saline polluted areas (sodium manufactures and anthropogenic sites). Soil acidity and salinity determined the bioaccumulation of free radicals in the trophic levels measured. A pH decrease caused Zn and Cd to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Ca, Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb in the anthropogenic sites. pH increase also caused Na, Mg, and Fe to increase in sodium manufactures and an increase in Na, Fe, Mn, and Co in the anthropogenic sites. There was a significant correlation between these chemical elements and Ec in soils. We found significant relationships between pH and Ec, which were positive in saline areas of sodium manufactures and negative in the anthropogenic and control sites. These dependencies testify that the measurement of the selectivity of cations and their fluctuation in soils provide essential information on the affinity and binding strength in these environments. The chemical elements accumulated in soils and plants; however, further flow is selective and variable. The selectivity exhibited by soil systems for nutrients and heavy metals is important in elucidating how these metals become available for plant/animal uptake and also their mobility and stability in soils.

AB  - The effects of time on the evolution of land use intensity and soil nutrients distribution were studied in a reclamation zone of the Yangtze Estuary. Land use types were grouped into five intensity levels according to the extent of human disturbance. We used the "space for time substitution" method to test the impact of time on changes in land use intensity after reclamation and found that land use levels increased quickly within the first 35 years, then slowed. Soil salinity was relatively higher in aquaculture ponds than that in areas with other types of land cover due to the use of saline water from underground and the sea. Soil organic matter, available phosphorous and nitrate nitrogen were relatively high in agricultural fields, while nitrate nitrogen was highly variable in agricultural fields. The variations of all four soil properties in the built-up zone were much higher than those in the other land use groups. The spatial distribution of different nutrients is the combined effect of time and land use post reclamation. The results will provide a sound basis for future land use planning of newly reclaimed land, and for further studies on ecological consequences of salt marsh reclamation.

AB  - The food web structure within and adjacent to two permanently open estuaries with contrasting flow regimes along the south-eastern coast of South Africa was investigated employing stable isotope analysis. The Kariega Estuary is considered a freshwater-deprived system, while the Great Fish Estuary is freshwater-dominated due to an interbasin transfer scheme. Results from a study undertaken in April 2005 indicate that in the Kariega Estuary carbon sources assimilated by the zooplankton are derived from riparian vegetation in the upper reaches and from salt marsh and submerged macrophytes in the lower reaches of the system. In contrast, within the freshwater-dominated Great Fish Estuary the zooplankton appear to be sustained largely by allochthonous phytoplankton derived from freshwater inflow due to the interbasin transfer scheme. The magnitude of outflow of fresh water appears to play an important role as a carbon source for copepods and filter feeders in the marine environment adjacent to the Great Fish Estuary. The export of estuarine-derived particulate organic matter (POM) was evident up to 12 km downstream (west) of the Great Fish Estuary. Conversely, estuarine-derived POM appears to be utilised only directly adjacent to the Kariega Estuary mouth.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are important carbon pools around the world, and soil respiration is a key process that releases carbon into the atmosphere. In this study, the soil respiration rates of different wetland vegetation zones (Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, Scirpus mariqueter, and a bare mudflat) were investigated in Hangzhou Bay over 12 consecutive months. The wetland soil respiration rate was high in the daytime and low in the nighttime in summer, similar to the diurnal dynamics of soil temperature, and formed an obvious unimodal curve. The seasonal dynamics of soil respiration also formed a unimodal curve: summer > autumn > spring > winter; the soil respiration rates of the vegetation zones were in the rank of P. australis > S. alterniflora > S. mariqueter > bare mudflat, under all diurnal and seasonal conditions. The soil respiration rate had no significant correlation with soil water content but did have a significant exponential correlation with air and soil temperatures. The correlation between the soil temperature and respiration rate in P. australis, S. alterniflora, and bare mudflat was greater than that between the air temperature and respiration rate, while thatin S. mariqueter was quite different. Calculations showed that the Q(10) value, a temperature-sensitive coefficient of soil respiration, was 2.59 +/- 0.58 in the study area, and was greater in bare mudflat than in soil with vegetation. Soil CO2 emissions in P. australis, S. alterniflora, S. mariqueter, and bare mudflat were 6483.40, 5228.96, 2295.48, and 975.48 gm(-2) yr(-1) respectively.

AB  - Salt marsh formation can be initiated by the colonization of bare tidal flats by pioneer halophytes such as Spartina anglica. In the present study, growth of S. anglica in the edge and centre zones of pioneer patches colonizing a tidal flat in a marine bay in the south-west Netherlands was investigated. Average biomass and shoot length was significantly lower in centre zones than in edge zones of the patches. Multiple linear regression showed that 84% of the variance in aboveground biomass in the centre zones could be explained by sediment phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. No such relationship existed in the edge zone. This suggests that biomass production in the centre zones of the patches is nutrient limited, but that factors other than sediment nitrogen and phosphorus content determine growth of Spartina in the edge zones.
   The sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the centre zones of the patches were significantly related with sediment carbon concentrations, indicating that the pool of particle-bound nutrients in the sediment to an important extent is associated with organic particles. Determination of stable carbon isotope signatures of the sedimentary organic matter showed that an increasing carbon content of the sediment in the centre zone of the patches land a rise in plant biomass) coincides with a higher contribution of non-Spartina derived carbon to the sedimentary organic matter pool. Sustained biomass production in the centre zones of the patches, thus, probably depends on deposition of allochthonous organic particles and the nutrient inputs inherent in this process. Due to the construction of large-scale hydro-engineering works, however, conditions for deposition of waterborne particles are currently unfavourable. The consequences of reduced carbon and nutrient inputs into the patches will be particularly in the (older) centre zones, where the nutrient pools in non-refractory organic matter have been drained in the years of previous growth. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that the canopy-enhanced sedimentation for which Spartina is well-known, via positive feed-back effects on plant growth can be crucial for plant vitality, and, hence, for successful colonization of unvegetated areas.

AB  - This paper outlines potential opportunities for Africa's Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) development driven by blue economy from key strategic sectors including: Coastal and Marine Tourism; Climate Resilience; Environment; Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure. The sectoral approach is key to economic development in Africa with potential for income generation, employment creation and poverty reduction, as well as creating blue and green carbon sinks to address climate change problem and environmental management in African LMEs. The sectors establish linkages to countries' established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change making it possible to promote Integrated Approach at national, regional and continental sustainable development in Africa. The approach is complemented by the utilizing desk-top literature review and secondary data source on LMEs in Africa for blue economy. This approach is supplemented with professional experts' views and opinions, and additional data gathered from field visits to 13 African countries in August 2019 and Nairobi, Kenya Africa Blue Economy Strategy Consultative Workshop in October 2019. The Blue Economy approach development in Africa will benefit both inland and coastal countries. It is recommended that a strong development of the continental tourism will boost the demand for tourism services and infrastructures. The development of eco-tourism will contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and reduce the ecological footprint. Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services offer an opportunity to develop coastal wetland projects to mitigating climate change. Coastal protection, biomass production and water purification are among the most important ecosystem services delivered by African LMEs. Their current value is estimated to the average monetary value of carbon sequestration of about USD 130,000 per km(2) of mangrove, salt marshes and sea grasses.

AB  - Staten Island is located in one of the most densely populated regions of the US: the NewYork/NewJersey Estuary. Marine and industrial oil spills are commonplace in the area, causing the waterways and adjacent marshes to become polluted with a range of petroleum-related contaminants. Using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, the hydrocarbon impact on a saltmarsh was assessed at regular intervals down to 90 cm, with several key sampling depths of interest identified for further analysis. Ultrahigh resolution data are obtained by direct infusion (DI) atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) on a 12 T solariX Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FTICR MS) allowing trends in the compositional profile with depth to be observed, such as changes in the relative hydrocarbon intensity and the relative contributions from oxygen- and sulfur-containing groups. These trends may correlate with the timing of major oil spills and leaks of petroleum and other industrial chemicals into the water-ways. The use of gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a 7 T solariX 2XR FTICR MS equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion source offers retention time resolved and extensive compositional information for the complex environmental samples complementary to that obtained by DI-APPI. The compositional profile observed using GC-APCI FTICR MS includes contributions from phosphorous-containing groups, which may be indicative of contamination from other anthropogenic sources.

AB  - Coastal saltmarshes provide a range of ecosystem services, such as flood protection and carbon sequestration, but face rapid global losses. Managed realignment (MR) is an increasingly popular method to artificially recreate these habitats by reinstating tidal regimes to reclaimed land. However, to improve MR design, better knowledge of the processes that control morphological evolution in natural saltmarshes is needed. In this paper, we develop tools to assist in the monitoring of creek network evolution towards dynamic morphological equilibrium, a state of landform stability under current physical forcings. Using lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) datasets, we combined a semi-automated creek extraction algorithm, based on elevation and slope thresholds, with a novel algorithm for morphometric creek analysis. A comprehensive suite of morphological creek characteristics was extracted for 13 natural British saltmarshes, including: amplitude, length, sinuosity ratio, junction angle, width, depth, cross-sectional area, creek order, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, and drainage efficiency. Results closely matched with field-validated manual digitization results, and were significantly faster and less subjective to produce. Morphological equilibrium relationships from the literature were found to be applicable to the new dataset, despite yielding high prediction errors due to the inherent variety of creek network shapes in salt marshes. New equilibrium relationships were also defined relating the creek network drainage efficiency to the mouth cross-sectional area and the marsh elevation. To improve future scheme designs, these tools will be used in further studies to monitor rates of evolution towards equilibrium in MR sites depending on their initial conditions.

AB  - Disturbances are one of the most important processes affecting natural systems, but there is a gap between simple conceptual models of disturbance and complex empirical studies. We studied the perturbation caused by headward-eroding creeks in southeastern USA salt marshes. We measured disturbance responses (magnitude and recovery trajectory) of 19 variables. Some variables (shoot density, root biomass, snail density, soil pH, soil strength, soil temperature, elevation) declined sharply, while other variables (crab burrow density, soil organic matter, soil redox) increased sharply, in response to the burrowed and grazed conditions at the creek head. These variables recovered over subsequent years or decades. Other variables (shoot height, aboveground biomass, rhizome biomass, light interception) declined sharply in the creek head, then overshot control values before recovering. Some variables (benthic algae, soil salinity) did not appear to be disturbed by the creek head. As hypothesized, plants recovered before soils and snails. Disturbance magnitude and time to recovery were often greater directly adjacent to the new creekbank than for the same variables in a parallel transect further away from the creekbank, and in some cases variables never converged with control values, indicating a persistent state change. Reducing the dimensionality of the data set into principal component axes obscured the diverse ways in which different aspects of the system responded to and recovered from the perturbation. Our study illustrates the challenges in moving from simple conceptual models of disturbance to empirical studies in which multiple variables are likely to be affected differently and follow different recovery trajectories.

AB  - iron-sulfide formation in estuarine environments is controlled by sulfur availability, which is distinct in each subenvironment. Along the mesotidal, mixed-energy Huelva coast, s.w. Spain, appreciable quantites of iron sulfide appear in all the estuarine sediments. Formation of iron sulfides in the Odiel River estuary is produced under different crystallization habits in the various subenvironments. There are: (1) octahedral bipyramidal crystals, (2) concentrated crystals in the tests of foraminifers, and (3) framboidal aggregates. Sediments display higher organic carbon/sulfur ratios in the subtidal channel subenvironment than in the intertidal channel-margin sectors. This is because the channel is always submerged under water, thereby producing the sulfur available for bacterial activity. In contrast, the channel-margin sectors are only periodically submerged. Sediments of the salt marsh sectors show C/S ratio values near to those observed in fresh-water environments, since the organic carbon content is highest with only minor sulfur content because the flood water enters it only periodically. The sterile marsh sectors show a higher C/S ratio than those from the marine environments because they are reached only by astronomic tides, occurring every 60 or 183 days. The water introduced there remains for a sufficient time to allow for the sulfur to be completely comsumed. All these differences found in each estuarine subenvironment are clearly recorded in the direct correlations with distinct slopes corresponding to different C/S ratios.

AB  - Interest and investment in constructing living shorelines rather than harder engineering structures are on the rise worldwide. However, the performance of these interventions in rejuvenating coastal habitats, depositing fine sediments with elevated organic content, and reducing erosion varies widely and is often low along energetic shorelines. In this study, we test the efficacy of a living shoreline design that couples breakwalls and oyster restoration structures, in protecting coastal estuarine ecosystems and their services along energetic shorelines. A field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 along a section of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in northeast Florida, which experiences commercial and recreational vessel traffic. We discovered that organic matter, silt and clay content all increased in sediments collected in the living shorelines compared to paired control treatments. In addition, oysters established and developed into robust reefs on the gabions - wire cages filled with seasoned oyster shells - that were used to facilitate oyster recovery within this living shorelines design, although oyster growth was highest where the gabions were placed at lower intertidal elevations. Additionally, salt marsh cordgrass along shoreline margins protected by the living shoreline structures remained stable or began advancing toward the Intracoastal Waterway channel at rates of similar to 1 m per year, whereas cordgrass in control treatments retreated at rates approaching 2 m per year. This study provides powerful evidence that vessel wake stress is indeed driving ecosystem loss and that simple nature-based living shoreline structures designed to dissipate this energy can slow or reverse ecosystem decline. More research is needed to optimize these nature-based solutions for shoreline protection in coastal and estuarine settings, and to improve their durability.

AB  - In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel created an inlet over 500 m wide and 10 m deep that connected the Atlantic Ocean and Pamlico Sound. This breach was subsequently filled with sediments dredged from the adjacent sound. The purpose of this study was to determine if the barrier island terrestrial plant communities were naturally re-establishing through primary succession. In 2006-2008, we compared plant communities, soil carbon and nitrogen, and Aeolian transport of sediments in undisturbed back-dunes, undisturbed shrub thickets, putative back-dunes, and putative shrub thickets. We found that species richness and evenness were low on the filled area relative to adjacent plant communities that had persisted through the storm. Plants on the filled area were almost entirely limited to a band of primarily Spartina patens found at the margin of the sound and there were no signs of establishing the typical zonation of back dune grasses, shrubs, and salt marsh. Evaluation of soil quality suggests that nutrients and organic material are not limiting recovery. Aeolian transport, however, was demonstrably higher across the filled area, where no dense stands of taller plants buffered the airflow. Plant re-establishment is suppressed by wind erosion inhibiting deposition of seeds. Recovery of the site will likely depend on the rhizomatous spread of S. patens from the sound shore. S. patens can then potentially facilitate the colonization of other species by buffering the wind and trapping seeds of other plants. Ironically, this slow recovery may benefit federally threatened bird species that require sparse vegetation for nesting success.

AB  - Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas whose emission from the largest source, wetlands is controlled by a number of environmental variables amongst which temperature, water-table, the availability of substrates and the CH4 transport properties of plants are most prominent and well characterised. Coastal wetland ecosystems are vulnerable to invasion by alien plant species which can make a significant local contribution to altering their species composition. However the effect of these changes in species composition on CH4 flux is rarely examined and so is poorly understood. Spartina alterniflora, a perennial grass native to North America, has spread rapidly along the south-east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. From 2002, this rapid invasion has extended to the tidal marshes of the Min River estuary, an area that, prior to invasion was dominated by the native plant Cyperus malaccensis. Here, we compare CH4 flux from the exotic invasive plant S. alterniflora with measurements from the aggressive native species Phragmites australis and the native species C. malaccensis following 3-years of monitoring. CH4 emissions were measured over entire tidal cycles. Soil CH4 production potentials were estimated for stands of each of above plants both in situ and in laboratory incubations. Mean annual CH4 fluxes from S. alterniflora, P. australis and C. malaccensis dominated stands over the 3 years were 95.7 (+/- 18.7), 38.9 (+/- 3.26) and 10.9 (+/- 5.26) g m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Our results demonstrate that recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora and the increasing presence of the native plant P. australis has significantly increased CH4 emission from marshes that were previously dominated by the native species C. malaccensis. We also conclude that higher above ground biomass, higher CH4 production and more effective plant CH4 transport of S. alterniflora collectively contribute to its higher CH4 emission in the Min River estuary.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is comprised of a myriad of macromolecules with specific physical and chemical properties that may influence the bioavailability of hydrophobic pesticides to animals. This study was conducted to assess the role of various forms of DOM on the uptake and bioconcentration of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos (CHPY) to the bivalve Mercenaria mercenaria. Bivalves were exposed to DOM-free seawater (30 parts per thousand) or to seawater containing a single form of DOM. DOM forms included two filtrate fractions of natural salt-marsh sediment DOM (DOM-(< 0.45 mu m) and DOM-(< 3 kDa)); natural purified humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids; and water soluble cyclic oligosaccharides alpha and beta cyclodextrins (CD-alpha and CD-beta).
   In C-14-CHPY uptake and elimination experiments, juvenile bivalves were exposed to uniformly-labeled C-14-CHPY and collected at time intervals during 48 h. The remaining bivalves were transferred to C-14-CHPY-free elimination chambers with bivalve collection at time intervals over 144 h. Total uptake of C-14-CHPY by bivalves in DOM-free seawater was > 40% greater than in bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the presence of most DOM forms. These results are consistent with much faster C-14-CHPY uptake rates estimated using a simple two parameter model. After the elimination period, bivalves exposed to DOM-free seawater had C-14-CHPY body residue concentrations between 25% and 86% greater than bivalves in the presence of DOM forms. Experiments with larger bivalves showed that pulse-chase exposures with a 1.5 h exposure period to C-14-CHPY was not long enough to detect differences in C-14-CHPY tissue accumulation efficiencies across treatments. Our findings suggest that natural forms of DOM, at environmentally realistic organic carbon concentrations, reduced pesticide uptake and bioconcentration, consistent with much lower uptake rates relative to bivalves exposed to C-14-CHPY in the absence of DOM. Interestingly, at the tested organic carbon concentrations CD-alpha and CD-beta did not reduce C-14-CHPY bioconcentration in M. mercenaria. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico began on April 20, originating in the deep sea 66 km off the Louisiana coast. By early June, DWH oil had spread to coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and western Florida. An estimated 2,113 km of shoreline were oiled, making DWH the largest marine oil spill in global history by length of affected shoreline. Additionally, a series of oil spill response measures were deployed, including diversions of Mississippi River discharge to forestall oil coming ashore, and the establishment of large-scale fishery closures, with both affecting coastal resources to varying degrees. Here, we review published studies and describe additional analyses evaluating long-term impacts of DWH on coastal/nearshore biological resources. We assembled time-series data collected by state, federal and academic partners on population abundance and environmental conditions to evaluate species and community change. Our study focused on plankton, invertebrates, fishes and dolphins, and 13 "key species" were selected to conduct semi-quantitative vulnerability-resilience (V-R) analyses. At one extreme, early life stages of Gulf Menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) were not affected due to seasonal spawning and larval development preceding the spill. In contrast, demographically independent populations of the common Bottlenose Dolphin, (Tursiops truncatus) suffered a variety of severe and ongoing health effects owing to oil exposure. Virtually all of the heavily oiled salt marsh habitat was in Louisiana, with the majority occurring in Barataria Bay. Multispecies trawl survey abundances declined post-DWH throughout eastern coastal Louisiana but remained stable elsewhere. A regime shift in composition of Barataria Bay trawl survey catches occurred during and following the spill, the persistence of which was associated with long-term reductions in average salinity and increases in water clarity. In some cases, fishery closures were associated with measurable but ephemeral increases in abundance of some targeted and bycatch species. Freshwater flooding of marshes was ineffective in preventing coastal oiling and severely affected benthic euryhaline resources including Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and Marsh Periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata). The flooding response measure experiment also indicates the directionality of impacts that further planned water diversions may have on ecological communities of lower Mississippi River basins.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents an important carbon phase in coastal environments and influences the partitioning of organic contaminants. In this study, we evaluated the role of salt-marsh sediment-derived DOM vs. DOM-free seawater on the acute and chronic toxicity of three pesticides (chlorothalonil-CHTH, chlorpyrifos-CHPY and fipronil-FIP) to the meiobenthic copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis. Acute toxicity was evaluated via standard 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50), while chronic toxicity was evaluated for 16 days using a 96-well microplate life-cycle bioassay. DOM significantly reduced (p < 0.05) acute toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to male and female copepods relative to copepods exposed in DOM-free seawater. In contrast, DOM elevated the acute toxicity of FIP to male copepods. In chronic exposures with/without DOM, CHTH and CHPY did not significantly affect copepodite-to-adult development. In these treatments, plus controls, the majority (95%) of copepodites developed into adults by 8 days. Individuals exposed to FIP in the presence of DOM showed a slower development rate than FIP individuals in DOM-free seawater. Overall, FIP exposed copepodites developed into adult copepods 4 days later than controls. CHTH, CHPY and FIP significantly reduced reproductive success by 33%, 31% and 89%, respectively. DOM, however, mitigated 30% (p=0.006) and 20% (p=0.05) of the reproductive failure attributed to CHTH and CHPY. FIP-induced reproductive failure was high (similar to 80%) in all exposures regardless of DOM presence/absence. An exponential growth model predicted that exposure to CHTH, CHPY and FIP in the absence of DOM significantly reduced (>= 38%) projected naupliar production relative to DOM-free controls. In the presence of DOM, naupliar production under CHTH and CHPY exposures was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from control projections. These results indicate that DOM generally reduced the acute and chronic toxicity of CHTH and CHPY to A. tenuiremis, while certain compound-specific pesticide (FIP): organic associations may enhance acute toxicity of FIP, particularly to male copepods.

AB  - In light of rising sea levels and increased storm surge hazards, detailed information on relative sea-level (RSL) histories and local controlling mechanisms is required to support future projections and to better prepare for future coastal-protection challenges. This study contributes to deciphering Holocene RSL changes at the German North Sea coast in high resolution by developing a transfer function for RSL change. Recent associations of Foraminifera and Ostracoda from low intertidal to supratidal settings of the barrier island of Spiekeroog in combination with environmental parameters (granulomeny, C/N, total organic carbon, salinity) were investigated and quantified in elevation steps of 15 cm in order to generate a first transfer function (TF) of Holocene RSL change. In a future step, the TF can be applied to the stratigraphic record. Our data show a clear vertical zonation of foraminifer and ostracod taxa between the middle salt marsh and the tidal flat with very few individuals in the sand flat area, suggesting removal by the tidal current or poor preservation. Multivariate statistics identify the elevation, corresponding to the inundation frequency, as main driving factor. The smallest vertical error (49 cm) is associated with an entirely new approach of combining Foraminifera and Ostracoda for a TF. Advantages of the TF over classical RSL indicators such as basal and intercalated peats - beside the relatively narrow indicative meaning - include the possible application to a wide range of intertidal facies and that the resulting RSL curve does not depend on compaction-prone peats.

AB  - A total of 270 soil samples from 30 different habitats in 10 geographic regions of California were evaluated for the presence of rhabditid entomopathogenic nematodes. Nematodes were isolated from 26.3% of the samples. The recovered isolates were identified as Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, S. kraussei, S. longicaudum, S. oregonense, Heterorhabditis marelatus and H.bacteriophora. Among the steinernematids, S. kraussei and S. feltiae were the most commonly encountered species, generally occurring in acidic soils high in organic matter. Among the heterorhabditids, H. bacteriophora was isolated along the southern coast, whereas H. marelatus was recovered along the northern coast of California. Steinernematids were recovered from coniferous forests, oak woodlands and grasslands whereas heterorhabditids were isolated from coastal marshes.

AB  - A three-year research project was conducted on Key Island, Collier County, Florida, USA, to evaluate an innovative attractant-based mosquito management technique. In the first year, species composition, relative abundance, and spatial distribution were determined. Although 16 species were collected, the dominant species was the black salt marsh mosquito, Aedes taeniorhynchus, which was the primary pest species. Efficacy of a single line barrier, consisting of 52 carbon dioxide (200 cc/min) + octenol (ca. 4 mg/h) baited traps (1994) or insecticide (lambdacyhalothrin) impregnated shade cloth targets (1995), spaced ca. 16.5 m apart, to reduce mosquito abundance in a resort area, was evaluated on the northern end of the island. Success was evaluated by means of baited surveillance traps located on both sides of the barrier. Traps and targets performed equally well. Though not statistically significant (p > 0.05), there was a reduction in mosquito abundance in the resort area when the barrier was functional. These data indicate that with refinement this mosquito management technique may be practical in certain situations.

AB  - An exotic grass Spartina alterniflora was intentionally introduced to Jiuduansha wetlands in Yangtze River estuary in 1997, and since then it had rapidly replaced native plant Scirpus mariqueter that used to dominate the estuarine salt marshes. We investigated consequences of S. alterniflora invasion to soil labile and recalcitrant C and N compared to the native S. mariqueter using soil fractionation and stable C and N isotopes. Results showed that S. alterniflora increased soil labile carbon (LC), recalcitrant carbon (RC), and soil recalcitrant nitrogen (RN) contents significantly (P < 0.05) in the upper soil layers (0-60 cm) compared to the S. mariqueter soil. Soil labile nitrogen (LN) in the S. alterniflora soil, however, remained lower than that in the S. mariqueter soil (P < 0.01), except for the surface soil layer (0-20 cm). The LC accounted for, on average, 36-38% of soil organic matter (SOM) in both communities, while labile N accounted for 32% of SOM in S. alterniflora soil and 48% in S. mariqueter soil. The delta C-13 values in S. alterniflora soil showed that S. alterniflora contributed on average 8.6% and 3.3% to the LC and RC pools, respectively, within the 0-100-cm soil layer. The greatest labile C contribution derived from S. alterniflora was found at the 40-cm soil whereas the proportion of recalcitrant C originating from S. alterniflora showed a decreasing trend with soil depth. These changes appeared to be associated with vertical distributions of roots and rhizodeposition. We also found that the delta N-15 values of SOM were more enriched in S. alterniflora soil compared to S. mariqueter soil, suggesting that greater SOM input by S. alterniflora residues would stimulate microbial activity rates that could lead to increased N turnover rates in S. alterniflora soil.

AB  - The U.K. has extensive databases on soils, land cover and historic land use change which have made it possible to construct a comprehensive inventory of the principal terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon for approximately the year 1990, using methods that are consistent with, and at least as accurate as, the revised 1996 guidelines recommended by IPCC where available - and including categories which are not currently considered under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This country inventory highlights issues concerning methodology, uncertainty, double counting, the importance of soils and the relative magnitude of sources and sinks which are reported to the UNFCCC relative to other sources and sinks.
   The carbon sinks (negative values in MtC a(-1)) for categories reported to the UNFCCC, based on the IPCC categories, were estimated to be: forest trees and litter (-2.1), U.K. forest products (-0.5, ignoring imports and exports), non-forest biomass (-0.3), forest soils (-0.1) and soils on set-aside land (-0.4). The carbon sources (positive values) reported under the UNFCCC were estimated to be: losses of soil organic carbon resulting from cultivation of semi-natural land (6.2) and from urbanization (1.6), drainage of peatlands (0.3) and fenlands (0.5), and peat extraction (0.2). A range of other sources and sinks not covered by the IPCC guidelines were also quantified, namely, the accumulation of carbon in undrained peatlands (-0.7, ignoring methane emission), sediment accretion in coastal marshes (-0.1), the possible U.K. share of the CO2 and N fertilization carbon sink (-2.0) and riverine organic and particulate carbon export to the sea (1.4, which may be assumed to be a source if most of this carbon is released as CO2 in the sea). All sinks totalled -6.2 and sources 10.2, giving a net flux to the atmosphere in 1990 of 4.0 MtC a(-)1. Uncertainties associated with categories, mostly based on best guesses, ranged from +/-15% for forest biomass and litter to +/-60% for CO2 and N fertilization.

AB  - Mangroves, seagrass meadows, and salt marshes, collectively termed "Blue Forests," are counted among the most valuable and productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. A recent literature review of the Blue Forest valuation research identified mangroves as the most frequently analyzed of these ecosystems, yet the literature demonstrates several deficits in terms of geographic location of studies, methods used to value the services, and most notably, a lack of valuation for cultural services. To better understand this, we analyzed the studies dealing specifically with mangroves from the original literature review to quantify what has been valued, where, by which methods, and the variation in the published values. We then use this information to synthesize our current level of knowledge on the type and value of services provided by mangroves, discuss data gaps, and address specifically the collection of data relevant to cultural ecosystem services (CES). Our results shed light on two principle issues affecting the mangrove valuation literature: overuse of benefit transfer in valuing mangrove ecosystem services and a lack of attention paid to the CES that mangroves provide. The mangrove valuation literature is not yet robust, lacking estimates of many ecosystem services, including CES, such as spiritual and aesthetic value. Most published studies focus on a small selection of ecosystem services based on the availability of benefit transfer values and the ability to easily measure values with market prices. Thus, many ecosystem services that cannot be valued monetarily, but that are often equally important to local communities, are ignored. Given the wide range of ecosystem services mangroves provide and the variety of valuation methods that need to be collectively employed, we argue that doing valuation studies well requires a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together anthropologists, social scientists, ecologists and economists. Thoughtfully and thoroughly including the local stakeholders in valuation studies and the resultant policy discussions leads to a more holistic understanding of the services mangroves provide, and viable solutions with an increase in local willingness to act in accordance with those solutions.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill released a large volume of C-13 and radiocarbon depleted organic matter to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of petroleum-derived carbon entering the offshore planktonic foodweb, as well as widespread oiling of coastal areas documented in previous studies suggests that hydrocarbons could have entered the near shore foodweb. To test this hypothesis, we measured radiocarbon (Delta C-14%) and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in an assortment of fish tissue, invertebrate tissue and shell samples collected within a year of the spill at seven sites from Louisiana to Florida USA across the northern Gulf of Mexico. We observed a west-east gradient with the most depleted radiocarbon values found in Terrebonne Bay, Louisana and increasingly enriched radiocarbon values in organisms collected at sites to the east. Depleted radiocarbon values as low as - 10% in invertebrate soft tissue from Terrebonne suggest assimilation of fossil carbon (2.8 +/- 1.2%), consistent with the hypothesis that organic matter from petrochemical reservoirs released during the Deepwater Horizon spill entered the coastal food web to a limited extent. Further there was a significant correlation between radiocarbon and delta C-13 values in invertebrate tissue consistent with this hypothesis. Both oyster tissue and hard head catfish tissue collected in impacted areas of coastal Louisiana were significantly depleted in C-14 and C-13 relative to organisms collected in the unaffected Apalachicola Bay, Florida (p < 0.014). Alternative explanations for these results include the influence of chronic hydrocarbon pollution along the western gulf coast or that the organisms ingest carbon derived from C-14 depleted organic matter mobilized during the erosion of coastal marshes in southern Louisiana.

AB  - Nutrient input through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rivals river inputs in certain regions and may play a significant role in nutrient cycling and primary productivity in the coastal ocean. In this paper, we review the key factors determining the fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) associated with SGD and present a compilation of measured rates. We show that, in particular, the water residence time and the redox conditions in coastal aquifers and sediments determine fluxes and ratios of N and P in SGD. In many coastal groundwater systems, and especially in contaminated aquifers, N/P ratios exceed those in river water and are higher than the Redfield ratio. Thus, anthropogenically driven increases in SGD of nutrients have the potential to drive the N-limited coastal primary production to P-limitation. River input of N and P to the coastal ocean has doubled over the past 50 yr. Results of a dynamic biogeochemical model for the C, N and P cycles of the global proximal coastal ocean (which includes large bays, the open water part of estuaries, deltas, inland seas and salt marshes), suggest that this has led to a factor 2 increase in primary production and. biomass and a decline in water column N/P ratios i.e. the system has become more N-limiting. With the same model, we show that an increase of SGD-N fluxes to similar to0.7-1.1 Tmol yr(-1) (with a SGD N/P ratio of 100; equal to similar to45-70% of pre-human riverine N-inputs) is required to drive the coastal ocean to P-limitation within the next 50 yr.

AB  - An overview is presented of the recent advancements in research activities conducted to evaluate mosquito traps, insecticide-impregnated targets baited with combinations of attractants, and strategies for using mass trapping techniques for adult mosquito population management. Technologies that use semiochemicals (attractants), traps and targets, and mass trapping are relatively new for management of adult mosquito populations. To date, emphasis has been placed primarily on developing barriers of attractant-baited and insecticide-impregnated targets. The most successful continuous use of this type of technology has been at Stevens' Landing, Collier County, Florida. Recently, commercially available traps have been evaluated for their ability to reduce nuisance populations of mosquitoes. Whereas use of Mosquito Magnet (TM) Pro (MM-Pro) traps along a nature trail on an isolated island (Atsena Otie) in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in a significant reduction in annoyance caused by the black salt-marsh mosquito, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (Wied.), a perimeter of the same traps did not result in the same level of mosquito reduction in a residential area in Gainesville, FL.

AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous in estuarine, coastal, and deep sea sediments. The impacts of microplastics on sedimentary microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles, however, have not been well reported. To evaluate if microplastics influence the composition and function of sedimentary microbial communities, we conducted a microcosm experiment using salt marsh sediment amended with polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane foam (PUF) or polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics. We report that the presence of microplastics alters sediment microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling processes. Compared to control sediments without microplastic, PUF- and PLA-amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification, while PVC amendment inhibits both processes. These results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes in sediments can be significantly affected by different microplastics, which may serve as organic carbon substrates for microbial communities. Considering this evidence and increasing microplastic pollution, the impact of plastics on global ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling merits critical investigation. Plastic pollution has infiltrated every ecosystem, but few studies have quantified the biogeochemical or ecological effects of plastic. Here the authors show that microplastics in ocean sediment can significantly alter microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling.

AB  - The flow of organic matter along the main navigation channel of Ria Formosa, Portugal, was assessed using determinations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM), and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations in conjunction with stable isotope values of primary producers, particulate matter, and two filter feeders. SPM in the lagoon is dominated by inorganic particles comprising 80% of total weight with organic matter averaging about 20%. The algal component of the POM averaged about 5% with the remainder comprised of detritus. The delta(13)C values of primary producers ranged from -9.1parts per thousand in the intertidal seagrass; Zostera noltii to -30.7parts per thousand in the red seaweed Bostrychia scorpioides revealing underlying differences in the mechanisms of carbon uptake. The delta(13)C value of B. scorpioides, which develops entangled on the salt marsh species Spartina maritima, suggests that its main source of inorganic carbon is atmospheric CO2. The delta(13)C Values of the high marsh macrophyte Sarcocornia perennis significantly increased with distance from the ocean while delta(13)C values of Z. noltii decreased, probably because higher decomposition of organic matter at inner stations lowers the delta(13)CO(2) value in the water. The delta(15)N values of Ulvales, seagrasses, and marsh plants significantly increased from outer stations to inner stations. This increase may be due either to recycling of nitrogen (N) within the marsh (with loss of light N-2 or NH4) or to inputs of isotopically heavy N from sewage. The delta(15)N values of particulate matter showed an opposite trend, which indicates higher microbial degradation of organic matter at the inner lagoon. The data demonstrate that the seston in the lagoon is a mixture of detritus from lagoon primary producers with a minor contribution of microalgae. The filter feeders are most likely assimilating a mixture of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. Digestion of lagoon seston is selective. The delta(15)N values of both muscle and digestive gland of filter feeders showed the opposite gradient of particulate matter indicating that the depleted delta(15)N of SPM at inner stations was not assimilated or even ingested. Stable isotopes values did not differ between the filter-feeders-the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis collected on buoys and the clam Tapes decussatus collected in the sediment-suggesting a considerable mixture of benthic-pelagic organic matter throughout the water column. Assessment of the changes in isotopic decomposition of detritus as it decays is required to refine our understanding of organic matter transfers in detrital food webs.

AB  - Bacterial competition for resources is common in nature but positive interactions among bacteria are also evident. We speculate that the structural complexity of substrate might play a role in mediating bacterial interactions. We tested the hypothesis that the frequency of antagonistic interactions among lignocellulolytic bacteria is reduced when complex polysaccharide is the main carbon source compared to when a simple sugar such as glucose is available. Results using all possible pairwise interactions among 35 bacteria isolated from salt marsh detritus showed that the frequency of antagonistic interactions was significantly lower on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-xylan medium (7.8%) than on glucose medium (15.5%). The two interaction networks were also different in their structures. Although 75 antagonistic interactions occurred on both media, there were 115 that occurred only on glucose and 20 only on CMC-xylan, indicating that some antagonistic interactions were substrate specific. We also found that the frequency of antagonism differed among phylogenetic groups. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacillus sp. were the most antagonistic and they tended to antagonize Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, the most susceptible groups. Results from the study suggest that substrate complexity affects how bacteria interact and that bacterial interactions in a community are dynamic as nutrient conditions change.

AB  - The spatial extent and vegetation characteristics of tidal wetlands and their change are among the biggest unknowns and largest sources of uncertainty in modeling ecosystem processes and services at the land-ocean interface. Using a combination of moderate-high spatial resolution (<= 30 meters) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, we evaluated several approaches for mapping and characterization of wetlands of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Sentinel-1A, Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), PALSAR-2, Sentinel-2A, and Landsat 8 imagery were used to map wetlands, with an emphasis on mapping tidal marshes, inundation extents, and functional vegetation classes (persistent vs. non-persistent). We performed initial characterizations at three target wetlands study sites with distinct geomorphologies, hydrologic characteristics, and vegetation communities. We used findings from these target wetlands study sites to inform the selection of timeseries satellite imagery for a regional scale random forest-based classification of wetlands in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Acquisition of satellite imagery, raster manipulations, and timeseries analyses were performed using Google Earth Engine. Random forest classifications were performed using the R programming language. In our regional scale classification, estuarine emergent wetlands were mapped with a producer's accuracy greater than 88% and a user's accuracy greater than 83%. Within target wetland sites, functional classes of vegetation were mapped with over 90% user's and producer's accuracy for all classes, and greater than 95% accuracy overall. The use of multitemporal SAR and multitemporal optical imagery discussed here provides a straightforward yet powerful approach for accurately mapping tidal freshwater wetlands through identification of non-persistent vegetation, as well as for mapping estuarine emergent wetlands, with direct applications to the improved management of coastal wetlands.

AB  - Seasonal monitoring was carried out to investigate the influence of extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) on metal speciation and organic matter cycling in the rhizosediment of Spartina maritima. Heavy metal speciation was achieved by the Tessier scheme, and showed a similar pattern of variation of the organic-bound fraction, indicating a decomposition process in progress. Both humic acid and organic matter showed the same seasonal pattern. The basal respiration of the rhizosediments also presented a similar seasonal pattern, indicating a microbial degradation of organic matter. The high organic-bound fraction found in the summer gradually decreased towards the winter. This decrease was found to be related to the increase of activity of peroxidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and protease. Also the activity of sulphatase was found to be related to the depletion on the exchangeable fraction, probably due to sulphide formation and consequent mobilization. The results show an interaction between several microbial activities, affecting metal speciation.

AB  - 1 Canopy-level CO2 exchange and biomass were measured monthly for 9 consecutive months during 1990 on grazed and non-grazed portions of a Danish salt marsh dominated by Spartina anglica. The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP).
   2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and 1.1 +/- 0.2 kg m(-2) (+/- 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 +/- 0.1 and 0.5 +/- 0.05 kg m(-2)), were achieved during July at the grazed site.
   3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm(-3) at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter.
   4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m(-2) year(-1) at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m(-2) year(-1), did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m(-2) year(-1)) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 mol m(-2) year(-1)), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores.
   5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window. It was shown that canopy biomass on the grazed site was close to the theoretical optimum biomass late in the season, while the non-grazed canopy biomass was supraoptimal.

AB  - This study was undertaken to elucidate the impact of early diagenetic processes on the accumulation of trace metals in Sapelo Island salt-marsh sediments as a function of time, space and sediment properties. Samples were collected from three sites in summer (May 1997) and winter (January 1998) along a transect from an unvegetated Creek Bank through a vegetated Tidal Levee to the vegetated midmarsh with evident lateral heterogeneity caused by hydrologic regime, macrophytes and microbial and macrofaunal activities. A suite of trace metals (As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Cd, Mo, Ni, Pb, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) was analyzed to obtain their depth-distribution at the three sites. Spatially marked differences were observed, that were primarily related to hydraulic flushing of trace metals away from the sites in high-energy regimes, rapid downward mixing and reworking of sediment via bioturbation, and below-ground degradation and production of Spartina biomass. Although sulfate reduction and the formation of acid volatile sulfide and pyrite were dominant processes throughout the marsh, the trace metal scavenging role of sulfides was not apparent. However, possible sulfurization of organic matter, leading to enhanced trapping of trace metals with organic carbon, may have played an important role in sequestration of trace metals.
   No similarity was observed visually between the depth trends of trace metals and sediment properties (grain size, iron-oxyhydroxide content, acid volatile sulfides and pyrite content) that are known to play a major role in trace metal partitioning. Only organic carbon content closely followed the trace metal profiles at all the three sites. Minor variation in depth-integrated sediment trace metal content was observed seasonally at each of the three sites. Furthermore, the depth trend of profiles of individual trace metals also did not vary significantly over the seasons either. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, salt marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, comprise some of the world's most productive and ecologically significant ecosystems. Currently, the predominant factor considered in valuing coastal wetlands as fish habitats is the contribution they make to offshore, adult fish stocks via ontogenetic migrations. However, the true value of coastal nurseries for fish is much more extensive, involving several additional, fundamentally important ecosystem processes. Overlooking these broader aspects when identifying and valuing habitats risks suboptimal conservation outcomes, especially given the intense competing human pressures on coastlines and the likelihood that protection will have to be focussed on specific locations rather than across broad sweeps of individual habitat types. We describe 10 key components of nursery habitat value grouped into three types: (1) connectivity and population dynamics (includes connectivity, ontogenetic migration and seascape migration), (2) ecological and ecophysiological factors (includes ecotone effects, ecophysiological factors, food/predation trade-offs and food webs) and (3) resource dynamics (includes resource availability, ontogenetic diet shifts and allochthonous inputs). By accounting for ecosystem complexities and spatial and temporal variation, these additional components offer a more comprehensive account of habitat value. We explicitly identify research needs and methods to support a broader assessment of nursery habitat value. We also explain how, by better synthesising results from existing research, some of the seemingly complex aspects of this broader view can be addressed efficiently.

AB  - A characteristic feature of lagoons and estuaries along the Baltic Sea is the dominance of reed (Phragmites australis) along their coasts. Reed wetlands are ecologically valuable ecosystems and play an important role for nutrient and matter cycling as well as for biodiversity. They provide a broad spectrum of ecosystem services and have been utilized by humans already for centuries. We assess the ecosystem service provision of reed wetlands and analyze how this is affected by different management scenarios and how the results of an expert-based ecosystem service assessment can be used in practice. Because of strong internal gradients and interactions with the surrounding, coastal reed belts show a higher ecosystem service provision compared to homogeneous inland reed. The three different coastal management scenarios are (1) winter harvest of reed, (2) summer harvest of reed, and (3) grazing by livestock. According to the views of 18 involved experts from Lithuania, Poland, and Germany, winter harvest is regarded as the scenario with the lowest conflict potential between nature protection and reed utilization. Experts expect no changes or even slight increases for regulating and cultural services. However, experts see the need to establish a sustainable and regionally anchored winter harvest concept. Summer harvest and grazing entail the risk to change the ecosystem structure and could lead to a shift in vegetation pattern toward short salt marsh grassland. Experts expect a slight decrease in regulating services. In particular, erosion control, biodiversity, and nutrient sequestration are rated controversially. To our experience, these expert-based ecosystem service assessments can support policy implementation (e.g., NATURA 2000, European Water Framework Directive or Marine Strategy Framework Directive). It can serve as a tool that allows stakeholders to visualize trade-offs, analyze patterns and processes at regional scales, and hence facilitate decision-making.

AB  - We investigated spatial and temporal changes in sources of organic matter in sediments within an estuarine environment in South Africa using fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (SI). Samples of sediments and sources of organic matter [i.e., particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos (MPB), macrophytes, salt marsh plants, and terrestrial leaves] were collected during spring and summer 2012, and autumn and winter 2013 from the upper, middle, and lower reaches. A Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) mixing model was used to identify the organic matter sources contributing to sediments in each estuarine reach and season. We found that diatom-associated fatty acids (20:5 omega 3; 16:1 omega 7) increased toward the upper reaches, while long-chained terrigenous fatty acids (24:0) tended to be more prevalent in lower reach sediments. In support of the FA results, the SI mixing model showed a substantial contribution from the marsh grass Spartina maritima in sediments of the lower estuary during periods of low-freshwater discharge (autumn and winter), while MPB was the main component in sediments from the upper and middle reaches during all seasons. Our results have implications for evaluating estuarine food webs since the spatial and seasonal variability in the organic matter deposited can influence estuarine community structure.

AB  - Since the 1970s, a breeding colony of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens L.) at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, has grown 8% annually. This increase has led to significant loss of plant cover in all major salt- and freshwater coastal habitats between 1976 and 1997. A series of transects established in 1976 was resurveyed in 1997. Exposed sediment, extent and type of vegetative cover, and aquatic areas were recorded along transects using a classification of 12 a priori classes. Five regions within the colony were identified, and changes in vegetation cover differed among these and depended on unique combinations of vegetation class and year. Grubbing by geese has led to loss of graminoid plants, especially in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Exposed sediments have largely replaced previously vegetated areas since 1976. Species characteristic of disturbed sites have colonized exposed sediment with the most abundant species varying according to soil conditions. In intertidal marshes, willow cover declined in association with the development of hypersalinity after loss of the graminoid mat, but willow cover increased at the base of well-drained beach ridges and in a river delta with ample winter snow accumulation and freshwater flow in spring that protected ground vegetation. Most of the expected successional trends associated with isostatic uplift and changes in soil organic matter failed to occur because of intense goose foraging throughout the 20 years. The likelihood of sustained recovery of plant communities in the immediate coastal zone is very low, as long as goose numbers continue to increase. Indirect effects of vegetation loss (e.g., hypersalinity) and subsequent erosion of exposed sediments following grubbing will delay plant colonization and retard succession.

AB  - Piers may impact the health of coastal wetlands by altering vegetation, soil organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition or erosion. Permit requests for piers have recently increased in the U.S. leading to concern by environmental regulatory agencies on potential impacts. In response, a project was conducted in Maryland to assess the impacts of long piers on plant communities, soils, and marsh surface characteristics. Twenty sites with piers and 20 control sites were assessed. Control sites and pier sites were similar with respect to soil types, marsh surface characteristics, and plant community composition. Shading consistently reduced vegetation density directly beneath piers and occasionally reduced vegetation density adjacent to piers. Shading favored Spartina alterniflora over Distichlis spicata, and Distichlis spicata over Spartina patens. Distribution of marsh surface components (high marsh, low marsh, mudflats, open water) was unaffected by proximity to piers. Direct evidence of pier effects on erosion or deposition was limited to the immediate vicinity of a few piers. In general, thickness of the organic horizons or that of the root mats was unaffected by proximity to a pier. We concluded that any effects of piers on vegetation or erosion were restricted to the close proximity of the piers.

AB  - The sources and distribution of organic matter (OM) in surface waters and sediments from Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) were investigated using a variety of analytical techniques, including elemental, stable isotope and organic biomarker analyses. Several locations along the estuary salinity gradient were sampled during four different periods of contrasting river discharge and tidal ranee. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters ranged from 7 mg l(-1) in the lower bay stations closest to the ocean to 20 mg l(-1) in the river and upper bay samples. There was a general linear relationship between DOC concentrations and salinity in three of the four sampling periods. In contrast, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were significantly lower (0.1-3 mg l(-1)) and showed no relationship with salinity. The high molecular weight dissolved OM (HMW DOM) isolated from selected water samples collected along the bay displayed atomic carbon: nitrogen ratios ([C/N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic carbon (delta(13)C(OC)) that ranged from 10 to 30 and from -28 to -25parts per thousand, respectively. Combined, such compositions indicate that in most HMW DOM samples, the majority of the OM originates from terrigenous sources, with smaller contributions from riverine and estuarine phytoplankton. In contrast, the [C/N]a ratios of particulate OM (POM) samples varied significantly among the collection periods, ranging from low values of similar to5 to high values of >20. Overall, the trends in [C/N]a ratios indicated that algal sources of POM were most important during the early and late summer, whereas terrigenous sources dominated in the winter and early spring.
   In Winyah Bay bottom sediments, the concentrations of the mineral-associated OM were positively correlated with sediment surface area. The [C/N]a ratios and delta(13)C(OC) compositions of the bulk sedimentary OM ranged from 5 to 45 and from -28 to -23parts per thousand, respectively. These compositions were consistent with predominant contributions of terrigenous sources and lesser (but significant) inputs of freshwater, estuarine and marine phytoplankton. The highest terrigenous contents were found in sediments from the river and upper bay sites, with smaller contributions to the lower parts of the estuary. The yields of lignin-derived CuO oxidation products from Winyah Bay sediments indicated that the terrigenous OM in these samples was composed of variable mixtures of relatively fresh vascular plant detritus and moderately altered soil OM. Based on the lignin phenol compositions, most of this material appeared to be derived from angiosperm and gymnosperm vascular plant sources similar to those found in the upland coastal forests in this region. A few samples displayed lignin compositions that suggested a more significant contribution from marsh C-3 grasses. However, there was no evidence of inputs of Spartina alterniflora (a C-4 grass) remains from the salt marshes that surround the lower sections of Winyah Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plant invasion typically alters the microbial communities of soils, which affects ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. The responses of the soil fungal communities to plant invasion along its chronosequence remain poorly understood. For this study, we investigated variations in soil fungal communities through Illumina MiSeq sequencing analyses of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), along a chronosequence (i.e., 9-, 13-, 20- and 23-year-old) of invasive Spartina alterniflora. We compared these variations with those of bare flat in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland. Our results highlighted that the abundance of soil fungi, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), species richness, and Shannon diversity indices for soil fungal communities were highest in 9-year-old S. alterniflora soil, which gradually declined along the invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of copiotrophic Basidiomycota revealed significant decreasing trend, while the relative abundance of oligotrophic Ascomycota gradually increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The relative abundance of soil saprotrophic fungi (e.g., undefined saprotrophs) was gradually reduced while symbiotic fungi (e.g., ectomycorrhizal fungi) and pathotrophic fungi (e.g., plant and animal pathogens) progressively increased along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. Our results suggested that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil fungal abundance and diversity, community composition, trophic modes, and functional groups along a chronosequence, via substantially reduced soil litter inputs, and gradually decreased soil pH, moisture, and soil nutrient substrates along the invasion chronosequence, from 9 to 23 years. These changes in soil fungal communities, particularly their trophic modes and functional groups along the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence could well impact the decomposition and accumulation of soil C and N. while potentially altering ecosystem C and N sinks in a Chinese Yellow Sea coastal wetland.

AB  - The formation of Eastern Mediterranean organic matter rich deposits known as sapropels is the results of two mechanisms: (enhanced) marine productivity and preservation of organic material at depth. However, their relative contribution and their leads and lags with respect to each other remain elusive. Here, we address these questions by studying sediments deposited prior to, during, and after the most recent sapropel (S1, similar to 10-6 calibrated ka before present, BP) with an integrated marine and terrestrial palynological approach, combined with existing and newly generated geochemical data. The studied core was retrieved from an area under strong influence of the Nile outflow and has high average sediment accumulation rates allowing a high temporal resolution (of several decades to centuries). Marine productivity, as reconstructed with total dinocyst accumulation rates (ARs) and biogenic CaCO3 content, starts to increase similar to 1 ka prior to sapropel formation. A shift in the dinocyst taxa contributing to the productivity signal at sapropel onset indicates the rapid development of (seasonal) water column stratification. Pollen and spore ARs also increase prior to sapropel onset, but a few centuries after the increase in marine productivity. Hence, the first shift to a high marine productivity system before sapropel deposition may have been mostly favoured by the injection of nutrients via shoaling of the nutricline with a minor contribution of nutrients from land via river input and flooding of the shelves. Pollen assemblages indicate a gradual change across the sapropel onset from a savanna-like, through coastal marsh expansion, toward an open woodland assemblage, which is consistent with enhanced Nile influence and delta development. At sapropel onset a marked shift in pollen ARs could suggest increased preservation under anoxia. However, major shifts in pollen assemblages and signs of selective- or partial decomposition of terrestrial palynomorphs are absent. We therefore suggest that the high pollen ARs largely result from an increased influx of pollen by enhanced Nile discharge and extension of the freshwater plume. Three centuries after the sapropel onset, dinocyst ARs and CaCO3 content indicate that marine productivity starts to decrease, while sapropel deposition continued. Organic carbon content decreased only later and less dramatically. This may be explained by a shift in the dominance of the organisms contributing to marine productivity, to an enhanced preservation of organic matter, or a combination of both. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Saltmarshes, known to be ecologically sensitive areas, face disturbances such as vegetation dieback due to anthropogenic activities such as construction. The current construction specifications recommended by state highway agencies do not specifically require documenting or restoring any prior saltmarsh soil/interstitial water properties, nor do they require re-establishing saltmarsh vegetation; restoring the abiotic properties and appropriate vegetation would enhance the long-term functionality and ecology of a disturbed area. In order to have a successful restoration of disturbed saltmarshes with healthy vegetation, the relationship between vegetative species and the properties of saltmarsh soils and interstitial water must be fully understood. In this study, field and laboratory tests were conducted for the soil samples from eight different saltmarsh sites in the Southeastern US Atlantic coastal region, followed by the development of a random forest model; the aim is to identify correlation among saltmarsh predominant vegetation types, redox potential, and salinity. The results reveal that moisture content and sand content are two main drivers for the bulk density of saltmarsh soils, which directly affect plant growth and likely root development. Moreover, it is concluded that deploying modern machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, can help to identify desirable saltmarsh soil/water properties for re-establishing vegetative cover with the reduced time after construction activities.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the sediment quality in the mesotidal Douro River estuarine environment, in order to identify areas where sediment contamination could cause ecosystem degradation. Samples were obtained in five locations and sediment characterised for grain size, total organic matter, total-recoverable metals (Al, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn and Mn), as well as acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM). In situ effects were evaluated by examining the macrobenthic community structure. An elutriate sediment toxicity test (ESTT) was used to estimate the amount of metals and nutrients that could be exchanged with the water column through resuspension, and its positive or negative effects on the growth of the micro-alga Emiliania huxleyi in a 10 day test. Anthropogenic metal contamination was identified at the north bank of the Douro estuary, with deleterious effects on the macrobenthic community, namely decrease in number of species and diversity. This contamination could possibly also be toxic for water column organisms, in case of resuspension, as shown by the ESTT. Sediments from the salt marsh at the south bank showed an impoverished macrobenthic community and elutriate toxicity, which appeared to be due to anaerobic conditions. This study clearly shows the usefulness of the ESST approach to assess the biological effect of resuspension of estuarine sediments.

AB  - Assessing large scale plant productivity of coastal marshes is essential to understand the resilience of these systems to climate change. Two machine learning approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) regression were tested to estimate biomass of a common saltmarshes species, salt couch grass (Sporobolus virginicus). Reflectance and vegetation indices derived from 8 bands of Worldview-2 multispectral data were used for four experiments to develop the biomass model. These four experiments were, Experiment-1: 8 bands of Worldview-2 image, Experiment-2: Possible combination of all bands of Worldview-2 for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) type vegetation indices, Experiment-3: Combination of bands and vegetation indices, Experiment-4: Selected variables derived from experiment-3 using variable selection methods. The main objectives of this study are (i) to recommend an affordable low cost data source to predict biomass of a common saltmarshes species, (ii) to suggest a variable selection method suitable for multispectral data, (iii) to assess the performance of RF and SVM for the biomass prediction model. Cross-validation of parameter optimizations for SVM showed that optimized parameter of e-SVR failed to provide a reliable prediction. Hence, nu-SVR was used for the SVM model. Among the different variable selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE) selected a minimum number of variables (only 4) with an RMSE of 0.211 (kg/m2). Experiment-4 (only selected bands) provided the best results for both of the machine learning regression methods, RF (R-2= 0.72, RMSE= 0.166 kg/m2) and SVR (R-2= 0.66, RMSE = 0.200 kg/m2) to predict biomass. When a 10-fold cross validation of the RF model was compared with a 10-fold cross validation of SVR, a significant difference (p = <0.0001) was observed for RMSE. One to one comparisons of actual to predicted biomass showed that RF underestimates the high biomass values, whereas SVR overestimates the values; this suggests a need for further investigation and refinement.

AB  - To get further insights into the development of landscape elements and soils of North Sea barrier islands; an old part in the West (formed between approx. 1650-1860) and a young part, largely unaffected by anthropogenic influences in the East (formed approx. 1960), of the island Spiekeroog were comparatively analyzed. Between the two parts beach soils (World Reference Base of Soil Resources (WRB), IWG WRB (2015): Eutric Huvic Tiadalic and Eutric Endosalic Arenosols; German Soil Classification System (GSCS), AD-Hoc-AG BODEN (2005): Nassstrand and Strand) did not differ, except for microbial mats, which were found only in the East. In the West, a dune complex comprising white, gray and brown dunes holds a soil chronosequence from unaltered sands (WRB: Eutric Protic Arenosol; GSCS: Lockersyrosem) to braunified and podzolized soils (With: Dystric Brunk Arenosol; GSCS: Braunerde). However, in the East, only a single white dune chain, with adjacent shallow dune mounds to the south, had formed. In both parts, dune slacks evinced remarkably rapid peat formation (WRB: Dystric Histic and Eutric Histic Gleysols; GSCS: Niedermoorgleye). Here, iron content of groundwaters determined the formation of redoximorphic features. Soils of the salt marshes (WRB: Eutric Fluvic and Eutric Gleysols; GSCS: Rohmarschen) showed the highest contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the West, where the thickest fine sediment layers were also found. Revealed shortcomings of the German soil classification system concerning the classification of 'Strand' and 'Rohmarsch' soils are discussed. It is suggested to exclude the obligatory carbonate (CaCO3) content in the definition of the Strand soil and to introduce an additional horizon prefix to indicate carbonate contents between > 0 and < 2%, in order to classify Rohmarsch soils, with primary carbonate contents < 2%. Finally, an outlook on the future landscape -and soil development is provided, which is expected to be most profound in the young East.

AB  - Large river deltas are complex ecosystems that are believed to play a pivotal role in promoting the early marine growth and survival of threatened Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We used a fish bioenergetics model to assess the functional role of multiple delta habitats across a gradient of salinities and vegetation types, where consumption and growth rate potential (GRP) were considered as proxies for habitat quality. We subsequently compared our model output to empirical, or realized, growth estimates from scale circuli. In terms of consumption, prey energy density (EDprey) was 46-86% higher in tidal freshwater forest than in any other habitat type, while estimated consumption rates (expressed as proportion of maximum daily consumption; P-cmax) were positively correlated with FL. These size-related differences in P-cmax led to a noticeable increase along a freshwater-to-saline gradient from roughly 0.25 in tidal freshwater forest to 0.55 in the offshore subtidal zone, yet despite higher observed P-cmax values in nearshore and offshore habitats, the tidal freshwater forest and emergent salt marsh demonstrated the highest modeled GRP values. Similarly, realized growth rates for fish caught in tidal freshwater forest were up to 0.5% higher per day than for fish caught in the offshore area, but habitat-level differences were overshadowed by allometry and rearing origin. Scales from unmarked fish (assumed to be of wild origin) indicated that they grew, on average, 11% faster than did hatchery fish; however, these differences were subtle and were more obvious at fork lengths <100 mm. Our results suggest that tidal forests and emergent marshes may offer early life growth advantages for wild Chinook Salmon, but that wild and hatchery fish can compensate as they move seaward by opportunistically consuming greater quantities of low-energy density prey, taking advantage of pulses of larval forage fish, or by spending time in multiple interconnected habitat types.

AB  - It is widely recognized that wetlands, especially those rich in organic matter and receiving appreciable atmospheric mercury (Hg) inputs, are important sites of methylmercury (MeHg) production. Extensive wetlands in the southeastern United States have many ecosystem attributes ideal for promoting high MeHg production rates; however, relatively few mercury cycling studies have been conducted in these environments. We conducted a landscape scale study examining Hg cycling in coastal Louisiana (USA) including four field trips conducted between August 2003 and May 2005. Sites were chosen to represent different ecosystem types, including: a large shallow eutrophic estuarine lake (Lake Pontchartrain), three rivers draining into the lake, a cypress-tupelo dominated freshwater swamp, and six emergent marshes ranging from a freshwater marsh dominated by Panicum hemitomon to a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh close to the Gulf of Mexico. We measured MeHg and total Hg (THg) concentrations, and ancillary chemical characteristics, in whole and filtered surface water, and filtered porewater.
   Overall, MeHg concentrations were greatest in surface water of freshwater wetlands and lowest in the profundal (non-vegetated) regions of the lake and river mainstems. Concentrations of THg and MeHg in filtered surface water were positively correlated with the highly reactive, aromatic (hydrophobic organic acid) fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These results suggest that DOC plays an important role in promoting the mobility, transport and bioavailability of inorganic Hg in these environments. Further, elevated porewater concentrations in marine and brackish wetlands suggest coastal wetlands along the Gulf Coast are key sites for MeHg production and may be a principal source of MeHg to foodwebs in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Examining the relationships among MeHg, THg, and DOC across these multiple landscape types is a first step in evaluating possible links between key zones for Hg(II)-methylation and the bioaccumulation of mercury in the biota inhabiting the Gulf of Mexico region.

AB  - Bacterial isolates were obtained from enrichment cultures containing humic substances extracted from estuarine water using an XAD-8 resin. Eighteen isolates were chosen for phylogenetic and physiological characterization based on numerical importance in serial dilutions of the enrichment culture and unique colony morphology. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that six of the isolates were associated with the a subclass of Proteobacteria, three with the gamma -Proteobacteria, and nine with the Gram-positive bacteria. Ten isolates degraded at least one (and up to six) selected aromatic single-ring compounds. Six isolates showed ability to degrade [C-14]humic substances derived from the dominant salt marsh grass in the estuary from which they were isolated (Spartina alterniflora), mineralizing 0.4-1.1% of the humic substances over 4 weeks. A mixture of all Is isolates did not degrade humic substances significantly faster than any of the individual strains, however, and no isolate degraded humic substances to the same extent as the natural marine bacterial community (3.0%). Similar studies with a radiolabeled synthetic lignin ([beta-C-14]dehydropolymerisate) showed measurable levels of degradation by all 18 bacteria (3.0-8.8% in 4 weeks), but mineralization levels were again lower than that observed for the natural marine bacterial community (28.2%). Metabolic capabilities of the Is isolates were highly Variable and generally did not map to phylogenetic affiliation. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the elemental and stable isotope composition of Zostera noltii leaves during the early phases of decay. The litter biomass, the C, N and S elemental contents, the C:N ratios and the delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 values were monitored in a litterbag experiment for 60 days at Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal in two different field conditions, permanently submerged in a salt marsh pond and at high intertidal. The elemental and stable isotope composition of both attached leaves and leaf wrack of Z. noltii was also determined. The overall decay rate of Z. noltii leaf material throughout the whole experimental period was k = 0.016 +/- 0.001 d(-1). Even though the biomass loss of the Z. noltii leaves after 30 days was about 25% higher within the pond than at the high intertidal, at the end of the experiment there were no significant differences between sites. The decay of the C and N content was of the same magnitude and thus the C:N molar ratio did not vary significantly in the experiment. The elemental content of the leaf wrack was in the range of the element content of leaf litter after 30-60 days of incubation. Contrary to other vascular plants rich in lignin, which degrades slowly, and thus forces the decrease of the delta C-13 values during decay, the delta C-13 values of Z. noltii leaves did not vary significantly over time or between incubation sites. The 515 N values of leaves did not increase as has been reported for vascular plants with high C:N ratio. This suggests that during the early phase of the Z. noltii decomposition the community of decomposers relied mostly on the endogenous nitrogen of the plants, not needing to immobilize exogenous N. Stable isotope studies to assess the contribution of this species to the food web can rely on the natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundances of living tissues without any correction to account for decomposition. The analysis of the delta S-34 values of Z. noltii detritus was not useful probably due to the contamination of the samples with pyrite, which has a depleted delta S-34 signal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concentrations of dissolved acidic polysaccharides (dAPS) were measured in an estuarine tidal creek in North Inlet (South Carolina) during June and August 2007. There was a predictable pattern of dAPS concentrations in Crab Haul Creek, with the highest concentrations of dAPS occurring at low tide (2490 +/- 300 mu g L(-1) [mean +/- SD] as gum xanthan equivalents). Suspended sediment load positively correlated with dAPS concentrations during a 12-h survey over a complete tidal cycle at a single location. There was a significant correlation between chlorophyll a and dAPS in the upper 5 mm of intertidal salt marsh sediments. High dAPS concentrations (3170-7820 mg m(2)) in emersed intertidal sediment at low tide compared with depth-integrated water-column dAPS (100-370 mg m(2)) indicate that the sediment was potentially the major source of dAPS to the water column. Total dAPS in the water column overlying the 1.1-km(2) area of Crab Haul Creek basin varied between 10967 to 4066 225 kg (mean +/- SD) as gum xanthan equivalents over a tidal cycle. Conservative estimate of dAPS export from North Inlet to the Atlantic Ocean as organic carbon was 5.00 x 10(8) g C during the summer, or 1.32 x 10(9) g C annually. The spatiotemporal distributions of dAPS indicate that they are a significant pool of organic carbon in estuaries.

AB  - Plant rhizospheres are dynamic environments in which microbes compete for resources, particularly plant-derived organic carbon/energy sources. Altering plant productivity changes the availability of carbon/energy resources to rhizosphere microbiota. This limitation is expected to intensify competition for the remaining carbon supply and could cause the loss of poor competitors from the assemblage. We clipped or shaded plots of the salt marsh cord grass, Spartina alterniflora, to shift plant carbon resource allocation from the rhizosphere to the aboveground shoots. We then examined key porewater parameters (pH, salinity, H2S, NH4+), diazotrophic activity (by acetylene reduction assay), and diazotroph assemblage composition after 2 weeks or 8 weeks of treatment. The diazotroph assemblage composition was monitored via the polymerase chain reaction using nifH specific primers followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Porewater parameters and acetylene reduction rates did not differ significantly among treatments. The DGGE profiles also were very similar across the control and experimental treatments, indicating that no detectable diazotroph species were displaced from the assemblage. This implies that rhizosphere diazotrophs are able to compete successfully against nondiazotrophs, in spite of the high energy requirements of nitrogen fixation. These results show that the species composition of the diazotroph assemblage in the S. alterniflora rhizosphere is stable in the face of short-duration but potentially high-impact variations in carbon resource availability.

AB  - Climate change can strongly alter soil microbial functioning via plant-microbe interactions, often with important consequences for ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Given the high degree of intraspecific trait variability in plants, it has been hypothesized that genetic shifts within plant species yield a large potential to control the response of plant-microbe interactions to climate change. Here we examined if sea-level rise and plant genotype interact to affect soil microbial communities in an experimental coastal wetland system, using two known genotypes of the dominant salt-marsh grass Elymus athericus characterized by differences in their sensitivity to flooding stress - i.e., a tolerant genotype from low-marsh environments and an intolerant genotype from high-marsh environments. Plants were exposed to a large range of flooding frequencies in a factorial mesocosm experiment, and soil microbial activity parameters (exo-enzyme activity and litter breakdown) and microbial community structure were assessed. Plant genotype mediated the effect of flooding on soil microbial community structure and determined the presence of flooding effects on exo-enzyme activities and belowground litter breakdown. Larger variability in microbial community structure, enzyme activities, and litter breakdown in soils planted with the intolerant plant genotype supported our general hypothesis that effects of climate change on soil microbial activity and community structure can depend on plant intraspecific genetic variation. In conclusion, our data suggest that adaptive genetic variation in plants could suppress or facilitate the effects of sea-level rise on soil microbial communities. If this finding applies more generally to coastal wetlands, it yields important implications for our understanding of ecosystem-climate feedbacks in the coastal zone.

AB  - We compared the distribution and nutrient status of native haplotype F of Phragmites australis along the freshwater to mesohaline tidal marsh gradient of the Rappahannock River, Virginia, for comparison with the normative, invasive haplotype M. Using GIS analysis of aerial photography and GPS-based ground truthing, we identified 55 separate clones of native haplotype F comprising a total of 3.68 ha (range 0.002-0.734 ha), all found in tidal wetlands where surface water salinity was 0 psu. We identified 219 separate clones of the invasive haplotype M covering 68.3 ha along the same stretch of river (range 0.004-11.86 ha), found in wetlands where salinity ranged from 0 to I I psu. From 15 separate clones for each haplotype, average carbon content in leaves of the native was significantly higher than the invasive (43.90 +/- 0.08% versus 42.82 +/- 0.15%, F-1,F-28 = 20.938, p < 0.01), and nitrogen content was significantly lower (2.22 +/- 0.03% versus 2.58 +/- 0.07%, 171,21 11.972, p < 0.01). The average C:N:P ratio for leaf tissue was 1100:48:1 for haplotype F and 1084:56:1 for haplotype M. Relative to the native, the invasive haplotype forms larger stands distributed throughout a broader estuarine reach and incorporates more nitrogen in leaf tissue. From a management standpoint, native Phragmites protection should focus on deterring normative haplotype invasion through the minimization of both adjacent upland disturbance and nutrient enrichment in tidal freshwater marshes.

AB  - Recent interest in the ocean's capacity to absorb atmospheric CO2 and buffer the accompanying "ocean acidification" has prompted discussions on the magnitude of ocean margin alkalinity production via anaerobic processes. However, available estimates are largely based on gross reaction rates or misconceptions regarding reaction stoichiometry. In this paper, we argue that net alkalinity gain does not result from the internal cycling of nitrogen and sulfur species or from the reduction of metal oxides. Instead, only the processes that involve permanent loss of anaerobic remineralization products, i.e., nitrogen gas from net denitrification and reduced sulfur (i.e., pyrite burial) from net sulfate reduction, could contribute to this anaerobic alkalinity production. Our revised estimate of net alkalinity production from anaerobic processes is on the order of 4-5 Tmol yr(-1) in global ocean margins that include both continental shelves and oxygen minimum zones, significantly smaller than the previously estimated rate of 16-31 Tmol yr(-1). In addition, pyrite burial in coastal habitats (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows) may contribute another 0.1-1.1 Tmol yr(-1), although their long-term effect is not yet clear under current changing climate conditions and rising sea levels. Finally, we propose that these alkalinity production reactions can be viewed as "charge transfer" processes, in which negative charges of nitrate and sulfate ions are converted to those of bicarbonate along with a net loss of these oxidative anions.

AB  - The Tubul-Raqui estuary is a coastal system off central Chile at 37 degrees S, adjacent to an active coastal upwelling area, which undergoes rapid changes associated with natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578%) and CH4 (up to 6200%) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from -319 to 714 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 mu mol m(-2) d(-1). These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored.

AB  - Net ecosystem carbon dioxide (FCO2) and methane (FCH4) exchanges were measured by using the eddy covariance method to quantify the atmospheric carbon budget at a Typha- and Nymphaea-dominated freshwater marsh (March 2011 to March 2013) and a soybean cropland (May 2011 to May 2012) in northwestern Ohio, USA. Two year average annual FCH4 (49.7 g C-CH4 m-2yr-1) from the marsh was high and compatible with its net annual CO2 uptake (FCO2: -21.0 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1). In contrast, FCH4 was small (2.3 g C-CH4 m-2yr-1) and accounted for a minor portion of the atmospheric carbon budget (FCO2: -151.8 g C-CO2 m-2yr-1) at the cropland. At the seasonal scale, soil temperature associated with methane (CH4) production provided the dominant regulator of FCH4 at the marsh (R2=0.86). At the diurnal scale, plant-modulated gas flow was the major pathway for CH4 outgassing in the growing season at the marsh. Diffusion and ebullition became the major pathways in the nongrowing season and were regulated by friction velocity. Our findings highlight the importance of freshwater marshes for their efficiency in turning over and releasing newly fixed carbon as CH4. Despite marshes accounting for only similar to 4% of area in the agriculture-dominated landscape, their high FCH4 should be carefully addressed in the regional carbon budget.

AB  - This paper investigates the mobility and fluxes of REE, Y and Sc under weathering conditions from an anomalously metal-rich phosphogypsum stack in SW Spain. The interactions of the phosphogypsum stack with rainfall and organic matter-rich solutions, simulating the weathering processes observed due to its location on salt-marshes, were simulated by leaching tests (e.g. EN 12457-2 and TCLP). Despite the high concentration of REE, Y and Sc contained in the phosphogypsum stack, their mobility during the leaching tests was very low; <0.66% and 1.8% of the total content of these elements were released during both tests. Chemical and mineralogical evidences suggest that phosphate minerals may act as sources of REE and Y in the phosphogypsum stack while fluoride minerals may act as sinks, controlling their mobility. REE fractionation processes were identified in the phosphogypsum stack; a depletion of LREE in the saturated zone was identified due probably to the dissolution of secondary LREE phosphates previously formed during apatite dissolution in the industrial process. Thus, the vadose zone of the stack would preserve the original REE signature of phosphate rocks. On the other hand, an enrichment of MREE in relation to HREE of edge outflows is observed due to the higher influence of estuarine waters on the leaching process of the phosphogypsum stack. Despite the low mobility of REE, Y and Sc in the phosphogypsum, around 104 kg/yr of REE and 40 kg/yr of Y and Sc are released from the stack to the estuary, which may imply an environmental concern. The information obtained in this study could be used to optimize extraction methods aimed to recover REE, Y and Sc from phosphogypsum, mitigating the pollution to the environment.

AB  - Microbial communities play key roles in remediation and reclamation of contaminated environments via biogeochemical cycling of organic and inorganic components. Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

AB  - Intertidal wetlands capture and store carbon (C) for long periods of time, helping to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Yet the processes, which govern the decomposition and subsequent long-term storage of organic matter (OM) and C in these habitats, remain poorly understood. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) uses a standardized OM (green and Rooibos tea) and has the potential to shed light on OM decomposition across habitats, including saltmarshes. Here, we apply the TBI method at two saltmarshes within the same estuary with the aim of (i) reducing the influence of climatic variables and (ii) determining the role of the environment, including the soil characteristics, in the decomposition of OM. We extended the standard (3 months) incubation period over a full year in order to investigate the longer-term decomposition processes at each site. The initial results partially support previous studies that the early stages of decomposition (leaching of the water-soluble fraction) is governed by climatic conditions, but may be further enhanced by tidal flushing in saltmarshes. By extending the incubation period, we observed the initiation of midstage OM decomposition (cellulose degradation) upon which the soil characteristics appear to be the dominant control. These results highlight the importance of long-term TBI incubations to understand early-stage OM decomposition. The relationship between tea mass (OM) loss and C loss in these intertidal environments is not straightforward, and we would caution the use of the TBI as a direct universal proxy for soil C degradation in such intertidal wetlands.

AB  - In order to further elucidate the early diagenetic behavior of Mo, we examined the redox speciation of dissolved Mo in organic rich sediment from a back-barrier salt marsh environment in eastern Long Island (Flax Pond, NY). Total dissolved Mo (Sigma Mo) was similar to 80 nM in surface nonsulfidic porewater, dominantly as Mo (VI). Sigma Mo increased up to 150 nM at a depth of 3.5 cm with low sulfide content (Sigma H2S: 25-100 mu M), and Mo (V) reached 20 nM. Sigma Mo decreased to similar to 70 nM at a depth of 7.5 cm in highly sulfidic deep sediment porewater (Sigma H2S: > 100 mu M) with Mo(V) accounting for similar to 10%. Mo(VI) dominated residual Sigma Mo, likely as MoS42-. Averaged in situ Mo speciation patterns are complicated by mixed redox conditions created by biogenic structures and reworking. Serial anoxic incubation of surface sediments revealed reductive redox reaction progression without complications from transport and biogenic microenvironments: Mo(VI) dominated initially, followed by increases in Sigma Mo (dMo/dt similar to 7 nM/h) and production of Mo(V) under low sulfide conditions (Sigma H2S: 25-100 mu M; Mo(V) as high as 160 nM). Mo(V) was subsequently lost rapidly from solution (dMo(V)/dt similar to-5 nM/h) and residual Sigma Mo, presumably a mixture of Mo(VI) and a small percentage of Mo(IV), was gradually reestablished under highly sulfidic conditions (Sigma H2S > 100 mu M). Mo(V) is clearly produced as a transient dissolved intermediate during reductive redox reaction succession. Mo(V) may react with particles or disproportionate in the presence of polysulfides into Mo(IV), which likely rapidly adsorbs-precipitates as pyritic Mo-Fe-S, sulfidized organic complexes, or perhaps MoS2. Mo(VI), which remains, at least temporarily in solution as thiomolybdate is removed more slowly. In contrast to reductive reactions, reoxidation of reduced sediment results in rapid release of Mo dominated by Mo(VI). Dynamic diagenetic cycling and the existence of Mo(V) as a dissolved reaction intermediate must be accounted for in models of Mo fixation and associated isotopic fractionation in sulfidic deposits.

AB  - The subsurface of a tidal-flat sediment was analyzed down to 360 cm in depth by molecular and geochemical methods. A community structure analysis of all three domains of life was pet-formed using domain-specific PCR followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis and sequencing of characteristic bands. The sediment column comprised horizons easily distinguishable by lithology that were deposited in intertidal and salt marsh environments. The pore water profile was characterized by a subsurface sulfate peak at a depth of about 250 cm. Methane and sulfate profiles were opposed, showing increased methane concentrations in the sulfate-free layers. The availability of organic carbon appeared to have the most pronounced effect on the bacterial community composition in deeper sediment layers. In general, the bacterial community was dominated by fermenters and syntrophic bacteria. The depth distribution of methanogenic archaea correlated with the sulfate profile and could be explained by electron donor competition with sulfate-reducing bacteria. Sequences affiliated with the typically hydrogenotrophic Methanoinicrobiales were present in sulfate-free layers. Archaea belonging to the Methanosarcinales that utilize noncompetitive substrates were found along the entire anoxic-sediment column. Primers targeting the eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene revealed the presence of a subset of archaeal sequences in the deeper part of the sediment cores. The phylogenetic distance to other archaeal sequences indicates that these organisms represent a new phylogenetic group, proposed as "tidal-flat cluster 1." Eukarya were still detectable at 360 cm, even though their diversity decreased with depth. Most of the eukaryotic sequences were distantly related to those of grazers and deposit feeders.

AB  - Permanent freshwater and brackish marshes are the typical wetland type of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Historically, alterations to the original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (similar to 950g m(-2) yr(-1)), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and restoration for C exchange. Specifically, a highly altered site showed increased rates of aerobic respiration compared to undisturbed sites, with a decrease in C storage capacity to similar to 50g m(-2) yr(-1). Management practices resulting in instability of the organic sediments favoured degradative metabolism, with release of stored C and concomitant increases in CH4 emissions. Our results indicate that the hydromorphological alterations in these sites may convert healthy ecosystems contributing to C sequestration and climate change mitigation into C-emitting ecosystems.

AB  - Soils and porewater of the rhizosphere of mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leech., of the salt marsh grass Spartina alterniflora Loisel, and of unvegetated mud flats, were analyzed for pH, salinity, platinum electrode redox potential, organic matter content, sulfide concentrations, and the total and exchangeable concentrations of trace metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd). The study was conducted in a fringe mangrove forest in Sepetiba Bay, Rio de janeiro, Brazil. The rhizospheres differed in their biogeochemistry. Mud flats and Rhizophora soils were very reducing, with highest concentrations of sulfide. Avicennia soils showed the highest variability of the variables measured, with the rhizosphere changing from oxic to anoxic conditions. Spartina soils, on the other hand, were generally oxic, with very low sulfide concentration.
   The distribution of trace metals in these soils varied with the major physical and chemical characteristics. Mud flat soils presented the highest total trace metal concentrations followed by mangrove soils and Spartina soils. However, exchangeable trace metals were similar among the different soils with the exception of Avicennia soils, which due to their characteristic instability of redox conditions, presented much higher exchangeable trace metals concentrations.

AB  - The intertidal crabs Neohelice granulata and Cyrtograpsus angulatus are common on the south-west Atlantic coast but they rarely share the same microhabitat. They are similar in size and in several life history traits which promote competition. Neohelice granulata is the dominant species in intertidal soft-sediment and salt-marsh areas from southern Brazil to northern Patagonia Argentina, where it forms extensive burrowing beds. Its burrowing activity affects sediment characteristics as well as the infaunal community. When both species coexist N. granulata constrains the distribution and modifies some population characteristics and burrowing behaviour of C. angulatus. However, C. angulatus live in burrows forming dense burrowing beds in soft-bottom intertidal areas where N. granulata is absent. Where both species coexist, C. angulatus rarely constructs burrows and N. granulata clearly dominate soft-sediment areas forming conspicuous burrowing beds. This suggests that these crab species could have similar ecological roles in some effects on sediments related to burrowing activities. In this study, we experimentally compare their effects on sediment characteristics and infaunal community. The results of the experiment showed that C. angulatus modify sediment water and organic matter contents and grain size-frequency distributions similarly to N. granulata. Neither N. granulata nor C. angulatus affected the mean abundance of infaunal organisms during the experiment but their variances showed the same patterns in many cases, indicating similar effects. These results indicate that C. angulatus can modify sediment characteristics similarly to N. granulata, and has similar interactions with infaunal species.

AB  - We surveyed 34 marshes in relatively pristine Precambrian Shield catchments in Georgian Bay and related water chemistry to a suite of landscape-level variables, including characteristics of the marsh and its drainage basin. The first landscape principal component (explained 48% of variation) ordered marshes along a gradient with high values corresponding to marshes with large watersheds that contain extensive upstream wetland and that receive relatively high precipitation inputs. This axis was negatively related to specific conductivity, pH, nitrate nitrogen, and SO42- concentrations and positively related to total phosphorus, colour, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, and summer dissolved organic carbon. Stepwise regression models built using catchment- and marsh-level variables explained up to 64% of the variation in water chemistry variables. Average precipitation and snowmelt inputs to the catchments were first to enter the majority of models, alone explaining up to 43% of the variation (in the case of water colour), while drainage area alone explained 44% of the variation in pH. Concentrations of catchment-derived constituents in marshes were highest in spring, reflecting greater loadings from the watersheds, while ionic strength was highest during summer, reflecting increased contributions form other sources (i.e., lake water).

AB  - Water column concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were measured at three different depths in four different locations bracketing the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) along the main channel of a temperate riverine estuary (Winyah Bay, South Carolina, USA). Measurements were carried out over full tidal cycle (over 24 h). Salinity, temperature, current magnitude and direction were also monitored at the same time throughout the water column. Tidally averaged net fluxes of salt, TSS, POC and PN were calculated by combining the current measurements with the concentration data. Under the extreme low river discharge conditions that characterized the study period, net landward fluxes of salt were measured in the lower part of the study area, suggesting that the landward transport through the main channel of the estuary was probably balanced by export out through the sides. In contrast, the net fluxes of salt in the upper reaches of the study area were near zero. indicatina a closed salt balance in this part of the estuary. In contrast to salt, the net fluxes of TSS, POC and PN in the deeper parts of the water column were consistently landward at all four sites in Winyah Bay indicating the non-conservative behavior of particulate components and their active transport up the estuary in the region around the ETM.
   The carbon contents (%POC), carbomnitrogen ratios (org[C:N]a) and stable carbon isotopic compositions (delta(13)C(POC)) of the suspended particles varied significantly with depth, location and tidal stage. Tidally averaged compositions showed a significant increase up the estuary in the %POC and org[C:N]a values of suspended particles consistent with the preferential landward transport of carbon-rich particles with higher vascular plant debris content. The combination of tidal resuspension and flooddominated flow appeared to be responsible for the hydrodynamic sorting of particles along the estuary that resulted in denser, organic-poor particles being transported landward less efficiently. The elemental and isotopic compositions indicated that vascular C-3 plants and estuarine algae were the major sources of the particulate organic matter of all the samples, without any significant contributions front salt marsh C-4 vegetation (Spartina alternWora) and/or marine phytoplankton.

AB  - Examination of surface-associated protozoa in Great Lakes coastal marshes has been minimal, although they play crucial roles in nutrient and energy transfer in similar systems. Spatio-temporal patterns of artificial substrate-associated protist and bacterial abundances are related to physicochemical conditions at this ''freshwater estuary.'' Assemblages were sampled monthly (May-October) at upstream, downstream and at two mid-estuarine sites. A total of 278 protistan taxa were observed, and greatest richness occur red in late June. Richness at the estuary mouth was consistently higher than npstream, possibly due to the influence of Lake Erie assemblages and variability in hydrology-driven habitat characteristics. PCA yielded two components accounting for 90% of total variance in species by sites data. Species abundances at the two mid-estuarine sites were most highly correlated, and taxa seasonally abundant at any one site tended to be abundant at others. Presence/absence data were wed to calculate community similarity indices, and a permutation-computed test statistic compared the mean similarity of triplicate substrates in one month (at a given site) to the between-month similarity. Significant differences (alpha = 0.05) between some months (site by site) were observed with a unique assemblage noted in October. Following classification into six functional feeding groups, bactivores (mainly heterotrophic microflagellates) and primary producers (mainly cryptomonads and chlamydomonads) dominated assemblages. Organisms in other functional groups comprised only 10-15% of observed taxa. A preponderance of bactivorous taxa is consistent with observations of a dense and metabolically active bacterial community associated with abundant particulate organic matter in easily resuspended surficial sediments.

AB  - Coastal environments with reducing waters and/or sediments represent potential sinks for Tc-99 discharged to sea. Here, we have examined estuarine sediments from four geochemically distinct locations that have been exposed to Tc-99 discharged from Sellafield. Both the relative uptake and the operationally defined sediment "component" that holds the Tc were investigated in order to establish whether particular biogeochemical processes are predominately responsible for reducing and binding Tc in sediments. Despite the artefacts that can pose problems for sequential extractions, this scheme [Int. J. Environ. Anal. Chem. 51 (1993) 1871 appears to be robust with regard to Tc. The results show that relative uptake of Tc varied greatly between the sites, with the highest occurring at an almost permanently anoxic fjord (Mariager Fjord, Denmark), followed by a brackish, seasonally eutrophic fjord (Roskilde Fjord, Denmark), then a sub-oxic salt marsh (which receives particle bound radionuclides from a more reducing mud patch; Esk Estuary, UK) and finally sulfidic and iron-reducing muddy sandy sediments (Needle's Eye, Solway Firth, Scotland). High relative uptake at the fjords was explained by the greater mixing of Tc-labelled oxic seawater into the part of the system where reduction of TcO4- was possible. Uptake at Mariager Fjord was higher than at Roskilde Fjord, reflecting the highly reducing geochemical conditions in the water body. Low uptake at Needle's Eye may be related to the speciation of technetium at this site as the sequential extraction data suggest that Tc is associated with the carbonate phase here. Tc carbonates are largely soluble, and this is the first observation of Tc association with carbonate fractions in the natural environment. The other three sites showed that organic matter, in conjunction with reducing conditions, was very important for binding and retaining Tc in sediments. The specific role of sulfides in controlling Tc retention in sediments was unclear because sulfides and organic matter are leached simultaneously in the sequential extraction scheme we applied, but there was evidence that Tc was not associated with acid-volatile iron monosulfides.

AB  - This work aimed to test the suitability of pyrite (FeS2) as a proxy for reconstructing past marine environmental conditions along the semiarid coast of Brazil. Morphological description combined with physicochemical analyses including Fe partitioning were conducted for soil depth profiles (30 and 60 cm depths) at three sites in two contrasting lagoons of the state of Ceara: a suspected former lagoon that would have been transformed into a freshwater "lake" at a site vegetated by Juncus effusus (site P1), and another lagoon with connection to the sea at sites vegetated by J. effusus (site P2) or Portulaca oleracea (site P3). Soil samples were collected in September 2010. Site P3 had more reducing conditions, reaching Eh values of -132 mV in the surface layer (0-10 cm), whereas minimum values for the P1 and P2 sites were +219 and +85 mV, respectively. Lower pyritic Fe values were found at site P1, with a degree of pyritization (DOP) ranging from 10 to 13%. At sites P2 and P3, DOP ranged from 9 to 67% and from 55 to 72%, respectively. These results are consistent with an interruption of tidal channels by eolian dune migration inducing strong changes in the hydrodynamics and physicochemical characteristics (lower salinity, oxidizing conditions) of these sites, causing the dieback of suspected former mangroves and a succession to freshwater marshes with an intermediate salt marsh stage. Together with other physicochemical signatures, pyrite can evidently serve as a useful proxy in tracking environmental changes in such ecotones, with implications for coastal management.

AB  - Salt marshes are important hotspots of long-term belowground carbon (C) storage, where plant biomass and allochthonous C can be preserved in the soil for thousands of years. However, C accumulation rates, as well as the sources of C, may differ depending on environmental conditions influencing plant productivity, allochthonous C deposition, and C preservation. For this study, we examined the relationship between belowground root growth, turnover, decay, above-and belowground biomass, and previously reported longer-term rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation and accretion in Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes across two mid-Atlantic, US estuaries. Tidal range, long-term rates of mineral sedimentation, C accumulation, and accretion were higher and salinities were lower in marshes of the coastal plain estuary (Delaware Bay) than in the coastal lagoon (Barnegat Bay). We expected that the conditions promoting high rates of C accumulation would also promote high plant productivity and greater biomass. We further tested the influence of environmental conditions on belowground growth (roots C rhizomes), decomposition, and biomass of S. alterniflora. The relationship between plant biomass and C accumulation rate differed between estuaries. In the sediment-limited coastal lagoon, rates of total, labile, and refractory organic C accumulation were directly and positively related to above-and belowground biomass. Here, less flooding and a higher mineral sedimentation rate promoted greater above-and belowground biomass and, in turn, higher soil C accumulation and accretion rates. In the coastal plain estuary, the C accumulation rate was related only to above-ground biomass, which was positively related to the rate of labile C accumulation. Soil profiles indicated that live root and rhizome biomass was positively associated with labile C density for most marshes, yet high labile C densities below the live root zone and in marshes with high mineral sedimentation rates and low biomass signify the potential contribution of allochthonous C and the preservation of labile C. Overall, our findings illustrate the importance of sediment supply to marshes both for promoting positive plant C accumulation-accretion feedbacks in geomorphic settings where mineral sediment is limiting and for promoting allochthonous inputs and preservation of labile C leading to high C accumulation and accretion rates in geomorphic settings where sediment supply is abundant.

AB  - Estuaries are renown sinks or repositories of contaminants and reflect historical pollution of persistent compounds. In particular, mercury (Hg) contamination is widespread in coastal environments and occurs in both inorganic (THg) and highly toxic organic forms (OHg) with high bioaccumulation potential. Trophic magnification factors have been increasingly used to quantify biomagnification and represent the average rate of change in contaminant concentration throughout a food web. Here, we assessed small-scale spatial variation in THg and OHg concentrations, as well as variations in local trophic magnification factors in three segregated areas of the Tejo estuary. Selected sites covered a gradient of contamination from industrial Hg hotspots to a natural reserve area, and are key nursery areas for multiple fishes. We analyzed concentrations in sediment and biota, representing the entire local food webs. Samples included sediments, primary producers (salt marsh plants), primary consumers (macrobenthic invertebrates) and top consumers (fish muscle and liver), and the trophic web structure was characterized via SIAR mixed-modeling of nitrogen and carbon isotopic ratios. Spatial variation in Hg concentrations was observed in sediment and biota (but not for all species), with highest concentrations in the area near historical mercury input. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, and so did the OHg fraction (% of OHg relative to THg), with mean maximum values up to 48.7 and 94.9% in invertebrates and fish, respectively. Trophic magnification factors were positive for all sites (p < 0.05 for all regressions), ranging between 1.56 to 1.76 and 1.78 to 2.47 for THg and OHg, respectively. Overall, rates of mercury bioaccumulation were similar across sites with variations in biota Hg concentrations reflecting baseline differences in site environmental levels. Understanding mercury bioaccumulation and magnification in estuarine biota is critical to safeguard the multiple ecologic functions and economic benefits estuaries provide.

AB  - Manganese(iv) oxide (pyrolusite, birnessite) mineral amendments can reduce dissolved MeHg concentrations in sediment theoretically by inhibiting microbial sulfate reduction, which is a major methylation pathway in sediments. Anaerobic sediment slurry microcosms in which Hg methylation was stimulated by addition of labile organic carbon (acetate) and HgCl2 showed that manganese(iv) oxide reduced the percent MeHg in slurry porewater (filtered), by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to controls. Sediment-water mesocosms with pyrolusite or birnessite either directly mixed into the top 5 cm or applied in a thin (5 cm) sand layer over sediment showed reductions in percent MeHg in porewater of 66-69% for pyrolusite and 81-89% for birnessite amendment. A thin sand layer alone resulted in 65% reduction. CO2 respirometry experiments showed that the amendments stimulated microbial activity. Microbial community census by PCR and DNA sequencing indicated that the addition of Mn(iv) oxides did not significantly alter the indigenous sediment microbial community structure, although a small increase in abundance of iron and manganese reducers was observed after a 2 week incubation period. The mechanism of decreasing MeHg relative to Hg concentrations in porewater likely involved an increase in the importance of Mn(iv) reduction (relative to sulfate reduction) in heterotrophic microbial metabolism in the sediments amended with Mn(iv) oxides. Manganese reduction was confirmed as the predominant biogeochemical redox process by microelectrode voltammetry profiling of the sediment microcosms, although adsorption to Mn oxide surfaces, enhanced MeHg demethylation, and abiotic reduction of Mn(iv) also may have been involved in reducing percent MeHg and suppressing net MeHg production. These results represent a novel approach for mitigating MeHg impacts from sediments with potential applicability to a range of aquatic settings including intertidal zones, tidal marshes, seasonal wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes.

AB  - Humic substances, which are randomly cross-linked heterogeneous organic materials of high molecular weight, comprise a major fraction of the organic matter in soils and sediments. Because humic substances have a variety of functional groups, they play a major role in controlling the physical and chemical characteristics of natural waters, soils, and sediments. Sedimentary humic substances are considered to be the precursors of petroleum-forming kerogens. Sulfur is thought to play a major role in forming humic substances in anoxic marine sediments. Because of their structural heterogeneity, humic substances are not easily amenable to biochemical degradation and, thus, are generally considered to be biologically refractory. The complexity and heterogeneity of humic substances render;the elucidation of their chemical structure a major analytical challenge. Degradative techniques, such as pyrolysis GC-MS, can change a sample's structure during preparation and analysis and, thus, may give inaccurate. information. In this study, we investigated the sulfur-containing functional groups in humic acids from various marine sediments using XANES spectroscopy which has proved to be an important, nondestructive tool for analyzing sulfur forms. Humic acids were isolated from near-surface sediments from three locations: a salt marsh in Shelter Island, NY; the Peru Margin; and Florida Bay. We found that organic sulfides, di- and polysulfides, sulfonates, and organic sulfates are the major forms of sulfur in these sedimentary humics. The reduced-sulfur structures, organic sulfides, and di- and polysulfides, are essentially intramolecular as apposed to the highly oxidized forms of sulfur, sulfonates, and ester-bonded sulfates, which can only be present as end groups. The abundance of the reduced-sulfur structures reflects the extent to which sulfur is involved in forming intramolecular cross-links which are crucial for building up the macromolecular structures of humic substances. The significance of the presence of the different sulfur functionalities in humic substances is discussed in relation re, early diagenesis and preservation of organic matter in marine sediments.

AB  - Long-term soil chronosequences are valuable model systems for investigating pedogenesis and investigating the process of element coupling. Here, we assessed the coupling relationships among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria (Anaeromyxobacter, Geobacter, and Shewanella) in a paddy soil chronosequence of approximately 50 to 1000years. Soils of the chronosequence originated from tidal marsh under nearly identical landscape and climate conditions. During 1000years of rice cultivation, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in surface horizons (0-20cm) increased from 10.4 to 21.8gkg(-1). In contrast, total Fe contents declined from 59.6 to 45.1gkg(-1) during the initial 50years of paddy rice cultivation and then further decreased at a low rate of 0.004gkg(-1) soil year(-1) (equivalent to 10kgha(-1) soil year(-1)). Organically complexed Fe oxides (Fe-p) increased from 219 to 642mgg(-1) with increasing time of pedogenesis, but free total Fe oxides (Fe-d) and amorphous Fe oxides (Fe-o) declined at early stage of soil development, followed by a slow accumulation at later stages of the chronosequence. Gene copy numbers of Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter increased from 4.6x10(5) and 3.6x10(6) copies g(-1) to 3.8x10(7) and 3.6x10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil with continuous paddy rice cultivation, while concurrently Shewanella gene abundance decreased gradually from 4.5x10(5) to 9.3x10(4) copies g(-1) dry soil. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), different coupling relationships were observed among C, Fe, and Fe-reducing bacteria for the first 300years of paddy chronosequence and thereafter. Overall, all Fe-reducing bacteria did not show consistent variation. With the stable microbial community and iron oxide fractions, the microbially mediated dissimilatory coupling relationship between C and Fe becomes simple during 1000years of paddy soil development.

AB  - The diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) in three different depositional environments in south Texas and dominated by vascular plant input was investigated. Sediments were collected from McGuill Lake, a small freshwater lake, and two salt marsh sites in Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, and size-fractioned by wet sieving. Physical forcing or energy, indicated by tides, tidal current, and wind and wind fetch area, is weakest in the lake, intermediate strength at the Nueces Delta, and strongest at Copano Bay. Results from total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA) and n-alkane analysis, and C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) showed that the SOM from all three sites became more degraded towards finer size fractions, from > 300 mu m, 300-125 mu m, 125-63 mu m, 63-32 mu m to < 32 mu m. Relative to the coarse fractions, the fine fractions were enriched in the degradation indicator gamma-aminobutyric acid, and in aliphatic and proteinaceous components, as shown from NMR spectra and lower C/N ratio values. This degradation pattern of SOM with size is typical for sediments from coastal and lacustrine environments. However, the contents of organic carbon (OC), THAAs and n-alkanes were higher in sandy fractions than in silt and clay fractions from McGuill Lake sediment, suggesting that the SOM was relatively undegraded in coarse fractions. The size distribution of OM in the lake could be explained by the weak physical forcing, which may not easily break down coarser plant detritus into smaller pieces. The trend contrasted with degradation patterns for sediments from Nueces Delta and Copano Bay, where SOM was concentrated in the < 32 mu m fraction, which may be due to the strong physical forcing. The physical forcing effects could also explain the attachment of clay minerals to sand grains in both the lake and Nueces Delta because of the relatively weak physical forcing effects, while no clay attachment to sand grains was found at the Copano Bay site because of the strong physical forcing effects. Physical forcing may be an important mechanism in the processing and transport of OM from vascular plants and other organic sources in estuaries and bays before the SOM is exported to coastal oceans.

AB  - Invasive plants in wetlands may alter community composition through complex interactions related to elevated N inflows, plant size, litter production, and ecosystem N retention and recycling. To investigate these interactions, we constructed an individual-based model, MONDRIAN, that integrates individual growth and clonal reproduction, nutrient competitive interactions among species, and ecosystem processes. We conducted in silico experiments, parameterized for Great Lakes coastal marshes, where invaders that differed only in size attempted to invade native communities across a range of N inflows. Small invaders were able to persist only at low N inflow and never dominated. Large invaders were not able to reproduce clonally at low N inflow but they successfully coexisted with natives at intermediate N inflow and dominated at high N inflow, excluding natives in some cases. In both native and invaded communities, a positive feedback in plant-detritus N cycling emerged, amplifying ecosystem N cycling to nearly 2x the range of N inflows. The largest invaders augmented this N-cycling feedback over the native community by up to 23%, increasing with greater N inflow, driving community NPP higher than the native community by 33% and litter mass higher by 35%. In communities dominated by the largest invader, wetland N retention was increased but species diversity decreased. Results demonstrate that a single trait difference, plant size, simultaneously allows natives to resist invasion at low N inflows and allows invaders to dominate at high N inflows, partly through augmenting ecosystem N-cycling feedbacks.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from sediments and water of a saltmarsh lagoon on the west coast of South Africa, and characterized according to factors that regulate nitrogen fixation in the marine environment. The majority of isolates were assigned to the Photobacterium or Vibrio genera on the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics. One isolate was further assigned to the species Vibrio diazotrophicus. Carbohydrate utilization by each diazotrophic isolate was examined. Abilities of the isolates to utilize a range of mono-, di-, and polysaccharides largely reflected the predicted availability of organic carbon and energy in the lagoon, except that chitin was not utilized. Biochemical tests on the utilization of combined nitrogen showed that one isolate could utilize nitrate, and that this strain was susceptible to full repression of nitrogenase activity by 10 mM nitrate. Urease activity was not detected in any of the isolates. In the absence of molybdenum two of the isolates, a Photobacterium spp. and V. diazotrophicus, reduced acetylene to ethylene and ethane, a property frequently associated with the activity of alternative nitrogenases. Addition of 25 mu M molybdenum inhibited ethane production by V. diazotrophicus, but stimulated ethylene and ethane production by the Photobacterium isolate. Addition of 28 mu M vanadium did not appear to regulate ethane production by either strain. Assays of nitrogenase activity in sediments from which some isolates were obtained indicated that molybdenum was not limiting nitrogenase activity at naturally-occurring concentrations. Southern hybridizations of the chromosomes of these strains with the anfH and vnfH genes of Azotobacter vinelandii and the nifH gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae indicated the presence of only one nitrogenase in these isolates.

AB  - Suaeda salsa is a pioneer species in coastal wetlands of East Asia and recently an ecosystem engineer species, Phragmites australis, has started to enter into S. salsa communities owing to either autogenic or external drivers. The consequences of this phenomenon on the ecosystem functions of coastal wetlands are still unclear, especially for decomposition processes. Here we compared the decomposition rate of S. salsa litter, and associated litter chemistry dynamics, between sites with and without P. australis encroachment. We conducted a litter transplantation experiment to tease apart the effects of litter quality and decomposing environment or decomposer community composition. Our results showed that P. australis encroachment led to higher carbon and phosphorus losses of S. salsa litter, but equal losses of total mass, lignin, hemicellulose and nitrogen. Phragmites australis encroachment might affect decomposition rate indirectly by making S. salsa produce litter with higher lignin concentrations or via increasing the fungal diversity for decomposition. Moreover, P. australis as an ecosystem engineer might also alter the allocation of total phosphorus between the plants and the soils in coastal wetlands. Our findings indicate that P. australis could impact aboveground and belowground carbon and nutrient dynamics in coastal wetlands, and highlight the important consequences that encroaching plant species, especially ecosystem engineers, can have on ecosystem functions and services of coastal wetlands, not only in East Asia but probably also elsewhere in the world.

AB  - Wetland dynamic in the northern Brazilian Amazon region during the Holocene was reviewed using palynological, carbon and nitrogen isotopes records, and C/N ratio previously published. The integration of 72 radiocarbon dates recorded in 34 sediment cores sampled along the marine and fluvial littoral, and mainly influenced by the Amazon River, reveals that marine influence and mangrove vegetation were wider than today on the mouth of Amazon River between >8990-8690 and 2300-2230 cal yr BP, forming a continuous mangrove belt along the northern Brazilian Amazon littoral. The establishment of this mangrove strip is a direct consequence of the marine incursion caused by post-glacial sea-level rise possibly associated with tectonic subsidence during the Early and Middle Holocene. In the Late Holocene, in areas influenced by the Amazon River discharge, the mangroves were replaced by freshwater vegetation, and the coast morphology evolved from an estuarine dominated into a rectilinear coast due to coastal progradation. Nevertheless, the marine-influenced littoral, which is currently dominated by mangroves and salt-marsh vegetation, has persistently had brackish water vegetation over tidal mud flats throughout the entire Holocene. Likely, the fragmentation of this continuous mangrove line during the Late Holocene was caused by the increase of river freshwater discharge associated to the change from dry into wet climates in the Late Holocene. This caused a significant decrease of tidal water salinity in areas near the mouth of Amazon River. These changes in the Amazon discharge are probably associated with dry and wet periods in the northern Amazon region during the Holocene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Core NYS-101, which was recovered at a water depth of 49 m northeast of the Shandong Peninsula in the North Yellow Sea, penetrates the Holocene subaqueous clinoform that wraps around the Shandong Peninsula. The uppermost 18 m of this well-dated core was deposited after about 13 cal kyr BP during the post-glacial transgression. We focused on trace and rare earth element (REE) chemistries of the core sediments in the uppermost 18 m to investigate the sediment provenance and factors controlling the sediment composition. On the basis of down-core distributions of REE fractionation parameters and of ratios among REEs and other immobile elements, we divided the uppermost 18 m into three distinct compositional intervals: Interval 1 (above 6.08 m, from the time tens of years earlier than 6500 cal yr BP up to the present), Interval 2 (13.90-6.08 m, from about 8200 cal yr BP to the boundary between Intervals 1 and 2), and Interval 3 (below 13.90 m, from about 13,000 to 10,400 cal yr BP). The chondrite-and upper continental crust (UCC)-normalized REE fractionation patterns of Intervals 3 and 2 are similar to those of Yellow River sediments, but the patterns in Interval 1 are obviously different.
   Results of a geochemical discrimination analysis suggest that the sediments of Interval 2 were transported mainly from the Yellow River by the strong coastal current along the Shandong Peninsula, whereas those of Interval I were derived in part from rivers of the Korean Peninsula and the Yangtze River as well as from Yellow River sediments. The sediments of Interval 3 were largely derived from the Yellow River, but local rivers of the Shandong Peninsula contributed minor sediments to the interval, which was deposited in salt-marsh, coastal plain, and subtidal nearshore environments during the early post-glacial transgression. We attribute the change in sediment composition between Intervals 1 and 2 to a dramatic mid-Holocene adjustment of oceanic circulation in the Yellow Sea and adjacent areas, when sediments primarily from the rivers of the Korean Peninsula and the Yangtze River began to be transported to the coasts of the Shandong Peninsula.

AB  - Our goal was to quantify the coupled process of litter turnover and leaching as a source of nutrients and fixed carbon in oligotrophic, nutrient-limited wetlands. We conducted poisoned and non-poisoned incubations of leaf material from four different perennial wetland plants (Eleocharis spp., Cladium jamaicense, Rhizophora mangle and Spartina alterniflora) collected from different oligotrophic freshwater and estuarine wetland settings. Total phosphorus (TP) release from the P-limited Everglades plant species (Eleocharis spp., C. jamaicense and R. mangle) was much lower than TP release by the salt marsh plant S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet (SC). For most species and sampling times, total organic carbon (TOC) and TP leaching losses were much greater in poisoned than non-poisoned treatments, likely as a result of epiphytic microbial activity. Therefore, a substantial portion of the C and P leached from these wetland plant species was bio-available to microbial communities. Even the microbes associated with S. alterniflora from N-limited North Inlet showed indications of P-limitation early in the leaching process, as P was removed from the water column. Leaves of R. mangle released much more TOC per gram of litter than the other species, likely contributing to the greater waterborne [DOC] observed by others in the mangrove ecotone of Everglades National Park. Between the two freshwater Everglades plants, C. jamaicense leached nearly twice as much P than Eleocharis spp. In scaling this to the landscape level, our observed leaching losses combined with higher litter production of C. jamaicense compared to Eleocharis spp. resulted in a substantially greater P leaching from plant litter to the water column and epiphytic microbes. In conclusion, leaching of fresh plant litter can be an important autochthonous source of nutrients in freshwater and estuarine wetland ecosystems.

AB  - In the litter-soil compartment, soil fauna plays an important role in nutrient availability for plants, since it regulates the microbial community involved with organic matter decomposition and fragmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the richness and abundance of soil fauna as well as its vertical distribution on a periodically flooded sandbank area ("restinga") in Marambaia Island - RJ, in two season (summer - rainy and winter-dry). Litter and soil was sampled (0-5 cm), from which fauna was extracted by Berlese-Tullgren extractors. An increase in the abundance of soil fauna was observed from the dry to the rainy season, while the abundance of taxonomic groups was not modified. In both seasons, the most frequent groups were Formicidae and Collembola. Regarding the vertical distribution, the soil fauna preferred litter in the rainy and soil in the dry period. The microphagy and saprophagy represented the main forms of resource use, followed by predation, suggesting a sound structure of the habitat in the ecosystem. Moreover, the occurrence of groups that are found in undisturbed environments only, indicated that the ecosystem Restinga on the Island of Marambaia, at the time of evaluation (2002), was little or not degraded and well-conserved.

AB  - Knowledge of root: shoot ratio (R/S) is fundamental for our understanding of carbon allocation and storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the periodic variation of water table and the difficulty ofmeasuring belowground biomass (BGB), macrophyte biomass allocation in both coastal and inland wetlands remains unclear, especially at regional scale. In this study, 131 records of biomass allocation inwetlandswere collected to examine general pattern of macrophyte R/S in relation to climate, soil, and hydrological factors in China using model selection and variance decomposition analysis. Our results showed that coastal wetlands supported higher aboveground biomass (AGB, 3.1 kgm(-2)) but a lower R/S (1.2) than inland ones (1.47 kgm(-2) and 3.1, respectively). The positive relationships between AGB and BGB and between BGB and R/S in coastal wetlands were significantly different from those in inland wetlands, while only inland wetlands exhibited a significant negative correlation between R/S and AGB (R-2 = 0.19, p < 0.001). Among climate ( i.e., mean annual temperature and precipitation), soil (e.g., pH, salinity, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), and hydrological (water level and depth for coastal and inland wetlands, respectively) properties, the latter two groups explained 64% and 31% of spatial variation for inland and coastal R/S, respectively, compared with climate (2.7% and 1.5%, respectively). Specifically, soil salinity was the most important factor in regulating R/S for coastal wetlands, while, for inlandwetlands, itwas soil phosphorus. This study highlights the importance of hydrology, soil salinity and nutrients on wetland R/S and BGB estimation, which could be incorporated into wetland ecosystem models to improve prediction performance for carbon dynamics and their feedbacks to climate change in the future.

AB  - Terrestrial organic carbon (OC) preserved in marine sediments is an important reservoir in the global carbon cycle, but remains poorly constrained. We determined the elemental and C- and N-isotopic compositions of organic material (OM) in surface sediments and sediment cores from the Gulf of Trieste (N Adriatic), an area characterized by relatively high riverine input. This multiple tracer approach permits evaluation of how sensitive each tracer is for constraining the terrestrial component of OM. Using the relevant terrestrial and marine OM end-members, we estimate that the terrestrial contribution ranges from about 90% at the mouth of the Isonzo River and decreases to <= 10% in the center of the Gulf. In the southern part of the Gulf, 32-44% of terrestrial OC is contributed from smaller rivers, while the delta(15)N values of OM reflect more effective nutrient utilization. Analyses of different size fractions show that smaller particles are consistently more organic-rich and tend to be transported further from the river mouth, depending on river discharge. In the size fraction 2-16 mu m, elemental ratios and delta(13)C(org) and delta(15)N isotopic signatures are consistent with a sedimentary OM pool dominated by bacterially derived biomass. Radiocarbon analyses of sedimentary OC yield depleted Delta(14)C values (-338.7 parts per thousand to -429.4 parts per thousand), indicating a significant fraction of relatively old OC. The natural abundance of C-13 and C-14 tracers suggests a two-component mixture of ancient and modem C in the sediments down to approximately 60 cm sub-bottom, with an estimated similar to 45% of sedimentary OC probably being derived from ancient sedimentary OC (kerogen). In addition, there is a significant change in the source of organic material downcore in these sediments which, along with geological evidence, indicate contributions from freshwater swamps typical of coastal lakes with intermittent connections to the sea (brackish) prior to similar to 9000 BP. Depth variations in a core from a salt marsh further indicate temporal variability of OM deposition and transformations in a changing brackish-marine environment in the past. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change is altering sea level rise rates and precipitation patterns worldwide. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to these changes. System responses to stressors are important for resource managers and environmental stewards to understand in order to best manage them. Thin layer sand or sediment application to drowning and eroding marshes is one approach to build elevation and resilience. The above-and below-ground structure, soil carbon dioxide emissions, and pore water constituents in vegetated natural marsh sediments and sand-amended sediments were examined at varying inundation regimes between mean sea level and mean high water (0.82 m NAVD88 to 1.49 m NAVD88) in a field experiment at Laws Point, part of the Plum Island Sound Estuary (MA). Significantly lower salinities, pH, sulfides, phosphates, and ammonium were measured in the sand-amended sediments than in the natural sediments. In natural sediments there was a pattern of increasing salinity with increasing elevation while in the sand-amended sediments the trend was reversed, showing decreasing salinity with increasing elevation. Sulfide concentrations generally increased from low to high inundation with highest concentrations at the highest inundation (i. e., at the lowest elevations). High pore water phosphate concentrations were measured at low elevations in the natural sediments, but the sand-amended treatments had mostly low concentrations of phosphate and no consistent pattern with elevation. At the end of the experiment the lowest elevations generally had the highest measures of pore water ammonium. Soil carbon dioxide emissions were greatest in the sandamended mesocosms and at higher elevations. Differences in coarse root and rhizome abundances and volumes among the sediment treatments were detected with CT imaging, but by 20 weeks the natural and sand-amended treatments showed similar total belowground biomass at the intermediate and high elevations. Although differences in pore water nutrient concentrations, pH, salinity, and belowground root and rhizome morphology were detected between the natural and sand-amended sediments, similar belowground productivity and total biomass were measured by the end of the growing season. Since the belowground productivity supports organic matter accumulation and peat buildup in marshes, our results suggest that thin layer sand or sediment application is a viable climate adaptation action to build elevation and coastal resiliency, especially in areas with low natural sediment supplies.

AB  - Many global change drivers chronically alter resource availability in terrestrial ecosystems. Such resource alterations are known to affect aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the short term; however, it is unknown if patterns of response change through time. We examined the magnitude, direction, and pattern of ANPP responses to a wide range of global change drivers by compiling 73 datasets from long-term (> 5 years) experiments that varied by ecosystem type, length of manipulation, and the type of manipulation. Chronic resource alterations resulted in a significant change in ANPP irrespective of ecosystem type, the length of the experiment, and the resource manipulated. However, the pattern of ecosystem response over time varied with ecosystem type and manipulation length. Continuous directional responses were the most common pattern observed in herbaceous-dominated ecosystems. Continuous directional responses also were frequently observed in longer-term experiments (> 11 years) and were, in some cases, accompanied by large shifts in community composition. In contrast, stepped responses were common in forests and other ecosystems (salt marshes and dry valleys) and with nutrient manipulations. Our results suggest that the response of ANPP to chronic resource manipulations can be quite variable; however, responses persist once they occur, as few transient responses were observed. Shifts in plant community composition over time could be important determinants of patterns of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity, but comparative, long-term studies are required to understand how and why ecosystems differ in their sensitivity to chronic resource alterations.

AB  - To provide a new perspective on the fate of petroleum in the marine environment, we utilized variations in the natural abundance of radiocarbon (C-14) to detect and quantify petroleum residues that have persisted in Wild Harbor sediments, West Falmouth, MA, for more than 30 years. The 5730-yr half-life of 14C makes this isotope ideal for the detection of fossil-fuel-derived contaminants (C-14 free) within different fractions of natural organic matter (modern C-14 content) in environmental matrixes. Samples of both contaminated and uncontaminated sediments were sequentially treated, first by solvent extraction, followed by saponification, and then acid hydrolysis. Radiocarbon analysis of the sediment residues and select extracts was performed to probe for the presence of fossil fuel contaminants and/or their metabolites in different pools of sedimentary organic matter. Our results indicate that the majority of fossil carbon is solvent-extractable and has not been incorporated in the insoluble organic matter in sediment. Unextracted sediments contaminated with petroleum contain significantly less C-14 than extracted sediments, and isotope mass balance calculations suggest that up to similar to 9% of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the petroleum contaminated sediment horizons is derived from solvent-extractable petroleum. These estimates are similar to values calculated when the total quantities of oil (measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID)) are compared to TOC content (determined by elemental analysis). These results pave the way for applications of this isotopic approach to more complex environmental systems where the fate of contaminants is less certain.

AB  - Bull Island (BI) is a coastal sand spit that formed as an unintended consequence of the construction of two walls, built over 200 years ago in Dublin Port, Ireland to alleviate silting of the shipping route. A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon (SL) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon (NL) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats (MF) and vegetated saltmarshes (SM). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across BI's sediments, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon's (PAH's) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon. This study highlights the ability of a functioning coastal wetland to flourish and sequester elevated levels of carbon, metals and pollutants under the constraints of increasing anthropogenic impact. As the inadvertent result of geo-engineering, BI and its environs is a very important site to investigate the potential of artificially constructed wetlands to act as blue carbon reservoirs.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns of reproductive biology might provide predictions about fitness and population stability in different locations within the geographical range of a particular species. Leptuca uruguayensis is a fiddler crab that breeds year round in tropical estuaries but only in summer months in temperate salt marshes. In this study, we examined several reproductive attributes of the southernmost population of L. uruguayensis, including the proportion of ovigerous females, the proportion of surface-active crabs, the developmental status of the gonads and hepatopancreas, and the fullness of seminal receptacles, and related them to environmental factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and sediment organic matter content. We found that temperature was the environmental factor that was most correlated with the reproductive process of the southernmost fiddler crab, since this environmental factor was related to ovarian development, to the fullness of seminal receptacles, and to the hepatosomatic index. At the southern edge of its distribution, the low temperatures of winter restricted reproduction in L. uruguayensis. These winter temperatures might represent the lower limit of the thermal window of this fiddler crab, limiting its extension toward higher latitudes.

AB  - O2 flux, ATP and community biomass were measured in laboratory microcosms to monitor the response of a salt-marsh sediment community to individual and combined effects of Spartina detritus burial and constant, artificial illumination.  Detritus was added to stimulate the development of a decomposition community within the sediment and illumination was intended to promote development of a photosynthetic community near the sediment surface.  By including these two experimental treatments of the sediment in a factorial design, we were able to define the individual and combined effects of detrital enrichment and illumination over 73 days.  O2 flux was used as an index of the net effect of photosynthesis and decomposition.  Two techniques - one based on the measurement of O2 gradients in a stationary water column and the other based on O2 transfer from a stirred water column - were used to estimate flux.  Fluxes in stirred cores were consistently higher than measurements taken using the gradient technique.  Detrital enrichment resulted in significantly increased O2 flux in both illuminated and dark cores, regardless of the measurement technique.  In contrast, ATP and community biomass were significantly increased only by the combined effects of illumination and detritus.  The addition of detritus or illumination acting alone did not result in a significant increase in ATP biomass over the long term.  Multivariate ANOVA indicated that the response of the benthic community was dominated by the growth of nonpigmented, flagellated protozoans in the size range of 1-8-mu-m.  These, together with pennate diatoms and filamentous green algae attained significantly higher biomass only in response to a combination of illumination and detritus enrichment.

AB  - Iron is a vital micronutrient within coastal marine ecosystems, playing an integral role in the scale and dynamics of primary production and carbon cycling in the world's oceans. We investigated the relative importance of in situ Fe(II) production from photochemical, microbial and thermal Fe reduction in the surface water column as well as advective porewater inputs in a temperate saline wetland in Australia containing mangrove and salt-marsh vegetation. The diel average concentration of Fe(II) (0.63 +/- 0.21 mu M, accounting for > 70% of the total dissolved Fe present in surface water) was much higher than commonly reported in oxygenated marine waters despite high dissolved oxygen concentrations (81-112% saturation), pH (7.7-7.8) and salinity (33-36) that favor Fe oxidation. In situ production of Fe(II) in the surface water column was primarily driven by microbial processes rather than photochemical and thermal reduction, with a maximum production rate of 4.9 x 10(-3) nM s(-1). Advective porewater Fe(II) inputs to the wetland averaged over a diel cycle (3.0 x 10(-1) nM s(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the combined Fe(II) production rate from autochthonous water column processes (1.0 x 10(-2) nM s(-1)). A bottom up model based on the estimated individual fluxes was used to explain the high Fe(II) concentrations measured during a 24 h time series experiment. Combined, different lines of evidence suggest that advective porewater exchange provides significant quantities of Fe(II) to the estuarine wetland.

AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) were used to analyse food web dynamics of two of the main estuaries of the Portuguese coast: Tejo and Mira. The ultimate sources of organic matter supporting production of some of the most abundant and commercially important fish species were determined: and seasonal, inter- and intra- estuarine differences in the trophic relations among producers and consumers were identified. Stable isotope analysis was performed in different producers, primary consumers (main prey items for fish) and fish species (Solea solea, Solea senegalensis, Pomatoschistus microps, Dicentrarchus labrax, Liza ramada, Diplodus vulgaris and Atherina presbyter) of two areas in each estuary, in July and October 2009. Model calculations showed that the main prey for the fish species in the Tejo estuary used mostly salt marsh-derived organic matter as nutritional sources, with no marked differences between the sampled months. Trophic levels of fish species from the same estuary differed at multiple scales: inter-species, seasonally and spatially (both between and within estuaries). Significant differences in isotopic composition of fish species were more pronounced spatially (between the two sampled areas in the estuary) than seasonally (between sampled months). Trophic relationships in both estuaries demonstrated that organic matter is transferred to higher trophic positions mainly through benthic pathways. This shows the flexibility of these species to share resources and to exploit temporary peaks in prey populations. The present results showed that extensive disturbance in intertidal habitats from both estuaries may potentially change the balance of organic matter in the base of these complex food webs.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential use of halophyte Spartina alterniflora (SA) as forage for ruminants by detecting the effect of plant maturity on organic and mineral compositions as well as the effect of increasing dietary inclusion of S. alterniflora on rumen fermentation in dairy cattle. Crude protein (CP), ash content, and in vitro dry matter (DM) digestion of S. alterniflora exhibited a negative correlation with increasing maturity; however, biomass, DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content showed a positive correlation. Mineral composition drastically changed with increasing plant maturity. Compared with conventional diets, S. alterniflora mixed diets showed higher ash, NDF, ADF, ether extract, and Na, Ca, and P contents, and similar organic matter (OM), CP, and gross energy contents. DM and water intake of dairy cattle linearly increased from 0% to 25% SA in the diet. The mean values of the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA); the molar percentage of acetate, propionate, butyrate, and isobutyrate; and the acetate-to-propionate ratio did not significantly change at 12:00 h with increasing inclusion level of S. alterniflora in the diet. The initial findings obtained from the feed and rumen fermentation analysis of dairy cattle demonstrate that S. alterniflora can be utilized as potential forage for dairy cattle at less than 25% of the animal's diet. Overall, S. alterniflora could be provided with the potential to improve the sustainability of ruminant production as alternative feeds to replace partially common roughages, alleviate feeding cost and partially control the rapid spread of the invasive plant in salt marsh of China.

AB  - Stable nitrogen isotope ratios were used to study the incorporation of anthropogenically-derived nitrogen into the food webs of salt marsh systems along a contamination gradient in Narragansett Bay. Nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) were measured in six estuarine species collected from three marshes along this gradient, monthly from June to October between 1997 and 1999. A significant decrease in delta N-15 was found with distance along the estuary for four of the six species.
   Significant differences were found among monthly isotope ratios for some species. Nitrogen isotope ratios in sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) increased during the summer season with highest delta N-15 values measured during September and October. This trend was most pronounced at the station receiving the highest nutrient inputs. Elevated delta N-15 values at this station appeared to correlate with seawater ammonia/nitrate concentration ratios. The temporal variations in delta N-15 suggest that care should be taken in species selection and the design of sampling schemes of studies using delta N-15 for monitoring anthropogenic nutrients in aquatic systems. Sampling programs designed to determine long-term trends should consider species that do not show rapid fluctuations in isotope ratios. The mud snail, Nassarius obsoletus, responded this way in the present study. Studies designed to measure short-term changes should include species such as U. lactuca, which rapidly respond to isotope changes. The results from this study also help to establish a baseline for nitrogen isotope values in Narragansett Bay. This information can be used to monitor future trends in nitrogen inputs to this estuary. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Farmland salinization due to unsustainable agricultural practices has become a worldwide problem. Salt-resistant forage crops, introduced at the primary stages of land reclamation, can provide fodder for livestock, thus adding economic benefit to the process. Saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), a wild halophytic grass species distributed in salt marshes in America, is occasionally grazed by livestock and wild animals. In attempts to domesticate this species, we evaluated and ranked the fodder potential of groups of accessions from several sites in North and South America. Ash content never exceeded 110g kg(-1), even when plants were grown with salty water. Crude protein content was variable and averaged 116g kg(-1) of DM. Mean yield of metabolizable energy was 6.30 and 5.61 kJ g(-1) DM for sheep and goats, respectively. Organic matter digestibility (in vitro) was higher in sheep than in goats (506 g kg(-1) and 478 g kg(-1), respectively) for all saltgrass accessions. Differences in quality parameters were usually larger within than among groups of accession when sorted according to country of origin or ecosystem. Accessions from the South Atlantic coast of North America and from South America were superior in several parameters. South Atlantic coast accessions were relatively vigorous and were productive under saline conditions, as indicated by their relative growth rate (RGR) in small-scale experiments. Six outstanding saltgrass accessions were chosen for further examination. The results of the present study indicate that saltgrass holds considerable promise for selection and suggest that efforts should continue to identify and characterize additional saltgrass ecotypes.

AB  - Although several recent studies point at the importance of seagrass roots for nutrient acquisition in oligotrophic tropical ecosystems, remarkably little is known about the root architecture of tropical seagrasses. The present study provides a detailed description of the root architecture of six seagrass species that were extracted from three sites differing in sediment type and nutrient availability (i.e., except for one species that was not present at one of the sites). Number of roots per node, order of root branching, length and diameter per root order, root hair density and length were determined and used to calculate a topological index for the different species and habitats. Root architecture differed strongly between species. The relatively long-lived and slowly-growing species Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were characterised by short internodes with relatively few unbranched roots per node and a high root hair density. More fast growing species such as Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata and Syringodium isoetifolium had many roots per node, the majority of which were branched. Surprisingly, differences in sediment type and nutrient availability, as present between locations, had little effect on root architecture. We expect this to be due to a relatively homogeneous nutrient distribution at the small scale within water saturated sediments. Overall, all seagrass species had relatively simple branching (topological index > 0.7), comparable to angiosperms of the low temperate salt marsh. We speculate that relatively simple root architecture of plants in flooded systems reflects the need for a minimal path length for oxygen transport from shoots to roots.

AB  - Three sediment cores were collected from the southern coastal area of Zhoushan Island, and their lignin-derived phenol, bulk elemental composition, stable carbon isotope, particle size and 210Pb activities were determined. The objective of this study was to determine the compositional changes of the sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area in the past 80 years as a result of anthropogenic and oceanographic-related processes. The results of this study showed that the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter along this coastal area were affected by the accelerated development on these islands and mainland China. Moreover, the increased contribution of terrestrial organic matter from the rivers in the mainland from the 1930s to the 1980s was likely the result of human activities. The drastic increase in the vanillic acid to vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with the start of rapid development in Zhoushan, resulting in the increased erosion of more degraded terrestrial organic matter along the coast. Trends of increasing marine organic matter toward the present could be due to a combination of reduced river input and sea level rise. Overall, our results showed that the sedimentary organic matter along the southern coastal zone of Zhoushan main island was affected by riverine input from the mainland, and showed a tendency toward decreasing terrestrial organic matter and particle size. Thus, local input and increased phytoplankton production will play a more important role in the carbon dynamics in this coastal area in the future. (245 words).

AB  - Below ground biomass is a critical factor regulating ecosystem functions of coastal marshes, including soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation and the ability of these systems to keep pace with sea-level rise. Nevertheless, below ground biomass responses to environmental and vegetation changes have been given little emphasis marsh studies. Here we present a method using stable carbon isotopes and color to identify root and rhizomes of Schoenoplectus americanus (Pers.) Volk. ex Schinz and R. Keller (C-3) and Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. (C-4) occurring in C-3- and C-4-dominated communities in a Chesapeake Bay brackish marsh. The functional significance of the biomass classes we identified is underscored by differences in their chemistry, depth profiles, and variation in biomass and profiles relative to abiotic and biotic factors. C-3 rhizomes had the lowest concentrations of cellulose (29.19%) and lignin (14.43%) and the lowest C:N (46.97) and lignin:N (0.16) ratios. We distinguished two types of C-3 roots, and of these, the dark red C-3 roots had anomalously high C:N (195.35) and lignin:N (1.14) ratios, compared with other root and rhizome classes examined here and with previously published values. The C-4-dominated community had significantly greater below ground biomass (4119.1 g m(-2)) than the C-3-dominated community (3256.9 g m(-2)), due to greater total root biomass and a 3.6-fold higher C-3-root:rhizome ratio in the C-4-dominated community. C-3 rhizomes were distributed significantly shallower in the C-4-dominated community, while C-3 roots were significantly deeper. Variability in C3 rhizome depth distributions was explained primarily by C-4 biomass, and C-3 roots were explained primarily by water table height. Our results suggest that below ground biomass in this system is sensitive to slight variations in water table height (across an 8 cm range), and that the reduced overlap between C-3 and C-4 root profiles in the C-4-dominated community may account for the greater total root biomass observed in that community. Given that future elevated atmospheric CO2 and accelerated sea-level rise are likely to increase C-3 abundance in Atlantic and Gulf coast marshes, investigations that quantify how patterns of C-3 and C-4 below ground biomass respond to environmental and biological factors stand to improve our understanding of ecosystem-wide impacts of global changes on coastal wetlands.

AB  - Marshes on the southern North Sea coast store large amounts of organic matter (OM). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of inundation frequency on carbohydrates, organic carbon (OC), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (N) in a marine and a brackish marsh. To gain insights into the origin of OC in the marshes we used monosaccharides as biomarkers. We studied soils in a marine and a brackish marsh along a gradient of inundation frequency. It was found that TOC and N stocks in soils of a marine and a brackish marsh increased with decreasing inundation frequency. Concentrations of carbohydrates were significantly higher in the topsoils of the marine marsh than of the brackish marsh. In the upper mid-zone of the marine marsh, which is inundated by the sea approximately 20-times a year, carbohydrate stocks were up to 2.4-times higher than in the upper mid-zone of the brackish marsh with the same inundation frequency. Differences in carbohydrate concentrations can be attributed to differences in the abundance of fine and medium roots in these soils. In the daily-inundated soils of both marshes we observed high hexose-to-pentose ratios, indicating a microbial origin of the carbohydrates, while the hexose-to-pentose ratios were significantly lower in the middle and upper zone of the two marshes, indicating a high proportion of plant-derived carbohydrates. This study shows that monosaccharides are useful biomarkers to explore the origin of OM in coastal soils. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crabs play important roles in coastal ecosystems and are useful indicators for evaluating ecosystem health. Many previous studies have examined the distribution patterns of crabs among different habitats. However, we know little about what the key factors determining crab burrow distribution among types of habitats. Different kind of crab species may have different preferences of environmental conditions, here, we focus on the dominant crab species Hate tientsinensis in the Yellow River Delta. To identify the drivers of crab burrow distribution in intertidal marshes of the Yellow River Delta, we examined crab burrow density among seven habitats across different marsh zones, with reference to abiotic (water depth, soil hardness, water content, bulk density, porewater salinity, organic matter, total nitrogen and total carbon) and biotic (plant coverage, above- and belowground biomass, macrofauna species richness, abundance and biomass) factors that might explain crab burrow distribution patterns. Differences of all above factors were examined by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) among different habitats. The best single predictors of crab burrow density were tested by liner re- gression across the entire study area. Our results showed that patterns of crab burrow distribution were more strongly affected by abiotic drivers (water depth, water content, salinity, soil hardness, organic matter and total carbon) than biotic drivers. Crabs prefer habitats with softer and wetter edaphic conditions. In the future of coastal management, building habitats first, thereafter attracting crabs settling down and regulating feeding area of water birds and other benthic communities are good strategies to follow.

AB  - Coastal vegetation both mitigates the damage inflicted by marine disasters on coastal areas and plays an important role in the global carbon cycle (i.e., blue carbon). Nevertheless, detailed records of changes in coastal vegetation composition and diversity in the Holocene, coupled with climate change and river evolution, remain unclear. To explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors on the coastal area of the Bohai Sea (BS) during the Holocene, we present high-resolution pollen and sediment grain size data obtained from a sediment core of the BS. The results reveal that two rapid and abrupt changes in salt marsh vegetation are linked with the river system changes. Within each event, a recurring pattern - starting with a decline in Cyperaceae, followed by an increase in Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae - suggests a successional process that is determined by the close relationship between Yellow River (YR) channel shifts and the wetland community dynamics. The phreatophyte Cyperaceae at the base of each sequence indicate lower saline conditions. Unchannelized river flow characterized the onset of the YR channel shift, caused a huge river-derived sediment accumulation in the floodplain and destroyed the sedges in the coastal depression. Along with the formation of a new channel, lateral migration of the lower channel stopped, and a new intertidal mudflat was formed. Pioneer species (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia) were the first to colonize the bare zones of the lower and middle marsh areas. In addition, the pollen results revealed that the vegetation of the BS land area was dominated by broadleaved forests during the Early Holocene (8500-6500 BP) and by conifer and broadleaved forests in the Middle Holocene (6500-3500 BP), which was followed by an expansion of broadleaved trees (after 3500 BP). The pollen record indicated that a warmer Early and Late Holocene and colder Middle Holocene were consistent with previously reported temperature records for East Asia. The main driving factors of temperature variation in this region are insolation, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and greenhouse gases forcing.

AB  - Despite their moderately sized surface area, continental marginal seas play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, as they receive huge amounts of upwelled and riverine inputs of carbon and nutrients, sustaining a disproportionate large biological activity compared to their relative surface area. A synthesis of worldwide measurements of the partial pressure Of CO2 (pCO(2)) indicates that most open shelves in the temperate and high-latitude regions are under-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 during all seasons, although the low-latitude shelves seem to be over-saturated. Most inner estuaries and near-shore coastal areas on the other hand are over-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2. The scaling of air-sea CO2 fluxes based on pCO(2) measurements and carbon mass-balance calculations indicate that the continental shelves absorb atmospheric CO2 ranging between 0.33 and 0.36 Pg C yr(-1) that corresponds to an additional sink of 27% to similar to 30% of the CO2 uptake by the open oceans based on the most recent pCO(2) climatology [Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S.C., Wanninkhof, R., Sweeney, C., Feely, R.A., Chipman, D., Hales, B., Friederich, G., Chavez, F., Watson, A., Bakker, D., Schuster, U., Metzl, N., Inoue, H.Y., Ishii, M., Midorikawa, T., Sabine, C., Hoppema, M., Olafsson, J., Amarson, T., Tilbrook, B., Johannessen, T., Olsen, A., Bellerby, R., De Baar, H., Nojiri, Y., Wong.

Deep-Sea Research 11, this issue [doi: 10.1016/j.dsr2.2008.12.009].]. Inner estuaries, salt marshes and mangroves emit up to 0.50 Pg C yr(-1), although these estimates are prone to large uncertainty due to poorly constrained ecosystem surface area estimates. Nevertheless, the view of continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2 allows reconciling long-lived opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.

AB  - Many urban estuaries worldwide contain both eutrophication-induced macroalgal blooms and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in their sediments. Between 2007 and 2012, we studied an annually occurring green tide of Ulva rigida in the PCB-contaminated Superfund site of New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA. Ulva PCB concentrations were highest (95-99 mg kg(-1) dry weight) near the contamination source and decreased to only 2-4 mg kg(-1) at the site's southern end, approximately 2.5 km away. To assess the bloom's potential role as a PCB contributor to higher trophic levels, we performed stomach content analysis on the system's primary mid-trophic level predator, the salt marsh mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, and stable isotope analysis on associated potential energy sources. In addition to detritus and macroinvertebrate prey, Ulva was a major component of mummichog stomach contents, and a N-15-labeled feeding experiment demonstrated that mummichogs can assimilate ingested Ulva. Among invertebrate prey, stable isotope mixing models showed Uiva as the main diet source for amphipods Gammarus spp., while grass shrimp Palaemonetes spp. and sandworms Nereis spp. relied on a mix of Lava and Spartina or particulate organic matter, respectively. Sandworms and grass shrimp were the main mummichog energy sources, suggesting that this estuarine keystone species is linked to the (Eva bloom mainly through predation on Ova-consuming grazers rather than direct ingestion. Our data provide evidence for a potentially overlooked impact of macroalgal blooms-namely, their potential role in the trophic transfer of PCBs and other bioaccumulated pollutants.

AB  - Bacterioplankton communities play a key role in aquatic carbon cycling, specifically with respect to the magnitude of organic carbon processed and partitioning of this carbon into biomass and respiratory losses. Studies of bacterioplankton carbon demand (BCD) and growth efficiency (BGE) frequently report higher values in more productive systems, suggesting these aspects of carbon metabolism may be positively coupled. However, the existence of such a relationship in natural aquatic systems has yet to be identified. Using a comprehensive 2-year study of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism in a temperate estuary, we investigated BCD and BGE and explored factors that may modulate their magnitude and coherence, including nutrient concentrations, dissolved nutrient uptake and source and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). During the course of our study, BCD ranged from 0.4 to 15.9 mu g l(-1) h(-1), with an overall mean of 3.8 mu g l(-1) h(-1). Mean BGE was similar to that reported for other estuarine systems (0.32) and of comparable range (that is, 0.06 - 0.68). Initial analyses identified a negative correlation between BCD and BGE, yet removal of the effect of temperature revealed an underlying positive coupling that was also correlated with long-term DOC lability. Whereas BCD was weakly related to ambient DOC concentrations, neither BCD nor BGE showed any relationship with ambient nutrient concentrations or nutrient uptake stoichiometries. We conclude that in this carbon-rich estuary, organic matter source and quality play an important role in regulating the magnitude of carbon metabolism and may be more important than nutrient availability alone in the regulation of BGE.

AB  - Coastal wetlands have two dimensions of vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR), a vertical one, in cases where SLR outpaces their capacity to vertically accrete, and a lateral one, in cases where they are restricted from migrating inland by topography and land use. We conducted a meta-analysis of accretion rates, standardized our analysis by using only Cs-137 based estimates, and used model intercomparison to generate a vertical resilience index, a function of local SLR, tidal range, and tidal elevation category for the tidal wetlands of the contiguous US. We paired the vertical resilience index with a lateral resilience index made up of elevation, water level, and land cover maps, then projected them both into the future using localized SLR scenarios. At the regional scale, the vertical resilience index predicts changes from marsh aggradation to submergence for the coastal US Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and portions of the Northeast by 2100. At the sub-regional scale, there is a geographic tradeoff between vertical and lateral resilience with more northerly wetlands vulnerable to the lack of suitable proportional area to migrate into, and more southerly wetlands vulnerable to accretion deficit. We estimate between 43% and 48% of the existing contiguous US wetland area, almost entirely located in watersheds along the Gulf of Mexico and Mid-Atlantic coasts, is subject to both vertical and lateral limitations. These vertical and lateral resilience indices could help direct future research, planning, and mitigation efforts at a national scale, as well as supplement more processed informed approaches by local planners and practitioners.

AB  - The invasion of Spartina alterniflora along the coasts of China has allowed this C-4 grass to outcompete often much of the native, salt marsh vegetation, such as Phragmites australis (C-3 grass), in the Yangtze Estuary. In this study, native grass, P. australis, and non-native grass, S. alterniflora, were grown in fresh and saline water (moderate salinity of 15aEuro degrees and high salinity of 30aEuro degrees) to compare the effects of salinity on photosynthetic and biochemical parameters in combination with measurement temperatures. The C-4 grass, S. alterniflora, showed a greater CO2 assimilation rate than P. australis, across the tested temperatures. The net photosynthetic rate declined significantly with increasing salinity as a result of inhibited stomatal conductance together with a greater decrease in the maximum rate of electron transport (J (max)). In P. australis, salt treatments shifted the optimum temperatures for the maximum rate of carboxylation by Rubisco (V (cmax)) and J (max) to lower temperatures. S. alterniflora showed a greater salt tolerance to moderate stress than that of the native grass, with lower sensitivity of V (cmax), J (max), and the maximum rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylation. Both moderate and high stress decreased significantly stomatal conductance of S. alterniflora; high salinity reduced significantly photosynthetic efficiency and J (max). Our findings indicated that the combination of stomatal conductance, enzyme activity, and electron transport affected the photosynthetic performance of the plants in response to salt treatments. The success of S. alterniflora could be probably attributed to its C-4 photosynthetic pathway and the tolerance to moderate salinity. In this study, a modified parameterization of the photosynthetic model was suggested to support a more reasonable simulation of photosynthesis under salt stress.

AB  - Most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) entering aquatic systems reside in sediments and in the storage lipids of the benthic biota. Massive amounts of PAHs reach estuarine systems and threaten their ecosystems. Copepods abound in the estuarine benthos, where they are an important component of food webs. The accumulation of sediment-associated [C-14]fluoranthene was examined in adult females of two species of sediment-dwelling copepods, Schizopera knabeni and Coullana sp., collected from a Louisiana salt marsh. Accumulation was measured throughout a short- (24 h) and a long-term (10-day) exposure to concentrations in the sediment ranging from 0 to 1652 nmol (g dry wt.)(-1). Fluoranthene apparent steady slate body residue was reached very rapidly(< 12 h) at all concentrations for both species. Lipid and organic-carbon-normalized bioaccumulation factors (BSAFs) calculated at day 1 were 0.57-0.80 for S, knabeni and 0.35-0.71 for Coullana sp. Fluoranthene body burden in female Coullana sp. changed dramatically during their reproductive cycle. A significant fraction of the fluoranthene residue was stored in the lipid-rich maturing eggs which were extruded into paired egg sacs. For S, knabeni, fluoranthene depuration occurred at similar rates in sediment and water (half life approximately 4.8 h), while it was faster in sediment than in water for Coullana sp. (half lives = 4.2 and 7.4 h). Fluoranthene was biotransformed to polar compounds in both species. Metabolites accounted for approximately 12% of the C-14 activity in the tissues following a 96-h sediment exposure in both species, Given that fluoranthene was taken up from spiked sediment very efficiently and reached steady-state levels in the tissues very rapidly, PAH-contaminated sediments may pose a risk for benthic copepods and their predators.

AB  - The River Elbe, as one of the major waterways of central Europe, is a potential source of high amounts of methane into the North Sea. Twelve sampling cruises from October 2010 until June 2013 were conducted from Hamburg towards the mouth of the Elbe at Cuxhaven. The dynamic of methane concentrations in the water column and its consumption via methane oxidizing bacteria was measured. In addition, physico-chemical parameters were used to estimate their influence on the methanotrophic activity. We observed high methane concentrations at the stations in the area of Hamburg harbour ("upper estuary'') and about 10 times lower concentrations in the lower estuary (median of 416 versus 40 nmol L-1, respectively). The methane oxidation rate mirrored the methane distribution with high values in the upper estuary and low values in the lower estuary (median of 161 versus 10 nmol L-1 day(-1), respectively). Methane concentrations were significantly influenced by the river hydrology (falling water level) and the biological oxygen demand while interestingly, no clear relation to the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was found. Methane oxidation rates were significantly influenced by methane concentration and to a lesser extent by temperature. Methane oxidation accounted for 41 +/- 12 % of the total loss of methane in summer/fall periods, but for only 5 +/- 3 % of the total loss in the winter/spring periods (total loss = methane oxidation ? diffusion into the atmosphere). The average sea-air flux of methane was 33 +/- 8 g CH4 m(-2) y(-1). We applied a box model taking into account the residence times of each water parcel depending on discharge and tidal impact. We observed almost stable methane concentrations in the lower estuary, despite a strong loss of methane through diffusion and oxidation. Thus we postulate that losses in the lower Elbe estuary were balanced by additional inputs of methane, possibly from extensive salt marshes near the river mouth.

AB  - The past few hundred years have seen large fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 concentration. In part, these have been the result of natural factors, including the climatic changes of the Little Ice Age, and the Sporer and Maunder solar activity minima. In addition, however, changes in human activity since the middle of the 19th century have released C-14-free CO2 to the atmosphere. Moreover, between c. 1955 and c. 1963, atmospheric nuclear weapon testing resulted in a dramatic increase in the concentration of C-14 in the atmosphere. This was followed by a significant decrease in atmospheric C-14 as restrictions on nuclear weapon testing began to take effect and as rapid exchange occurred between the atmosphere and other carbon reservoirs. The large fluctuations in atmospheric C-14 that occurred prior to 1955 mean that a single radiocarbon date may yield an imprecise calibrated age consisting of several possible age ranges. This difficulty may be overcome by obtaining a series of C-14 dates from a sequence and either wiggle-matching these dates to a radiocarbon calibration curve or using additional information on dated materials and their surrounding environment to narrow the calibrated age ranges associated with each C-14 date. For the period since 1955 (the bomb-pulse period), significant differences in atmospheric C-14 levels between consecutive years offer the possibility of dating recent samples with a resolution of from one to a few years. These approaches to dating the recent past are illustrated using examples from peats, lake and salt marsh sediments, tree rings, marine organisms and speleothems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We used stable C and N isotope ratios of tissues from 29 fish species from a large subtropical lagoon in southern Brazil to examine spatial variability in isotopic composition and vertical trophic structure across freshwater and estuarine habitats. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated a smooth gradation in trophic positions among species, with most fishes occupying the secondary and tertiary consumer level. Fish assemblages showed a significant shift in their carbon isotopic signatures between freshwater and estuarine sites. Depleted carbon signatures (from -24.7 parts per thousand., to - 17.8 parts per thousand) were found in freshwater, whereas more enriched signatures (from - 19.1 parts per thousand to - 12.3 parts per thousand) were obtained within the estuarine zone downstream. Based on our survey of the C-3 and C-4 plants and isotopic values for phytoplankton and benthic microalgae reported for ecosystems elsewhere, we hypothesized that the observed delta C-13 differences in the fish assemblage between freshwater and estuarine sites is due to a shift from assimilating organic matter ultimately derived from C-3 freshwater marsh vegetation and phytoplankton at the freshwater site (delta C-13 ranging from -25 parts per thousand to - 19 parts per thousand), to C-4 salt-marsh (e.g. Spartina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton at the estuarine sites (from - 18 parts per thousand to - 12 parts per thousand). Our results suggested that fish assemblages are generally supported by autochthonous primary production. Freshwater fishes that likely were displaced downstream into the estuary during periods of high freshwater discharge had depleted delta C-13 values that were characteristic of the upper lagoon. These results suggest that spatial foodweb subsidies can occur within the lagoon. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) is an important pathway for gaseous carbon loss in coastal wetland environments. However, little is known regarding the dynamics of Rem and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) under different tidal stages, and vegetation types. In this study, R-eco was measured with dark chambers for nearly 2 years in three different brackish marsh stands dominated by Cyperus malaccensis, Phragmites australis, and Spartina alterniflora, respectively, in the Min River estuary of southeast China. The mean R-eco, across tidal stages and vegetation types exhibited strong temporal variations, and the Q(10) value for R-eco was higher in the warm months than in the cold months. The mean annual Reco was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity and soil water content, but positively correlated with both tidal water level and soil pH (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the seasonal variation in R-eco and Q(10) was largely driven by the thermal regimes and soil salinity. Also, we found that the mean Reco and Q(s10) value were both relatively higher when the site was exposed before tidal inundation, as compared to that after tidal inundation for all the vegetation types studied (P > 0.05). Overall, the C. malacensis and S. altemiflora stands had the highest and lowest average rates of Reco, respectively, while the mean Q(s10) values were lower in the Phragmites australis stand than the other two vegetation types. Our findings point to the need of strengthening the in situ measurements of gas fluxes at multiple time scales in order to develop a better understanding of the response of Reco to changing environmental conditions in the subtropical coastal wetlands. Our results also reiterate the importance of considering the influence of vegetation types in characterizing the magnitude and temperature sensitivity of Reco in estuarine tidal marshes for predicting ecosystem responses to future global change.

AB  - Coastal protection, nutrient cycling, erosion control, water purification, and carbon sequestration are ecosystem services provided by salt marshes. Additionally, salt ponds offer coastal breeding and a nursery habitat for fishes and they provide abundant invertebrates, such as amphipods, which are potentially useful as a resource in aquaculture. Fishmeal and fish oil are necessary food resources to support aquaculture of carnivorous species due to their omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA). Currently, aquaculture depends on limited fisheries and feed with elevated n-3 LC-PUFA levels, but the development of more sustainable food sources is necessary. Amphipods appear to be a potential high quality alternative feed resource for aquaculture. Hence, a nutritional study was carried out for several main amphipod speciesMicrodeutopus gryllotalpa, Monocorophium acherusicum, Gammarus insensibilis, Melita palmata and Cymadusa filosain terrestrial ponds in the South of Spain. These species showed high protein content (up to 40%), high n-3 PUFA and phospholipid levels, and high levels of phophatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and triacylglycerols (TAG), the latter being significantly high for M. acherusicum. M. gryllotalpa and M. acherusicum showed the highest proportion of lipids (19.15% and 18.35%, respectively). Isoleucine, glycine and alanine were the dominant amino acids in all species. In addition, amphipods collected from ponds showed low levels of heavy metals. Furthermore, the biochemical profiles of the five species of amphipods have been compared with other studied alternative prey. Therefore, pond amphipods are good candidates to be used as feed, and are proposed as a new sustainable economic resource to be used in aquaculture. G. insensibilis may be the best for intensive culture as an alternative feed resource because it shows: (1) adequate n-3 PUFA and PL composition; (2) high levels of glycine, alanine, tyrosine, isoleucine and lysine; (3) high natural densities; (4) large body size (>= 1 cm), and (5) high concentration of calcium. Moreover, a combined culture of amphipods and fishes in these marsh ponds seems a promising and environmentally sustainable way to develop Integrate Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) in these ecosystems.

AB  - We measured organic carbon input and content of soil in two wetland areas of Chongming Dongtan (Yangtze River Estuary) to evaluate variability in organic carbon accumulation capability in different wetland soils. Observed differences were investigated based on the microbial activity and environmental factors of the soil at the two sites. Results showed that the organic carbon content of wetland soil vegetated with Phragmites australis (site A) was markedly lower than that with P australis and Spartina altemiflora (site B). Sites differences were due to higher microbial activity at site A, which led to higher soil respiration intensity and greater carbon outputs. This indicated that the capability of organic carbon accumulation of the site B soils was greater than at site A. In addition, petroleum pollution and soil salinity were different in the two wetland soils. After bio-remediation, the soil petroleum pollution at site B was reduced to a similar level of site A. However, the culturable microbial biomass and enzyme activity in the remediated soils were also lower than at site A. These results indicated that greater petroleum pollution at site B did not markedly inhibit soil microbial activity. Therefore, differences in vegetation type and soil salinity were the primary factors responsible for the variation in microbial activity, organic carbon output and organic carbon accumulation capability between site A and site B.

AB  - Pollutant metals (Cu, Ph, Zn and Cd) in Late Flandrian mudflat/saltmarsh sediments in the Severn Estuary are predominantly bound in the carbonate, Fe/Mn oxide and organic phases. Comparison of the oxic Rumney Formation with the suboxic Wentlooge Formation shows that redox conditions control iron cycling, and that this in turn controls trace metal associations. An important fraction of the trace metals present in the Fe/Mn oxide phase in oxic sediments (such as the Rumney Formation) is remobilised during iron reduction and reprecipitated in other phases such as authigenic carbonates (as in the Wentlooge). Since many metal pollutants are highly redox sensitive, a better understanding of the effects of redox on metal speciation in estuarine sediments is useful for management of the coastal environment.

AB  - The distribution and seasonal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in newborn coastal wetland of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) estuary at eastern China were studied based on monitoring data in 2009 at two transects from the bank of the Yellow River to the seaside. The results showed that SOC contents of 0-60cm soil layer in transects ranged from 0.46 to 10.15gkg(-1) and average values of soil profiles ranged from 2.15 to 5.00gkg(-1). The SOC contents tended to increase from the river flood land to the salt beach, which could be accounted for the organic matters including large algae, the bodies and excretion of marine animals due to the feedback of tides. The significant difference of SOC contents at different vegetation communities was observed, while the difference of SOC in soil profiles was not obvious. The SOC contents in 0-30cm soil layers decreased with plant growth period, while in 40-60cm soil layers were relatively stable. The mean soil organic carbon density was 3.05kgCm(-2) in study region, which was much lower than that reported in other ecosystems, and its spatiotemporal variations were consistent with that of SOC content. Further analysis revealed that SOC was positively correlated with total nitrogen and clay contents. Our findings indicated that the newborn coastal wetland in the YRD should be a potential sink of SOC.

AB  - Coastal wetland vegetation communities can respond to sea level rise via the encroachment of more salt- and inundation-tolerant species into existing vegetation communities. Black mangroves (Avicennia germinans L.) are encroaching on saltgrass (Distichlis spicata L.) within the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge in east central Florida (USA). Nine soil cores collected along three transects captured the transitions of both perceived abiotic drivers (salinity and inundation) and vegetation communities during both high- and low-water seasons to investigate patterns in soil biogeochemical cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Results showed no change in soil carbon dioxide production along the ecotone during either season, though changes in enzyme activity and mineralization rates of N and P could indicate changes in C quality and nutrient availability affecting C degradation along the ecotone. All parameters, excluding microbial biomass carbon, showed higher rates of activity or availability during the low-water season. Long-term soil nutrient stores (total C, N, P) were greatest in the saltgrass soils and similar between the mangrove and transition zone soils, indicating a 'tipping point' in biogeochemical function where the transition zone is functionally equivalent to the encroaching mangrove zone. Indicators of current biogeochemical cycling (that is, enzyme activity, potentially mineralizable N rates, and extractable ammonium concentrations) showed alterations in activity across the ecotone, with the transition zone often functioning with lower activity than within end members. These indicators of current biogeochemical cycling change in advance of full vegetation shifts. Increases in salinity and inundation were linked to mangrove encroachment.

AB  - The extensive spread of Phragmites australis throughout brackish marshes on the East Coast of the United States is a major factor governing management and restoration decisions because it is assumed that biogeochemical functions are altered by the invasion. Microbial activity is important in providing wetland biogeochemical functions such as carbon and nitrogen cycling, but there is little known about sediment microbial communities in Phragmites marshes. Microbial populations associated with invasive Phragmites vegetation and with native salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, may differ in the relative abundance of microbial taxa (community structure) and in the ability of this biota to decompose organic substrates (community biogeochemical function). This study compares sediment microbial communities associated with Phragmites and Spartina vegetation in an undisturbed brackish marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey (MUL), and in a brackish marsh in the anthropogenically affected Hackensack Meadowlands (SMC). We use phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and enzymatic activity to profile sediment microbial communities associated with both plants in each site. Sediment analyses include bulk density, total organic matter, and root biomass. PLFA profiles indicate that the microbial communities differ between sites with the undisturbed site exhibiting greater fatty acid richness (62 PLFA recovered from MUL versus 38 from SMC). Activity of the 5 enzymes analyzed (beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, chitobiase, and 2 oxidases) was higher in the undisturbed site. Differences between vegetation species as measured by Principal Components Analysis were significantly greater at the undisturbed MUL site than at SMC, and patterns of enzyme activity and PLFAs did not correspond to patterns of root biomass. We suggest that in natural wetland sediments, macrophyte rhizosphere effects influence the community composition of sediment microbial populations. Physical and chemical site disturbances may impose limits on these rhizosphere effects, decreasing sediment microbial diversity and potentially, microbial biogeochemical functions.

AB  - Based on the palynological record of core REG 972, this work aimed to reconstruct the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental history from 66.5 to 47 kyr BP at the south Brazilian continental margin, as well as to identify the influence of continental discharge in the southern portion of the Rio Grande Cone. Nineteen samples were processed following the standard methodology for palynological studies. Organic matter (OM) content was measured in the sediments. The age model was established according to O-18 isotopes analyses in benthic foraminiferal tests. The studied interval corresponds to a glacial interval, divided in palynozones (PZs): PZIa (66.5-64.5 kyr), PZIb (64.5-53.5 kyr), and PZII (53.5-47 kyr). PZIa was characterized by drier conditions, with grassland and salt marsh taxa dominance (Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae). During PZIb and PZII, the increase of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Araucaria angustifolia, Arecaceae, and Alchornea triplinervia points to wetter and warmer conditions that may be related to the beginning of marine isotope stage 3 and later to the sea-level rise. In the oceanic environment, the presence of freshwater algae and marine indicators lead to the conclusion that marine conditions prevailed during Rio Grande Cone sedimentary formation, even under low sea-level conditions when terrigenous influence was stronger. The data on OM content, dinoflagellate taxa, and mean sea level changes point to a period of low productivity during PZI. In PZII, a period of higher productivity took place because of Subantarctic Shelf Water influence, bringing cold and nutrient-rich waters to the area.

AB  - PHYTOGENIC mounds (nebkhas) formed by halophytes are widely distributed in coastal and desert environments. Such nebkhas provide loci for geochemical and biological activities that influence ecosystem processes and function. Seasonal variation in soil and bacterial properties were investigated within the nebkhas under the canopy of Halocnemum strobilaceum and in the surrounding unvegetated sites at salt marshes of Lake Manzala. The parameters measured include soil moisture, organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and bacterial community and enzyme characteristics. Enrichment ratios for soil salinity and nutrients were evaluated to indicate the salinity and fertility islands within nebkhas. Soil moisture content showed significant differences between the different seasons with the highest value in winter (16.55%) at unvegetated control site. Soil electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and phosphorus had their significantly higher values in nebkhas during autumn. The enrichment values for the measured soil parameters ranged from 0.31 to 4.09 in the four seasons which indicates a clear accumulation effect for soil nutrients and salts within the nebkhas under the canopy of H. strobilaceum. Bacterial abundance was consistently higher in nebkhas through all seasons. Eleven genera of bacteria belong to Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and proteobacteria phyla were recorded in nebkha and unvegetated sites. These genera varied in their occurrence between the two locations and the four seasons. It can be concluded that the formation of nebkhas by halophytic vegetation have noticeable effects on accumulation of soil salinity and fertility during different seasons that affect bacterial abundance and activity in coastal environment.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to examine the vegetative, sedimentary, nekton and hydrologic response to ecological re-engineering of a freshwater Impoundment in the Upper Bay of Fundy The dyke was breached in five locations and one channel initiated to connect the river to the borrow pit behind the dyke This triggered significant self-organization within the restoration site Existing channels (e g borrow pit) were incorporated within the newly excavated and developing creek system, increasing the hydraulic connectivity within the marsh and increasing fish habitat Vegetation colonization, primarily by Spartina alterniflora, was rapid with almost 100% coverage by the end of the third year Species associated with high marsh communities such as Juncus gerardu. Scirpus robustus. Ranunculus cymbalaria and Puccinellia maritima were present in increasing abundance post-restoration at the restoration site The constructed channel eroded downward 2 3 m and the head of the channel retreated 35 m in response to the increased tidal prism. In the year immediately following the breach (2006), the surface of the marsh was unconsolidated and rates of change in sur face elevation measured at RSET stations ranged from -0 7 (+/- 0.1) to 1 7 (+/- 0 2)cm yr(-1) (+/- ISE) Measurements between years are highly variable By year 3 the rate of surface elevation change decreased to a more moderate but variable mean of 0 3 (+/- 0 6) cm yr(-1) with the marker horizons recording mean accretion rates of 0 7 cm yr(-1). This implies subsurface consolidation as the sediments dewatered or organic matter decomposed and vegetation became more established Fish density decreased after restoration, however, remained higher than at the reference site for most years (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - A hybrid cordgrass, formed from a cross between Spartina alterniflora (Atlantic cordgrass) and S. foliosa (Pacific cordgrass), has recently spread within the intertidal zone of south San Francisco Bay. Sediment properties and macroinfaunal community structure were compared in patches invaded by Spartina hybrid and adjacent uninvaded patches at 3 sites in San Francisco Bay (2 tidal flats and 1 Salicornia marsh). We hypothesized that (1) sediments vegetated by Spartina hybrid would have reduced sediment grain size, higher organic matter content, lower redox potential, lower salinity and reduced microalgal biomass relative to adjacent unvegetated tidal flat sediments, and (2) that differences in the sediment environment would correspond to changes in the infaunal invertebrate community structure and feeding modes. We observed 75 % lower total macro-faunal density and lower species richness in Spartina-vegetated sediments at Elsie Roemer (30 yr old invasion) than in an adjacent unvegetated tidal flat. This was due to lower densities of surface-feeding amphipods, bivalves, cirratulid and spionid polychaetes. The proportional representation of subsurface-deposit feeders was greater in Spartina patches than in unvegetated sediments. At a more recently invaded site (Roberts Landing; 15 yr invasion), Spartina patches differed from tidal flat sediments in composition, but not in abundance. Native (Salicornia) and Spartina patches exhibited similar sediment properties at San Mateo, where the Spartina hybrid invaded 8 to 10 yr earlier. No differences were detected in densities or proportions of surface- or subsurface-deposit feeders, but the proportion of carnivores/omnivores and grazers increased in the hybrid-invaded patches. These studies suggest that the invasive Spartina hybrid in south San Francisco Bay can have differing effects on sediment ecosystems, possibly depending on the location, age, or type of habitats involved.

AB  - To evaluate marine sediment quality in the Gulf of Cadiz, chemical concentration and toxicity test endpoints from sediments were linked using multivariate analysis. Sediment samples were collected synoptically at seven stations in two littoral ecosystems of the Gulf of Cadiz (five in the Bay of Cadiz and two in the salt marsh of the Barbate River), and subjected to six separate, replicated sediment toxicity tests and comprehensive sediment chemistry analyses. The toxic effects of sediments were tested using three operational sediment phases: whole sediment, using the estuarine amphipod Microdeutopus gryllotalpa (10 d static: survival) and the estuarine clam Ruditapes philippinarum (48 h static: reburial); sediment elutriates, using larvae of the estuarine bivalve Crassostrea angulata (48 h static: survival) and of the marine fish Sparus aurata (48 h static: survival); and interstitial water, using populations of the estuarine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (7 d static: population decline) and of the marine bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum (Microtox(R)). To evaluate the levels of contamination, the concentrations in the sediments of organic carbon, 14 trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ag, Hg, As, Sn, V, Ni, Co and Cr) and the surfactant linear alkylbenzenesulphonate (LAS) were measured. The results of the toxicity tests were compared in a dose-response relationship between sites, demonstrating a general agreement between the toxicity values determined by all the tests, except in the case of interstitial water toxicity (principally due to toxic mixtures of trace metals). Data derived from sediment chemistry and bioassays were assembled by multivariate statistical techniques (PCA and factor analysis), showing that the two data types could be represented by only five factors corresponding to five overlapping chemical-biological effect relations. Positive prevalence of these factors in the cases studied was used to establish those ranges in chemical concentrations associated with adverse effects, The sediment quality guidelines. in terms of concentrations at or below which biological effects have been shown to be minimal (mg kg(-1) dry sediment), are: Hg, 0.25; Ag, 0.78; Pb, 66.80; Cr, 101.2; LAS, 2.6.

AB  - Palaeoenviroments inferred from stable carbon isotope ratios of fossil plants collected from various environments of the Cenomanian of Bohemia were compared with palaeobotanical and sedimentological data to test the use of isotope ratios as a record of local palaeoenviromnents and fossil-plant ecology. A number of isotope and biogeochemical patterns suggested that stable carbon isotope ratios in the Cenomanian plants from Bohemia have not been significantly affected by diagenesis. Stable carbon isotope ratios of the palaeoflora from one of the sections studied were used as a reference for a non-stressed habitat since both sedimentological and palaeobotanical evidence suggested that the fossil flora underwent no environmental Stresses that Could have influenced its 6degreesC values. Comparisons of delta(13)C values of the other palaeofloras with that of the reference section. allowed inference of the palaeoenvironmental stresses undergone by fossil plants. These palaeoenvironmental patterns deduced from C-13/C-12 ratios are in agreement with the palacoenvironments previously reconstructed by sedimentological and palaeobotanical studies. Combining evidence from those studies with isotope data provided detailed insights into the palaeoecology of the plants studied. Finally, stable carbon isotope ratios allowed precise characterisation of the ecology of the best-represented species of the deposits studied, the ginkgoalean plant Eremophyllum obotsum and the conifer Frenelopsis alata, which were quite common in the salt-marsh environments in Europe during the Cenomanian. Hence, stable carbon isotope ratios can help in evaluating the environmental stresses undergone by fossil plants and the combination of these results with palaeobotanical and sedimentological data can provide detailed insights into fossil-plant ecology.

AB  - Invasion of Spartina alterniflora in coastal areas of China increased methane (CH4) emissions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we measured CH4 production potential, methanogen community structure and biogeochemical factors along a coastal wetland transect comprised of five habitat regions: open water, bare tidal flat, invasive S. alterniflora marsh and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis marshes. CH4 production potential in S. alterniflora marsh was 10 times higher than that in other regions, and it was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and trimethylamine concentrations, but was not correlated with acetate or formate concentrations. Although the diversity of methanogens was lowest in S. alterniflora marsh, invasion increased methanogen abundance by 3.48-fold, compared with native S. salsa and P. australis marshes due to increase of facultative Methanosarcinaceae rather than acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ordination analyses suggested that trimethylamine was the primary factor regulating shift in methanogen community structure. Addition of trimethylamine increased CH4 production rates by 1255-fold but only by 5.61-and 11.4-fold for acetate and H-2/CO2, respectively. S. alterniflora invasion elevated concentration of non-competitive trimethylamine, and shifted methanogen community from acetotrophic to facultative methanogens, which together facilitated increased CH4 production potential.

AB  - A high-resolution study of a marsh sedimentary sequence from the Minho estuary provides a new palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from NW Iberian based on geological proxies supported by historical and instrumental climatic records. A low-salinity tidal flat, dominated by Trochamminita salsa, Haplophragmoides spp. and Cribrostomoides spp., prevailed from AD 140-1360 (Roman Warm Period, Dark Ages, Medieval Climatic Anomaly). This sheltered environment was affected by high hydrodynamic episodes, marked by the increase in silt/clay ratio, decrease of organic matter, and poor and weakly preserved foraminiferal assemblages, suggesting enhanced river runoff. The establishment of low marsh began at AD 1380. This low-salinity environment, marked by colder and wet conditions, persisted from AD 1410-1770 (Little Ice Age), when foraminiferal density increased significantly. Haplophragmoides manilaensis and Trochamminita salsa mark the transition from low to high marsh at AD 1730. Since AD 1780 the abundances of salt marsh species (Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata) increased, accompanied by a decrease in foraminiferal density, reflecting climate instability, when droughts alternate with severe floods. SW Europe marsh foraminifera respond to the hydrological balance, controlled by climatic variability modes (e.g., NAO) and solar activity, thus contributing to the understanding of NE Atlantic climate dynamics.

AB  - Fringing marshes are abundant ecosystems that dominate the New England coastline. Despite their abundance, very little baseline data is available from them and few studies have documented the ecosystems services that they provide. This information is important for conservation efforts as well as for an increased understanding of how fringing marshes function compared to larger marsh meadow systems. Benthic infaunal invertebrates were sampled from cores collected from Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh, Spartina patens-dominated high marsh, and Phragmites australis-invaded high marsh zones of nine fringing marsh ecosystems in Casco Bay, Maine, USA. Infaunal densities and biomass were generally higher in low marsh than high marsh or P. australis cores. Invertebrate community structure was significantly different between low marsh and high marsh and P. australis cores, which was attributed to significantly higher pore water salinity, lower organic matter, total plant percent cover, and S. patens cover in low marsh zones. There were no differences in invertebrate densities, biomass, or community structure when high marsh and P. australis cores were compared. Invertebrate densities and community structure were dominated by oligochaetes in all zones. Oligochaetes were also an important component of infaunal biomass, but the less abundant and larger invertebrates such as green crabs, tanaids, and bivalves were also large contributors to biomass in the low marsh zone. Low marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by significantly higher densities of nematodes, Nereis virens, an unidentified oligochaete, the bivalves Gemma gemma and Mya arenaria, and Leptochelia rapax. High marsh invertebrate communities were characterized by higher densities of insects, specifically Culicoides sp. ceratopogonid larvae and Anurida maritima, as well as an unidentified species of mite. Our results revealed a diverse and abundant infaunal invertebrate community that likely supports similar ecosystem services in fringing marshes as invertebrates in larger marsh meadows.

AB  - Measurements of isotopic composition of marine primary producers are a valuable tool to follow and trace the source and cycling of organic matter in the marine systems, as well to describe the physiological status of aquatic photosynthetic organisms. Although stable isotope data abounds in the literature, relatively limited information regarding the isotopic signatures of marine primary producers is available for the Red Sea. Here we present data on carbon concentration (and nitrogen when possible) of phytoplankton, macroalgae, seagrasses, mangroves and salt-marsh plants, and examine how their isotopic signatures differed among plant types across a north-south gradient in the Red Sea. We also tested the potential use of deuterium, delta D, to distinguish among primary producers whose carbon isotopic values may overlap. Our findings showed a clear differentiation of carbon and nitrogen content between the different groups of primary producers, as well as between species. Seagrasses and mangroves had on average larger carbon (30 and 49% of C, respectively) and nitrogen content (1.8% N) than other groups. In terms of stable carbon isotopes, seagrasses, and macroalgae tended to be heavier (-7.3 and -13.3 parts per thousand, respectively) than halophytes, mangroves, and phytoplankton, which showed statistically similar and lighter delta C-13 values (between -24 and -26 parts per thousand). There was a tendency for the nitrogen isotopic composition of seagrass and macroalgae to become lighter from the southern to the northern Red Sea, in parallel to a decline in nitrogen concentration in the tissues, indicative of a higher dependence of nitrogen fixation as a source of nitrogen toward the more oligotrophic northern Red Sea. Our results showed an overlap in the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between macroalgae and seagrasses; however, their delta D values were significantly different (seagrasses -56.6 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand and macroalgae -95.7 +/- 3.4 parts per thousand). This remarkable difference offers a promising alternative for ecological studies where a similar range of isotopic values could mask different potential sources.

AB  - In this work we evaluated the effect of the burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata on the soil quality and on the cordgrass Spartina densiflora in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Argentina, 37 degrees 32' S, 57 degrees 19' W). Soil hardness and percolation rates were higher outside the crab inhabited area than inside, and soil profiles showed 2 different strata in areas without crabs. Crabs were associated with low soil water content, a higher variability in pH, and a homogeneous distribution of organic matter. Meiofaunal abundance was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. The water content of aboveground structures of S. densiflora was lower inside the crab populated areas. Leaf survival was lower inside the area inhabited by crabs than outside. In areas with new shoots (after burning by a brush fire) crabs depleted the aboveground plant structures. A caging experiment showed that crabs decreased leaf survival by herbivory. During the experiment, substrata was covered by sediment displaced by crabs, and the area showed less soil hardness and lower percolation rates than controls. Crabs decreased water content and organic matter on upper sediment layers. Meiofaunal abundance (arachnids and insects) was higher in control plots (without crabs) than in treatment plots. A field selection experiment showed that crabs decreased survival of young stems, but did not affect old stems. All this evidence suggests that C, granulata affects cordgrass production by herbivory on new shoots, and can change the physical characteristics of the environment, which may also indirectly affect S. densiflora production. Thus, the general belief that in Spartina marshes only a small proportion of primary production is consumed in situ may not apply to SW Atlantic Spartina marshes inhabited by crabs.

We have investigated the relationships between stocks of different soil organic carbon (SOC) along the soil vertical profile and invasive plant success in a China wetland. In stands dominated by the exotic invasive species Spartina alterniflora and the native invasive Phragmites australis soil organic-carbon concentrations (SOC) were higher (12% and 9%, respectively) than in plots of a native species, Cyperus malaccensis, whereas SOC content (g m(-2) ) was 18% and 17% lower under P. australis than under S. alterniffolia and C. malaccensis, respectively. Soils under both invasive species had the concentrations and contents of light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC), light-fraction organic nitrogen (LFON) at 30-60 cm of soil depth and labile organic carbon (LOC) concentrations at 0-10 cm higher than soils under native species. The invasive species had higher total aboveground, total biomasses and lower shoot:root ratios than the native species. The success of both invasive species was associated with higher growth rates and accumulation of nutrients in biomass than in the native species and also accumulation of C in plant soil system. The stands currently dominated by the invasive species were recently occupied by monospecific stands of the native C. malaccensis, strongly suggesting that all or most of the current soil differences were due to the invasions. Higher sand fraction in C. malaccensis community and higher clay fraction in P. australis community relative to the native species, were correlated with higher soil N and P concentrations in invaded stands. The results suggest that different vegetation cover with distinct shoot/root ratio can change soil structure by favoring sedimentation of different particle size classes. Thus, despite both invasive species have some common traits, the results also showed that different invasive species with partially distinct impacts on soil and nutrient uses can succeed under the same conditions. The traits conferring invasive success are thus not necessarily species-specific. A clear change in the general accumulation of C, N and P in the plant-soil system was related to the invasive plant success in this wetland areas.

AB  - Polyamines are short-chain aliphatic compounds containing multiple amine groups. They are important components of the cytosol of eukaryotes and are present at mmol L-1 concentrations inside phytoplankton cells, while complex polyamines play a role in biosilica deposition. Concentrations of polyamines measured in seawater are typically in the sub-nmol L-1 range, implying rapid and efficient uptake by osmotrophs, likely bacterioplankton. We measured turnover rates of three polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) using H-3-labeled compounds and determined their concentrations by HPLC to estimate polyamine contributions to dissolved organic matter and bacterioplankton carbon and nitrogen demand. These measurements were made on transects from the inner shelf to the Gulf Stream across the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) during April and October of 2011 and in salt marsh estuaries on the Georgia coast during August of 2011 and April of 2012. We found that turnover rates of polyamines were similar to those of amino acids (arginine and glutamic acid) measured in the same samples; however, fluxes of polyamines into bacterioplankton were much lower than amino acid fluxes as a result of low ambient concentrations. Turnover rates and fluxes of polyamines decreased from near-shore waters to the shelf-break, following the pattern of chlorophyll a concentration. Polyamine uptake accounted for less than 10 % of bacterial N demand and 5 % of bacterial C demand on average, with a large variation among water masses.

AB  - A 20 m section of calcareous, fine- to coarse-grained Holocene sediments forming the upper part of the Garding-2 core, taken near Garding on the Eiderstedt Peninsula in Northwest Germany, has been analysed for pollen and for its sedimentological and geochemical characteristics to reconstruct the Holocene environmental history of this coastal area.
   The studied sediment sequence was deposited above an unconformity at 20 m depth formed by major erosion due to the rapid sea-level rise in the Early Holocene. A thin layer of marine sediments at the base, possibly correlating to the late Atlantic, is unconformably overlain by marine-tidal flat deposits up to 11.00 m depth. The Subboreal age of these deposits is evidenced by the first occurrence of Fagus at 15.97 m, which is OSL-dated, at 16.22 m, to about 3130 +/- 260 BP (Zhang et al. 2014) and Carpinus at 15.03 m. The Ulmus decline, a palynological characteristic marking the Atlantic to Subboreal transition in northwestern Europe, is not revealed in the pollen sequence. Ulmus shows low values throughout the entire pollen diagram. It is therefore assumed that late Atlantic transitional sediments were eroded in Garding-2.
   Sandy sediments between about 11.00 m and the top of the sequence are palynologically characterised by increased representation of local salt marsh, dune and tidal flat vegetation, indicated by the abundance of Poaceae, Cerealia-type pollen, probably derived mainly from wild grasses, and increased percentages of Ericaceae, Cyperaceae and Chenopodiaceae. These upper deposits are AMS C-14-dated to 2790 +/- 20 BP (at 11.41 m) and 1820 +/- 50 BP (at 2.70 m; Zhang et al. 2014) suggesting an early Subatlantic age. Due to regional features and peculiarities of the coastal environment, significant anthropogenic impact on landscape as well as the expansion of Fagus and Carpinus, characteristic for the Subboreal to Subatlantic transition at about 2700 BP in Northern Germany, are not clearly reflected in the pollen diagram.

AB  - N-15 was used in a 7-yr field study and a laboratory investigation of a single growing season to quantify the amount, timing, and mechanisms of annual N retention and loss in the plant-sediment system of a short Spartina alterniflora marsh. There was an initial rapid loss of similar to 25% of the added (NH4+)-N-15 through nitrification-denitrification at a rate of 25.2 mg N m(-2) d(-1), with the remaining label being incorporated into plant tissues. Label losses decreased throughout the study as N-15 was increasingly sequestered in the dead organic N pool. About 40% of the injected label remained after seven growing seasons. Total annual N losses were 7.3-7.6 g N m(-2) yr(-1) based on N-15 losses and estimates of the actively cycling N pool. Export accounted for 26-44% and denitrification for 54-77% of the total N loss. Burial of N in dead belowground organic matter was 3.7-4.1 g N m(-2) yr(-1), similar to estimates determined from accretion and total sediment N data. Recycling of N through translocation from aboveground to belowground biomass and remineralization of dead belowground biomass was the major pathway in the sediment N cycle, equivalent to 67-79% of the annual plant N demand. Annual N losses were balanced by inputs, primarily N, fixation. Long-term N retention appears to be controlled primarily by the competition for DIN between the plants and bacterial nitrifiers-denitrifiers and secondarily by the relative incorporation of N into aboveground vs. belowground biomass.

AB  - Plant invasion has been reported to modify ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes and pools. The aims of this work were to identify the consequences of plant invasion on C and N dynamics in soil organic matter (SOM) and its fractions following invasion chronosequence. In this study, we investigated the soil C and N contents and the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the SOM, free light fraction (LF), infra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) and mineral-associated organic matter (mSOM) in invasive 6-, 10-, 17- and 20-year-old Spartina alterniflora communities and compared with bare flat land in a coastal wetland of eastern China. S. alternifiora invasion significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) contents in SOM fractions compared with the bare flat land. The SOC, iPOM-C and iPOM-N progressively increased, but the SON, mSOM-C and mSOM-N did not significantly change following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The proportion of C in iPOM gradually increased, whereas that in mSOM decreased following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence except for the 20-year-old S. alterniflora soil. The highest proportion of S. alterniflora-derived C in SOM and its fractions was found in 17-year-old soil covered by S. alternifiora. The decay rate of old C decreased and the mean residence time of C increased in SOM and its fractions following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence. The delta N-15 values of soil under S. alterniflora were more enriched than were those in bare flat land, whereas the delta N-15 values depleted following invasion chronosequence. Our results show that S. alterniflora invasion significantly altered SOC dynamics following invasion chronosequence by changing C physical distribution in SOM, S. alterniflora-derived C input and C decomposition, ultimately having a greater impact on SOC incorporation relative to SON accumulation in a coastal wetland of eastern China.

AB  - Modes of colonization, the successional trajectory, and trophic recovery of a macrofaunal community were analyzed over 19 months in the Friendship marsh, a 20-acre restored wetland in Tijuana Estuary, California. Traditional techniques for quantifying macrofaunal communities were combined with emerging stable isotopic approaches for evaluation of trophic recovery, making comparisons with a nearby natural Spartina foliosa habitat. Life history-based predictions successfully identified major colonization modes, although most taxa employed a variety of tactics for colonizing the restored marsh. The presence of S.foliosa did not seem to affect macrofaunal colonization or succession at the scale of this study. However, soil organic matter content in the restored marsh was positively correlated with insect densities, and high initial salinities may have limited the success of early colonists. Total macrofaunal densities recovered to natural marsh levels after 14 months and diversity, measured as species richness and the Shannon index (H'), was comparable to the natural marsh by 19 months. Some compositional disparities between the natural and created communities persisted after 19 months, including lower percentages of surface-feeding polychaetes (Polydora spp.) and higher percentages of dipteran insects and turbellarians in the Friendship marsh. As surficial structural similarity of infaunal communities between the Friendship and natural habitat was achieved, isotopic analyses revealed a simultaneous trajectory towards recovery of trophic structure. Enriched delta(13)C signatures of benthic microalgae and infauna, observed in the restored marsh shortly after establishment compared to natural Spartina habitat, recovered after 19 months. However, the depletion in delta(15)N signatures of macrofauna in the Friendship marsh indicated consumption of microalgae, particularly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, while macroalgae and Spartina made a larger contribution to macrofaunal diets in the natural habitat. Future successional studies must continue to develop and employ novel combinations of techniques for evaluating structural and functional recovery of disturbed and created habitats.

AB  - The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta's (Delta) beneficial uses for humans and wildlife are impaired by elevated methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in fish. MeHg is a neurotoxin that bioaccumulates in aquatic food webs. The total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation plan aimed at reducing MeHg in Delta fish obligates dischargers to conduct MeHg control studies. Over 150 stakeholders collaborated to identify 24 management practices (MPs) addressing MeHg nonpoint sources (NPS) in three categories: biogeochemistry (6), hydrology (14), and soil/vegetation (4). Land uses were divided into six categories: permanently and seasonally flooded wetlands, flooded and irrigated agricultural lands, floodplains, and brackish-fresh tidal marshes. Stakeholders scored MPs based on seven criteria: scientific certainty, costs, MeHg reduction potential, spatial applicability, technical capacity to implement, negative impacts to beneficial uses, and conflicting requirements. Semi-quantitative scoring for MPs applicable to each land use (totaling > 400 individual scores) led to consensus-based prioritization. This process relied on practical experience from diverse and accomplished NPS stakeholders and synthesis of 17 previous studies. Results provide a comprehensive, stakeholder-driven prioritization of MPs for wetland and irrigated agricultural land managers. Final prioritization highlights the most promising MPs for practical application and control study, and a secondary set of MPs warranting further evaluation. MPs that address hydrology and soil/vegetation were prioritized because experiences were positive and implementation appeared more feasible. MeHg control studies will need to address the TMDL conundrum that MPs effective at reducing MeHg exports could both exacerbate MeHg exposure and contend with other management objectives on site.

AB  - High frequency dissolved oxygen data were analyzed to calculate primary production, respiration and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) from 42 sites within 22 National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR), 1995-2000. NERR sites are characterized by a variety of dominant plant communities including phytoplankton, salt marsh, seagrass, macroalgae, freshwater macrophyte, and mangrove, and are representative of the coastal bioregions of the United States. As expected from the wide diversity of sites, metabolic rates were temporally and spatially variable with the highest production and respiration occurring during the summer in Southeastern estuaries. Sites within different regions exhibited consistent seasonal trends in production, respiration, and NEM. Temperature was the most important environmental factor explaining within-site variation in metabolic rates; nutrient concentrations were the second most important factor. All but three of the 42 sites were heterotrophic (respiration was greater than production) on an annual basis. Habitat adjacent to the monitoring site, estuarine area, and salinity explained 58% of the variation in NEM. Open water sites or sites adjacent to mangroves or in marsh creeks were heterotrophic, while sites in or adjacent to submerged aquatic vegetation (eelgrass or macroalgal beds) were either autotrophic or near balance. Estuarine area was also a significant factor explaining variabitity in NEM; larger systems were closer to balance than smaller systems that trended toward heterotrophy. Freshwater sites were more heterotrophic than saline sites. Nutrient loading explained 68% of the variation in NEM among some of the sites. When these estimates were compared to the literature, metabolic rates from the NERR sites were much larger, often two to five times greater than rates from other estuarine and coastal systems. One explanation is that these small, generally shallow sites located near shore may have greater allochthonous organic inputs as well as significant benthic primary production than the large, deeper systems represented by the literature.

AB  - Humic sulfur, operationally defined as the sulfur extracted with humic substances in 0.1 N NaOH solution, comprises up to 51% of the total sulfur inventory in a sediment core taken from a Delaware Spartina alterniflora marsh.  Pyrite sulfur is the next largest fraction, except at the near-surface sediments, where zerovalent sulfur concentrations are significant.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the humic sulfur consists of sulfoxides or sulfones and, in a more reduced state, organic sulfides and/or organic polysulfides.  A subsurface decreases in the humic acid C:S atomic ratio to 56 +/- 2 suggests that the upper 4 cm of marsh sediment is the locus for humic sulfur formation.  S. alterniflora detritus and microbial biomass cannot fully account for observed sulfur enrichment of humic C:S atomic ratios.  Therefore, the enrichment of humic substances by sulfur is probably via reaction of reduced sulfur compounds with organic matter.  A humic sulfur formation rate of 10.6-mu-mol S.cm-3.a-1 is calculated for the surface sediments and leads to an areal production of 18-mu-mol S.cm-2.a-1 of humic sulfur.  Humic sulfur formation and preservation is enhanced by the limited availability of iron for the rapid precipitation of iron sulfide minerals and the apparent resistance of organic sulfur compounds towards reoxidation to sulfate, especially in the upper 9 cm of marsh sediment where inorganic sulfur compounds are rapidly oxidized.

AB  - Oxygen measurements of soil air were carried out to determine daily variations and seasonality of oxygen in soil air and their dependence on ambient parameters such as groundwater chemistry, hydrodynamics and physico-chemical sediment characteristics. Two field sites in the Doana National Park were equipped with fibre-optic oxygen- and temperature sensors down to 6 m below the groundsurface, and oxygen was sampled from November 2010 until July 2012. One of the sites lies in the saltmarshes and the other in the dune belt, so providing coverage of contrasting hydrogeochemical conditions. Sediments from both locations were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters. Furthermore, groundwater levels were measured and samples taken for hydrochemical analysis. Soil gas in the salt marsh ranged from anaerobic conditions during the wet season to aerobic conditions in the dry period, which is related to the anaerobic groundwater and the high amount of electron donors in the sediment. The location in the dune belt yielded aerobic conditions throughout the year due to the minor amount of organic carbon in the sediments and the high oxygen content of the groundwater. The oxygen time series exhibits daily oscillations related to microbiological activity in the root zone of the Juniperus Sabina tree.

AB  - Horseshoe crabs are valued for economic, ecological, and educational purposes. These values have raised interest in managing natural stocks and culturing crabs for conservation, research, and education. To inform these efforts, we used N and C stable isotopes to define the natural diet of juvenile horseshoe crabs and then assessed effects of different diets on growth and survival of juveniles in culture. In the natural environment, N and C isotope ratios in juvenile horseshoe crabs changed as crabs grew, with larger crabs consuming larger prey. Linear mixing analyses suggested young crabs were supported by high quantities of benthic and suspended particulate organic matter (POM), shifting between marine algae and salt marsh-based food webs, depending on size. In culture, we tested the relative importance of algae, as a proxy for POM, in horseshoe crab diet by feeding juvenile crabs different percentages of algae and prey animals. Initially,juvenile crabs showed a significant increase in size when fed diets >70% protein, but showed a decrease in survival compared to algae-rich diets. Overall, growth rates and survival declined through time during the 128-day study, regardless of diet composition. These data Suggest horseshoe crabs require foods from a combination of plant and animal sources. Successful culture or conservation of horseshoe crabs will depend on understanding the relative importance of different food sources at different life stages as well as discerning the balance between factors that increase growth, but reduce survival.

AB  - This research examines the relationships between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), water level, precipitation patterns and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange rates in the freshwater wetland ecosystems of the Florida Everglades. Data was obtained over a 5-year study period (2009-2013) from two freshwater marsh sites located in Everglades National Park that differ in hydrology. At the short-hydroperiod site (Taylor Slough; TS) and the long-hydroperiod site (Shark River Slough; SRS) fluctuations in precipitation patterns occurred with changes in ENSO phase, suggesting that extreme ENSO phases alter Everglades hydrology which is known to have a substantial influence on ecosystem carbon dynamics. Variations in both ENSO phase and annual net CO2 exchange rates co-occurred with changes in wet and dry season length and intensity. Combined with site-specific seasonality in CO2 exchanges rates, El Nino and La Nina phases magnified season intensity and CO2 exchange rates at both sites. At TS, net CO2 uptake rates were higher in the dry season, whereas SRS had greater rates of carbon sequestration during the wet season. As La Nina phases were concurrent with drought years and extended dry seasons, TS became a greater sink for CO2 on an annual basis (-11 to -110 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to El Nino and neutral years (-5 to -43.5 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). SRS was a small source for CO2 annually (1.81 to 80 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)) except in one exceptionally wet year that was associated with an El Nino phase (-16 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1)). Considering that future climate predictions suggest a higher frequency and intensity in El Nino and La Nina phases, these results indicate that changes in extreme ENSO phases will significantly alter CO2 dynamics in the Florida Everglades.

AB  - Diversion of the Mississippi River is considered the most effective way of offsetting Louisiana's coastal plain land loss. The Wax Lake delta, a man-made diversion that represents mostly sand-rich distributary mouth bar deposits, is cited as a model for land building from a large river diversion. The fine-grained suspended load is mostly deposited outside of "the delta." Numerical simulations of diversion delta building focus primarily on sand deposition. The fine-grained suspended load is only secondarily considered. Research results reported here suggest that natural processes associated with the synergistic relationship between floods and cold front passages can effectively distribute suspended sediments to maintain and rebuild wetlands outside the sand-rich delta. Measurements (fixed acoustic Doppler current profilers) of current speed, current direction, and water level in a mainland marsh channel, north of Atchafalaya Bay, indicate that as cold fronts approach, local water levels can be elevated by as much as 1 m, and normal discharge into the bay is reversed so that flow is into the coastal plain marshes. LIDAR bank elevations indicate that overbank flow is initiated by these events. Streamside sediment accretion (2-y monitoring period) using feldspar plots indicates up to 6.8 cm. Longer term Cs-137 data reveal an average sediment accretion rate of >1 cm y(-1) over 50+ years. Marsh flooding results in denitrification of nitrate in river water plus nutrient uptake resulting in increased plant productivity, considerably greater than for similar coastal plain marshes free of riverine sediment input. Fine-grained suspended sediments are important for rebuilding Louisiana's coastal plain, which is naturally constructed mostly of riverine silt and clay plus organic matter.

AB  - We studied relationships among sediment variables (carbon content, C:N, hardness, oxygen penetration, silt-clay fraction), hydrologic variables (dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, transparency, water depth), sizes and biomass of common invertebrate classes, and densities of 15 common waterbird species in ponds of impounded freshwater, oligohaline, mesohaline, and unimpounded mesohaline marshes during winters 1997-98 to 1999-2000 on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, USA. Canonical correspondence analysis and forward selection was used to analyze the above variables. Water depth and oxygen penetration were the variables that best segregated habitat characteristics that resulted in maximum densities of common waterbird species. Most common waterbird species were associated with specific marsh types, except Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca) and Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeala). We concluded that hydrologic manipulation of marsh ponds is the best way to manage habitats for these birds, if the hydrology can be controlled adequately.

AB  - The dominance of a plant species in highly metal-contaminated areas reflects its tolerance or adaptability potential to these scenarios. Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal).
   Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500A degrees C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60A degrees C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis.
   P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited a parts per thousand 5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0.03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0.14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well.

AB  - Lithostratigraphic studies in north-central Fenland reveal the occurrence of a silty clay unit separating fen peat deposits from saltmarsh clayey silt deposits. Lithological and organic carbon data show gradual transitions from the underlying fen and to the overlying saltmarsh palaeoenvironments. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate pedogenic alteration of the deposits substantiated by percentage carbonate carbon data. Palynological data reveal a development from Betula carr to saltmarsh via an intermediate environment with pollen and spores derived from both seaward and landward facies. Analysis and interpretation suggest that the silty clay unit was deposited in a brackish open water habitat as a result of freshwater and tidal pending behind the saltmarsh. The evidence suggest the existence of a previously unrecorded successional environment between coastal reedswamp and saltmarsh facies. This environment occurred in broad, shallow gradient coastal settings during periods of rapid saltmarsh growth. No modem comparable environment exists due to the effect of drainage and sea defence schemes. Comparison is made with other sites within Fenland.

AB  - Increased residential development in coastal watersheds has led to increases in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into estuaries. Sessile bivalves are good candidate organisms to examine nitrogen enrichment effects on consumers because they contribute significantly to material transport from pelagic to benthic systems. We examined condition index (CI), individual dry weight, density, and total biomass in the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn), from 10 marsh sites within Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, subject to varying watershed sub-basin nitrogen loadings. We tested hypotheses that condition and population attributes of G. demissa are driven by watershed sub-basin nitrogen load. There was no clear relationship between the mussel Cl and nitrogen load. G, demissa density and total biomass did increase significantly with increases in nitrogen load. Responses in individual mussel dry weight might be an indirect effect of increased nitrogen loading due to eutrophication-induced changes in food availability. Increased nitrogen loads could be increasing G. demissa food sources, such as Spartina alterniflora detritus, microheterotrophs, particulate organic matter, or phytoplankton, that subsequently translate into higher G. demissa growth and reproduction.

AB  - The prospective rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature may change the distribution and invasive potential of a species; and intraspecific invasive lineages may respond differently to climate change. In this study, we simulated a future climate scenario with simultaneously elevated atmospheric CO2 and temperature, and investigated its interaction with soil salinity, to assess the effects of global change on the ecophysiology of two competing haplotypes of the wetland grass Phragmites australis, that are invasive in the coastal marshes of North America. The two haplotypes with the phenotypes EU-type' (Eurasian haplotype) and Delta-type' (Mediterranean haplotype), were grown at 0 parts per thousand and 20 parts per thousand soil salinity, and at ambient or elevated climatic conditions (700ppm CO2, +5 degrees C) in a phytotron system. The aboveground growth of both phenotypes was highest at the elevated climatic conditions. Growth at 20 parts per thousand salinity resulted in declined aboveground growth, lower transpiration rates (E), stomata conductance (g(s)), specific leaf area, photosynthetic pigment concentrations, and a reduced photosynthetic performance. The negative effects of salinity were, however, significantly less severe at elevated CO2 and temperature than at the ambient climatic conditions. The Delta-type P. australis had higher shoot elongation rates than the EU-type P. australis, particularly at high salinity. The Delta-type also had higher maximum light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (A(sat)), maximum carboxylation rates of Rubisco (V-cmax), maximum electron transport rates (J(max)), triose phosphate utilization rates (T-p), stomata conductance (g(s)), as well as higher Rubisco carboxylation-limited, RuBP regeneration-limited and T-p-regeneration limited CO2 assimilation rates than the EU-type under all growth conditions. Our results suggest that the EU-type will not become dominant over the Delta-type, since the Delta-type has superior ecophysiological traits. However, the projected rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature will alleviate the effects of salinity on both phenotypes and facilitate their expansion into more saline areas.

AB  - The impact of salt-water intrusion on microbial organic carbon (C) mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) soils was investigated in a year-long laboratory experiment in which intact soils were exposed to a simulated tidal cycle of freshwater or dilute salt-water. Gas fluxes [carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)], rates of microbial processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis), and porewater and solid phase biogeochemistry were measured throughout the experiment. Flux rates of CO2 and, surprisingly, CH4 increased significantly following salt-water intrusion, and remained elevated relative to freshwater cores for 6 and 5 months, respectively. Following salt-water intrusion, rates of sulfate reduction increased significantly and remained higher than rates in the freshwater controls throughout the experiment. Rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were higher than rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but the rates did not differ by salinity treatment. Soil organic C content decreased significantly in soils experiencing salt-water intrusion. Estimates of total organic C mineralized in freshwater and salt-water amended soils over the 1-year experiment using gas flux measurements (18.2 and 24.9 mol C m(-2), respectively) were similar to estimates obtained from microbial rates (37.8 and 56.2 mol C m(-2), respectively), and to losses in soil organic C content (0 and 44.1 mol C m(-2), respectively). These findings indicate that salt-water intrusion stimulates microbial decomposition, accelerates the loss of organic C from TFM soils, and may put TFMs at risk of permanent inundation.

AB  - The concentrations of several trace elements and iron were determined in 26 soil samples from Belyi Island in the Kara Sea (West Siberian sector of Russian Arctic). The major types of soils predominating in the soil cover were sampled. The concentrations of trace elements (mg kg(-1)) varied within the following ranges: 119-561 for Mn, 9.5-126 for Zn, 0.082-2.5 for Cd, <0.5-19.2 for Cu, <0.5-132 for Pb, 0.011-0.081 for Hg, <0.5-10.3 for Co, and 7.6-108 for Cr; the concentration of Fe varied from 3943 to 37,899 mg kg-1. The impact of particular soil properties (pH, carbon and nitrogen contents, particle-size distribution) on metal concentrations was analyzed by the methods of correlation, cluster, and factor analyses. The correlation analysis showed that metal concentrations are negatively correlated with the sand content and positively correlated with the contents of silt and clay fractions. The cluster analysis allowed separation of the soils into three clusters. Cluster I included the soils with the high organic matter content formed under conditions of poor drainage; cluster II, the low-humus sandy soils of the divides and slopes; and cluster III, saline soils of coastal marshes. It was concluded that the geomorphic position largely controls the soil properties. The obtained data were compared with data on metal concentrations in other regions of the Russian Arctic. In general, the concentrations of trace elements in the studied soils were within the ranges typical of the background Arctic territories. However, some soils of Belyi Island contained elevated concentrations of Pb and Cd.

AB  - Sulfur isotope fractionation during microbial sulfate reduction in brackish estuarine sediments was studied using an experimental flow-through reactor approach designed to preserve the in situ physical, geochemical and microbial structure of the sediment. Concurrent measurements of potential sulfate reduction rates and S-34/S-32 fractionations were carried out using intact sediment slices (2 cm thick, 4.2 cm diameter) from unvegetated, intertidal sites adjoining a salt marsh along the Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands. A total of 30 reactor experiments were performed with sediments collected in February, May and October 2006. The effects of incubation temperature (10, 20, 30 and 50 degrees C) and sediment depth (0-2, 4-6 and 8-10 cm) were investigated. Sulfate was supplied in non-limiting concentrations via the reactor inflow solutions; no external electron donor was supplied. Isotope fractionations (epsilon values) were calculated from the measured differences in sulfate delta S-34 between in-and outflow solutions of the reactors, under quasi-steady state conditions. Potential sulfate reduction rates (SRR) varied over one order of magnitude (5-49 nmol cm(-3) h(-1)) and were highest in the 30 degrees C incubations. They decreased systematically with depth, and were highest in the sediments collected closest to the vegetated marsh. Isotope fractionations ranged from 9 parts per thousand to 34 parts per thousand and correlated inversely with SRR, as predicted by the standard fractionation model for enzymatic sulfate reduction of Rees (1973). The epsilon versus SRR relationship, however, varied between sampling times, with higher e values measured in February, at comparable SRRs, than in May and October. The observed epsilon versus SRR relationships also deviated from the previously reported inverse trend for sediments collected in a marine lagoon in Denmark (Canfield, 2001b). Thus, isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction is not uniquely determined by SRR, but is site-and time-dependent. Factors that may affect the epsilon versus SRR relationship include the structure and size of the sulfate-reducing community, and the nature and accessibility of organic substrates. Whole-sediment data such as those presented here provide a link between isotopic fractionations measured with pure cultures of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes and sulfur isotopic signatures recorded in sedimentary deposits.

AB  - Groundwater tables and soil salinity can greatly affect the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen by altering soil physicochemical properties. Coastal wetlands with different plant cover types (including bare land, Phragmites australis, and Suaeda salsa wetlands) and groundwater table wetlands (including low groundwater table, medium groundwater table, and high groundwater table wetlands) were investigated in 2012-2013 to characterize the spatial and temporal changes and the effects of groundwater tables on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the Yellow River Estuary, China. The results showed that SOCs in 2012 was higher than that in 2013 regardless of the groundwater tables, while TNs was higher in 2013 than in 2012 except in the BL soil with low groundwater tables and the PA wetlands with middle groundwater tables. The SOCc and TNc were mainly concentrated in the top 20 cm soils. SOC. and TNc were fitted very well with soil depth by the general linear fit (p < 0.01). The Lorentz models were ideal for the relationships among SOC, TN and electrical conductivity (EC), indicating that certain EC values could improve carbon and nitrogen accumulation. The theoretical threshold of EC for the maximum SOC and SOCs was 2.2 ms/cm, and the maximum TN and TNs highly depended on groundwater tables (0.9-1.0 ms/cm for LW, 1.6-1.8 ms/cm for MW and 3.0 ms/cm for HW). The general linear model results showed that SOC was positively correlated with TN at the same groundwater table (p < 0.01). Additionally, a positive linear relationship was also observed among SOC, TN and silt + clay contents for all groundwater tables (p < 0.05). These findings indicated that carbon and nitrogen stocks might be regulated by groundwater tables and salinity to improve carbon sinks in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Many subtropical coastal wetland vegetation communities are transitioning from herbaceous marsh to woody mangrove, often facilitated by sea-level rise. This study investigated the relationships between vegetation community (upstream marsh, ecotone/transition, and downstream mangrove), salinity (S), and soil biogeochemistry in wetlands along three rivers on the Florida Gulf coast (the Little Manatee, Peace, and Fakahatchee Rivers). Vegetation was surveyed, and soil and water samples were collected during both the dry and the wet season and analyzed for biogeochemical properties (soil: bulk density, pH, organic matter, extractable inorganic and total nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon; water: inorganic nutrients and DOC) and processes (greenhouse gas production) while salinity and water level were continuously monitored in the field. Results indicated landscape-scale patterns in soil biogeochemistry differed significantly by river and were most strongly correlated with soil organic matter content, regardless of vegetation community or salinity regime. Contrary to expectations, soil organic matter content gradients were not always inversely related to salinity gradients, and methane production was observed in moderate-(S = 12) and high-(S = 34) salinity mangrove communities. The vegetation ecotone experienced seasonally variable salinity and did not serve as a true biogeochemical intermediate between the marsh and mangrove communities. This study demonstrates the need for site-specific studies of biogeochemical gradients in coastal wetlands and indicates the marsh-to mangrove ecotone is not a proxy for salinity or biogeochemical tipping points. Instead, soil organic matter content is suggested as the most relevant indicator of biogeochemical properties and processes in wetlands along coastal rivers, superseding vegetation community or salinity.

AB  - Mild winter temperatures are facilitating the expansion of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) into smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico. These expansions have the potential to alter soil development because of differences in productivity and tissue chemistry between Spartina and Avicennia. Here, we examined changes in soil-nutrient chemistry at 2-cm intervals in 30-cm soil cores collected from Spartina and Avicennia habitats at two different sites in Fourchon, Louisiana. Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 2009, our chronology shows that the species shift had no effect on bulk density (mean +/- standard error [SE]: 0.68 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3)), organic matter (mean +/- SE: 8.36 +/- 0.29 %), or nitrogen content (mean +/- SE: 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg cm(-3)). Phosphorus densities were significantly greater in Avicennia habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.32 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)) than they were in Spartina habitats (mean +/- SE: 0.28 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-3)), which we attributed to Avicennia occurring at higher elevations in more oxidizing soils. We observed significant variability with depth (proxy for time) and between sites in all soil properties measured. This variability can be attributed to the dominance of allochthonous sediment deposition from natural and anthropogenic disturbances compared with the lesser influence of vegetation on autochthonous soil development. In the highly disturbed region of Fourchon, Louisiana, the shift from Spartina marshes to scrub Avicennia stands does not appear to affect the chemistry of soil development.

AB  - The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 +/- 19.13 gC m(-2) y(-1)) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 +/- 100.6 gCO(2) eq(-1) m(-2) y(-1)). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.

AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems such as saltmarshes and seagrasses are important sinks of organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN), with large global and local variability, driven by the confluence of many physical and ecological factors. Here we show that sedimentary OC and TN stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for OC and TN burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39-68%). This is the second estimate of OC stocks and the first of OC burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of OC stocks (29-99 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (15-122 g m(2) y(-1)) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The TN stocks (7-11 Mg ha(-1)) and burial rates (2-4 g m(-2) y(-1)) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The OC and TN stocks (29-101 and 3-11 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and burial rates (19-39 and 3-5 g m(-2) y(-1)) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.

AB  - The responses to human perturbations of the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) in the global coastal ocean were evaluated using a process-based model. In this model, the global coastal ocean is represented by two distinct zones: the proximal zone which includes large bays, the open water part of estuaries, deltas, inland seas, and salt marshes; and the distal zone which includes the open continental shelves down to a depth of 200 m. The biogeochemical model of the elemental cycles in the coastal ocean describes the dynamics of transfer processes and their interactions (primary production, mineralization, sediment deposition, and burial). The coastal sediment submodel describes element recycling in the sediments and allows the assessment of the evolution of denitrification under various environmental forcings. Initial values for the biogeochemical fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen between the various reservoirs of the coastal ocean and the exchange of materials at the boundaries with the rivers and the open ocean are estimated based on current literature data. Before anthropogenic activities, the global coastal ocean was a net autotrophic system with a net export flux to sediments and open ocean of 20 Tmol organic C/yr. The magnitude and direction of this net flux is strongly dependent on the flux of organic carbon from the coastal ocean to adjacent reservoirs. The proximal coastal region was slightly heterotrophic at 8.4 Tmol C/yr, consistent with estimates by other authors; the distal coastal ocean was autotrophic at the rate of 28.4 Tmol C/yr. To simulate the evolution of the coastal ocean under human influence during the past 50 yr, the global coastal ocean model was perturbed by increasing the global riverine fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and total organic matter (TOM) and the depositional flux of atmospheric nitrogen relative to the preanthropogenic condition. Model results show that over the past 50 yr, primary production in the coastal ocean has doubled, and resulted in an accumulation of biomass in all compartments of the system. The coastal ocean became more heterotrophic in response to the dominant perturbation of the increased flux of terrestrial organic matter via the rivers. Contrary to expectations, denitrification rates do not increase and the denitrification. efficiency of the coastal ocean system decreases. This suggests that the coastal ocean is not likely to self-regulate the effects of human-induced perturbations on nutrient cycles. Finally, simulation results for a future condition where the rates of riverine organic and inorganic C and N inputs to the coastal ocean continue to increase at their current exponential growth patterns indicate that the proximal coastal ocean could become increasingly heterotrophic, the organic matter content could increase, and primary production could be enhanced. These changes could potentially cause noxious blooms to occur and become a generalized phenomenon of the proximal coastal ocean. There is a strong likelihood that unless human-derived inputs are regulated at the source, substantial biogeochemical modification of the global coastal ocean will occur because cyclic processes within the coastal ocean system are not rapid enough to dissipate the effects of the perturbations.

AB  - With immense impact on coastal ecosystems' function, especially on nutrient cycle, Spartina alterniflora has become the most importantly invasive species in coastal wetland of China. However, the alternation of sulfur level and transformation between different inorganic sulfur (IS) fractions caused by the plant are poorly understood. In order to study the effect of S. alterniflora invasion and growth on soil IS components, we used space for-time substitution method and examined a whole year dynamics of different sulfur components in 0-60 cm soil of S. alterniflora tidal flat and mudflat at Jiaozhou Bay. Results indicated S. alterniflora improved soil sulfur level and its bio-availability, increased the contents of soil TS, total inorganic sulfur (TIS) and all of the IS fractions except hydrochloric acid volatile sulfur (HVS). But only the rate of soil adsorbed sulfur (AS) to TIS raised following invasion. In addition, S. alterniflora elevated the accumulation sites of soil Hydrochloric acid soluble sulfur (HSS) and HVS from deep soil to rhizosphere in spring. Key impact factors on IS fractions altered as invasion from soil physicochemical factors to plant fctors. Further, S. alterniflora encouraged the transformation of sulfur state from precipitation (HSS, HVS) to dissolved (HS, AS). This implies that the plant induced to an elevation of sulfur provided capacity and a reduction of sulfur toxicity in soil, which has vitally ecological significance for its expansion in costal wetlands. Now, S. alterniflora has occupied large area mudflat and was competing for habitat with native species in Jiaozhou Bay.

AB  - The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (ambient + 340 mu mol mol(-1)) on above-ground litter decomposition were investigated over a 6-week period using a field-based mesocosm system. Soil respiratory activity in mesocosms incubated in ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were not significantly different (t-test, P > 0.05) indicating that there were no direct effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on litter decomposition.
   A study of the indirect effects of CO2 on soil respiration showed that soil mesocosms to which naturally senescent plant litter had been added (0.5% w/w) from the C-3 sedge Scirpus olneyi grown in elevated atmospheric CO2 was reduced by an average of 17% throughout the study when compared to soil mesocosms to which litter from Scirpus olneyi grown in ambient conditions had been added. In contrast, similar experiments using senescent material from the C-4 grass Spartina patens showed no difference in soil respiration rates between mesocosms to which litter from plants grown in elevated or ambient CO2 conditions had been added.
   Analysis of the C:N ratio and lignin content of the senescent material showed that, while the C:N ratio and lignin content of the Spartina patens litter did not vary with atmospheric CO2 conditions, the C:N ratio (but not the lignin content) of the litter from Scirpus olneyi was significantly greater (t-test; P < 0.05) when derived from plants grown under elevated CO2 (105:1 compared to 86:1 for litter derived from Scirpus olneyi grown under ambient conditions). The results suggest that the increased C:N ratio of the litter from the C-3 plant Scirpus olneyi grown under elevated CO2 led to the lower rates of biodegradation observed as reduced soil respiration in the mesocosms. Further longterm experiments are now required to determine the effects of elevated CO2 on C partitioning in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - We have applied sulfur speciation techniques to understand the chemistry and cycling of sulfur in Black Sea waters. The only reduced dissolved inorganic sulfur species detected (above the low minimum detection limits of the voltammetric methods employed) in the water column was hydrogen sulfide. The maximum concentration of sulfide (423-mu-M) is similar to previous reports. Using a cathodic stripping square wave voltammetry (CSSWV) method for nanomolar levels of sulfide, we determined the precise boundary between the "free" hydrogen sulfide (sulfidic) zone and the upper (oxic/suboxic) water column at the two stations studied. This boundary has apparently moved up by about 50 m in the past 20 years. Our results help demonstrate three chemically distinct zones of water in the central basin of the Black Sea: (1) the oxic [0-65 m], (2) the anoxic/nonsulfidic [65-100 m] and (3) the sulfidic [> 100 m].
   Sulfide bound to metals ("complexed" sulfide) is observed in both the oxic and anoxic/nonsulfidic zones of the water column. This supports previous studies on metal sulfide forms. From the electrochemical data, it is possible to estimate the strength of the complexation of sulfide to metals (log K = 10 to 11).
   Thiosulfate and sulfite were below our minimum detectable limit (MDL) of 50 nM using CSSWV. Elemental sulfur (MDL 5 nM) was detected below the onset of the hydrogen sulfide zone (90-100m) with a maximum of 30-60 nM near 120m. The sulfur speciation results for the Black Sea are lower by one order of magnitude or more than other marine systems such as the Cariaco Trench and salt marshes. New HPLC techniques were applied to detect thiols at submicromolar levels. The presence of thiols (2-mercaptoethylamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione) is correlated with the remineralization of organic matter at the oxic and anoxic/nonsulfidic interface.
   Water samples collected from the upper 50 m of the sulfidic zone showed significant sulfide oxidation on storage onboard ship even though they were filtered (0.2-mu-m) and handled to excluded oxygen contamination. Chemical additives such as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid prevented or retarded the sulfide loss. Thiosulfate and azide did not inhibit sulfide loss. These studies suggest an anaerobic chemical oxidation of sulfide rather than a biological oxidation on stored and filtered samples.

AB  - Sediment cores were analysed from four coastal wetland sites within the Minas Basin, Bay of Fundy to compare mercury speciation and sediment characteristics. The coastal wetland sediments were low in total mercury (mean = 17.4 +/- 9.9 ng g(-1)); however, MeHg concentration was 92 times higher (mean of 249 pg g(-1)) than intertidal mudflat sediment (mean of 2.7 pg g(-1)). Total mercury concentrations in intertidal mudflat cores were also low (0.5-23.7 ng g(-1)) and correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.98; p < 0.01) with % organic carbon; with low concentrations of MeHg present only below depths of 6 cm (mean = 2.7 +/- 1.0 pg g(-1)). Total mercury concentrations were negatively correlated (correlation = 0.56, p < 0.05) with inorganic sulphur (acid volatile sulphides (AVS) and pyrite) while MeHg concentrations were inversely correlated (Pearson correlation = -0.68; p < 0.05) with the pyrite content but not with AVS. Methyl mercury concentrations were not significantly correlated with organic carbon content in the wetland sediments, and mercury-in-biomass enrichment factors were lower (total mercury mean 1.5 +/- 1.9 and MeHg mean = 3.6 +/- 4.8) than published measurements from mercury polluted sites. Modelling estimates found on average 4.4 times more total mercury mass in the intertidal mudflat sediments relative to vegetated wetlands. A negative relationship was observed between MeHg concentrations (below 20 cm depth) and modelled tidal inundation. The mineral fraction within wetland sediments contained 96.2% of the total mercury mass; however, the highest concentrations of mercury species were in root biomass. This research confirms that vegetated coastal wetlands are key areas for formation of bioavailable methyl mercury, and mercury distribution is tied to organic carbon and sulphur speciation.

AB  - There is a growing concern about the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion via tidal rivers, streams, and creeks into tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) due to sea level rise (SLR) and intense and extended drought events. However, the magnitude and duration of porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 practical salinity units, psu) and the controlling factors remain unclear. In this study, we developed a TFFW soil porewater salinity model, in which the feedback mechanisms between soil salinity and evapotranspiration and hydraulic conductivity were incorporated. We selected sites (upper, middle, lower tidal freshwater forest sites, and oligohaline marsh site) along the coastal floodplains of two rivers, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA), that represent landscape salinity gradients from tidal influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The model results agreed well with field measurements and revealed that with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, the mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity (>2 psu) increased significantly compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services of TFFW even in the absence of SLR. Model results also showed more severe salinity stress under drought for the lower forest sites along the two rivers, where soil salinity values have already been at or in exceedance of the 2 psu threshold.
   Plain Language Summary Tidal freshwater forested wetlands (TFFW) provide valuable ecosystem services to society including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, water quality improvement, and habitat for critical wildlife species. However, TFFW are vulnerable to saltwater intrusion due to climate change-induced sea level rise (SLR) and extreme drought events. Salinity stress to TFFW is often reflected in elevated soil porewater salinity in exceedance of plant salinity stress threshold (2 psu). Soil porewater salinity magnitude and dynamics at sites along two coastal floodplains, the Waccamaw River (SC, USA) and the Savannah River (GA and SC, USA) exposed to drought-induced saltwater intrusion during 2008-2016 were studied using a physical and ecological process-driven soil salinity model. The mean annual soil porewater salinity and duration of elevated soil porewater salinity at TFFW sites increased significantly with drought-induced saltwater intrusion, even without SLR, compared to the normal (nondrought) condition, thus posing a threat to the health and ecosystem services in TFFW. Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator and the soil porewater salinity model can be used for predicting changes in the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of salinity stress to TFFW sites under future climate change.
   Key Points
   Drought-induced saltwater intrusion significantly increases soil porewater salinity in soils of tidal freshwater forested wetlands Tidal freshwater forest sites located near the tidal marsh boundary will suffer more severe salinity stress with climate change Soil porewater salinity is an effective ecological indicator for tidal freshwater forested wetland condition

AB  - The present study is an attempt to assess the effect of soil salinity and some other environmental factors on the plant community diversity in saline and marshy depressions of the western Mediterranean region of Egypt. The community diversity is negatively correlated with soil salinity and with the other related soil variables (clay, organic matter and water holding capacity). The habitat change, as a result of active sand deposition and process of hummock formation, also has a great impact on community diversity. The plant cover is negatively correlated with diversity. These findings are discussed in terms of adaptation theory.

AB  - According the latest predictions, an increase of about two times in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is expected to occur by the end of this century. In order to understand the effects of this atmospheric composition changes on two abundant Mediterranean halophytes (Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima), mesocosmos trials were performed simulating two atmospheric CO2 environments (380 ppm and 760 ppm of CO2 respectively). The two chosen halophyte species present different metabolic characteristics: H. portulacoides, is a C3 specie while S. maritima is a C-4 species. Distinct feedbacks were obtained for each of the studied species. Stable Isotope discrimination showed that both species showed an enhancement of the Rubisco carboxylation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency mostly due to an increase in intracellular [CO2]. In H. portulacoides CO2 fertilization induced an enhancement of ETR and a decrease in non-photochemical quenching and in dissipated energy fluxes. On the other hand the C-4 grass S. maritima, already at full capacity, showed no photosynthetic enhancement. In fact this highly productive grass presented lower photosynthetic efficiencies accompanied by increases in dissipated energy fluxes mostly due to reductions in energy flux associated with the transport of reducing power throughout the quinone pool. The accumulation of reducing power led to oxidative stress, and thus the photosynthetic ability of this grass was greatly reduced. Both these feedbacks to realistic future CO2 concentrations are important consideration for in future primary productivity models, indicating a possible reduced abundance of the pioneer S. maritima and an increased biomass spreading of the sediment stabilizer H. portulacoides, inevitably affecting the morphology and function of the salt marshes imposed by these atmospheric changes, both in terms of ecosystem functioning and loss of biodiversity.

AB  - Support for coastal wetland restoration projects that consider carbon (C) storage as a climate mitigation benefit is growing as coastal wetlands are sites of substantial C sequestration. However, the climate footprint of wetland restoration remains controversial as wetlands can also be large sources of methane (CH4). We quantify the vertical fluxes of C in restored fresh and oligohaline nontidal wetlands with managed hydrology and a tidal euhaline marsh in California's San Francisco Bay-Delta. We combine the use of eddy covariance atmospheric flux measurements with Pb-210-derived soil C accumulation rates to quantify the C sequestration efficiency of restored wetlands and their associated climate mitigation service. Nontidal managed wetlands were the most efficient in burying C on-site, with soil C accumulation rates as high as their net atmospheric C uptake (-280 +/- 90 and -350 +/- 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). In contrast, the restored tidal wetland exhibited lower C burial rates over decadal timescales (70 +/- 19 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) that accounted for similar to 13%-23% of its annual C uptake, suggesting that the remaining fraction is exported via lateral hydrologic flux. From an ecosystem radiative balance perspective, the restored tidal wetland showed a > 10 times higher CO2-sequestration to CH4-emission ratio than the nontidal managed wetlands. Thus overall, tidal wetland restoration resulted in a negative radiative forcing (cooling) through increased soil C accumulation, while nontidal wetland restoration led to an early positive forcing (warming) through increased CH4 emissions potentially lasting between 2.1 +/- 2.0 to 8 +/- 4 decades.

AB  - Coastal wetland plants are adapted to varying degrees of inundation. However, functional relationships between inundation and productivity are poorly characterized for most species. Determining species-specific tolerances to inundation is necessary to evaluate sea-level rise (SLR) effects on future marsh plant community composition, quantify organic matter inputs to marsh accretion, and inform predictive modeling of tidal wetland persistence. In 2 macrotidal estuaries in the northeast Pacific we grew 5 common species in experimental mesocosms across a gradient of tidal elevations to assess effects on growth. We also tested whether species abundance distributions along elevation gradients in adjacent marshes matched productivity profiles in the mesocosms. We found parabolic relationships between inundation and total plant biomass and shoot counts in Spartina foliosa and Bolboschoenus maritimus in California, USA, and in Carex lyngbyei in Oregon, USA, with maximum total plant biomass occurring at 38, 28, and 15% time submerged, respectively. However, biomass of Salicornia pacifica and Juncus balticus declined monotonically with increasing inundation. Inundation effects on the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass varied inconsistently among species. In comparisons of field distributions with mesocosm results, B. maritimus, C. lyngbyei and J. balticus were abundant in marshes at or above elevations corresponding with their maximum productivity; however, S. foliosa and S. pacifica were frequently abundant at lower elevations corresponding with sub-optimal productivity. Our findings show species-level differences in how marsh plant growth may respond to future SLR and highlight the sensitivity of high marsh species such as S. pacifica and J. balticus to increases in flooding.

AB  - With sea level rise accelerating and sediment inputs to the coast declining worldwide, there is concern that tidal wetlands will drown. To better understand this concern, sources of sediment contributing to marsh elevation gain were computed for Plum Island Sound estuary, MA, USA. We quantified input of sediment from rivers and erosion of marsh edges. Maintaining elevation relative to the recent sea level rise rate of 2.8 mm yr(-1) requires input of 32,299 MT yr(-1) of sediment. The input from watersheds is only 3,210 MT yr(-1). Marsh edge erosion, based on a comparison of 2005 and 2011 LiDAR data, provides 10,032 MT yr(-1). This level of erosion is met by <0.1% of total marsh area eroded annually. Mass balance suggests that 19,070 MT yr(-1) should be of tidal flat or oceanic origin. The estuarine distribution of C-14 and C-13 isotopes of suspended particulate organic carbon confirms the resuspension of ancient marsh peat from marsh edge erosion, and the vertical distribution of C-14-humin material in marsh sediment is indicative of the deposition of ancient organic carbon on the marsh platform. High resuspension rates in the estuarine water column are sufficient to meet marsh accretionary needs. Marsh edge erosion provides an important fraction of the material needed for marsh accretion. Because of limited sediment supply and sea level rise, the marsh platform maintains elevation at the expense of total marsh area.
   Plain Language Summary Tidal marshes in the Plum Island Sound estuary have been gaining elevation over the past 100 years at about the same rate as sea level rise (SLR), but there is concern that they will drown and disappear if rates of SLR increase substantially due to CO2 emissions and climate change. What are the sediment sources enabling elevation gain? Rivers were not the primary source, providing less than 10% of elevation gain needs. Marsh edge erosion is much more important-providing over 30% of needs. We estimate that the remainder comes from the ocean or erosion of tidal flats. If the ocean is a major source, these marshes might be able to maintain elevation throughout the 21st century even if SLR greatly accelerates. However, if erosion of tidal flats is the primary source of sediments, the future outlook is less favorable because the more tidal flat erosion increases, the more edge erosion will also increase. The net result will be a loss of marsh area in this system. The dynamics we found for Plum Island Sound are likely to be occurring globally, as declining sediment inputs from rivers, and increasing rates of SLR due to climate change are worldwide phenomenon. Loss of marshes will have a major impact on the resilience of coastal communities landward of the marshes and the productivity of most coastal fisheries.

AB  - We compile a multi-proxy Holocene record from North Raft Lake located in the sub-Arctic Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada. Specifically, we use subfossil chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, non-pollen palynomorphs, sedimentary chlorophyll a, magnetic susceptibility, and organic matter content to characterize terrestrial and lake processes and to track paleoclimate following land emergence from the postglacial Tyrrell Sea. Following recession of the Tyrrell Sea (similar to 6600 cal yr BP), pollen assemblages are indicative of a salt marsh environment with the establishment of an opportunistic chironomid assemblage. By similar to 6200 cal yr BP, isostatic uplift reduced the marine influence and pollen and palynomorph assemblage changes indicate that North Raft Lake became a closed-basin freshwater system. At this time, pollen assemblages signify the establishment of a forested peatland dominated by Picea, and chironomid taxa indicate warming water temperatures. The North Raft Lake pollen/palynomorph record captures a warm and moist mid-Holocene (Holocene Thermal Maximum) period starting similar to 6200 cal yr BP. During this period, an increase in pollen concentration and a shift to higher abundances of Larix indicate watershed-scale succession and enhanced local ecosystem productivity. Shifts in chironomid taxa at similar to 5000 cal yr BP are indicative of abrupt limnological changes suggesting wet conditions that caused an expansion of littoral habitat. The gradual transition into Neoglacial cooling is signaled by an increase in the abundances of cold-stenothermal chironomid taxa and a small decline in pollen-reconstructed temperatures. Marked changes occur in the mid-twentieth century with the appearance of diatoms in notable abundances for the first time in the lake's sedimentary record, the arrival of new chironomid littoral taxa, and unprecedented increases in sedimentary chlorophyll a and organic matter content. Throughout the North Raft Lake Holocene sediment record, the pollen trends suggest slow centennial-scale changes in temperature and precipitation, whereas chironomid assemblages indicate abrupt mid-Holocene and twentieth century limnological changes, stressing that biota in lakes of the Hudson Bay Lowlands may change substantially under future scenarios of global climate warming.

AB  - A slow flow, plug-through reactor was developed for measuring equilibrium and kinetic parameters of biogeochemical reactions on intact sections of sediment cores. The experimental approach was designed to preserve the structural, geochemical and microbiological integrity of the sediment sections and, hence, retrieve reaction parameters that apply to in-situ conditions.
   Inert tracer breakthrough experiments were performed on a variety of unconsolidated surface sediments from lacustrine, estuarine and marine depositional environments. The sediments studied cover wide ranges of composition, porosity (46-83%) and mean grain size (10(-4)-10(-2) cm). Longitudinal dispersion coefficients were determined from the breakthrough curves of Br-. The curves were also used to check for early breakthrough or trailing, that is, features indicative of non-ideal flow conditions. Sediment plugs that exhibited these features were eliminated from further experiments.
   Dimensionless equilibrium adsorption coefficients (K) of NH4+, were calculated from measured retardation times between the breakthrough of NH4+ and Br-. The values of K at 5 degrees C vary between 0.3 and 2.3, with the highest value obtained in a fine-grained marine sediment, the lowest in a coarse-grained lake sediment. The values for the marine and estuarine sediments agree with values reported in the literature. The dependencies of K on ionic strength (range 0.2-0.7 m) and temperature (range 5-25 degrees C) in an estuarine sediment confirm that the main sorption mechanism for NH4+ is ion exchange.
   The reactor was used in recirculation mode to measure steady-state rates of dissimilatory SO42- reduction in a salt-marsh sediment. Recirculation homogenizes solute concentrations within the reactor, hence facilitating the derivation of reaction rate expressions that depend on solution composition. The rate of microbial SO(4)(2-)reduction was found to be nearly independent of the dissolved SO42- concentration in the range of 2.2-1 mM. Fitting of the experimental rates to a Monod relationship resulted in a maximum estimate of the half-saturation concentration, K-s, of 240 mu M. This value is comparable to those reported for a pure culture of SO42--reducing bacteria, but is significantly smaller than the only other K-s value reported in the literature for SO42- utilization in a natural marine sediment.

AB  - Invasive common reed (Phragmites australis) can rapidly form expansive, near-monotypic stands, and thereby lower plant diversity and change marsh habitat structure. Consequently, North American wetland managers often use herbicides, such as glyphosate-based AquaNeat(A (R)) and imazypr-based Habitat(A (R)), to control its establishment and spread. However, herbiciding might indirectly affect benthic community structure by directly altering habitat structure, and habitat alterations may vary with herbicide and concentration. These effects may be particularly pronounced a parts per thousand yen1 year post-herbiciding when dead above-ground biomass collapses and submerges. To evaluate how herbicide-caused alterations in habitat affect key trophic linkages, we compared snail and epiphytic algal assemblages, and habitat conditions, among 20- x 20-m replicated plots of reed treated with either AquaNeat(A (R)) (30 % solution), Habitat(A (R)) (5 % solution), or left herbicide-free (i.e., controls) in an eutrophic Lake Erie coastal marsh 1-y post-herbiciding. Both herbicides equally reduced reed above-ground growth by > 90 % relative to controls. Fossaria spp. and Gyraulus parvus snails were more abundant in herbicide-treated plots than in controls, but Shannon-Wiener diversity was similar (H' a parts per thousand 1.0) across treatments. All snails collected were pulmonates, suggesting habitat drying might be driving assemblage structure. Snails were denser in plots with metaphyton (mostly Spirogyra) than without, and metaphyton was more abundant in herbicide-treated plots with higher incident light levels and warmer water temperatures than in controls. Snail biomass was positively related to amount of benthic macro-organic matter but not epiphytic algal biomass, which was similar among treatments. Diatoms dominated algal communities in all treatments. In June, Navicula spp. was dominant in controls, whereas Nitzschia palea and Aulacoseira italic, and Nitzschia spp., were dominant in AquaNeat(A (R)) and Habitat(A (R)) treatments, respectively. However, algal and diatom assemblages were similar in treatments by early-July when marsh water levels significantly decreased and nitrate levels were < 1 mu g/L. Marsh hydrologic patterns may mediate herbiciding's indirect effects on trophic structure.

AB  - Intertidal sediment physico-chemistry was compared at 2 naturally developing barrier island marshes in Virginia, USA. One site was located on the intertidal portion of a sand flat, deposited during a coastal storm in October 1991. The other site was an undisturbed, fringing marsh aged at 14 to 16 yr, Three sampling stations were established at equivalent elevations at both sites. At the marsh site, these sampling stations represented tall and short forms of Spartina alterniflora (low and intermediate elevation stations) and a high marsh zone of mostly Spartina patens (high elevation station). At both sites, sediment across the intertidal zone was characterized by <1.5% organic matter and >90% sand. Relative to the marsh site, the sand flat site had significantly higher pore water salinity and redox potential at the upper elevation stations, higher pH at all stations, and lower hydrogen sulfide at the 2 lower elevation stations. Organically bound nutrients generally were higher in the root zone of the marsh site, but inorganic nutrients were an order of magnitude higher at the low elevation station of the sand flat compared to all stations at the marsh site. The higher concentration of nutrients at the sand flat site may arise from a nutrient-sich mud flat buried during the storm event. This high concentration of nutrients could serve as an external nutrient source to the root zone of the developing marsh and may also lead to a net export of inorganic nutrients to the flooding tidal water. A predictable zonation of intertidal vegetation on the sand flat should exist given the present patterns in sediment physico-chemistry. Based on nutrient standing stocks, the most favorable growing conditions for S. alterniflora exist at the low elevation station of the sand flat, where the tall form of this species is expected to dominate. The short form of S, alterniflora is expected to colonize the intermediate elevation station. A mixed community of species (S, patens, Distichlis spicata) probably will develop at the high elevation station, where the sediment is most oxidized. Vegetation zonation at the marsh site was not readily explained by patterns in sediment physico-chemistry measured in this study. Current research by the authors indicates that nutrient dynamics, controlled by subsurface hydrology, dictates nutrient supply at the marsh site and leads to a higher exposure to nutrients in the root zone of the tall form of S. alterniflora. The present study represents one of few involving measurements of sediment physico-chemistry in naturally developing marshes during the initial stages of development.

AB  - The presence and digestive capabilities of bacteria associated with the digestive systems and habitats of two saltmarsh-burrowing detritivore thalassinid prawns (Upogebia africana and Callianassa kraussi) was examined. U. africana is a filter-feeding prawn inhabiting muddy deposits, whereas C. kraussi, a deposit feeder, inhabits coarser more sandy deposits. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the gut lining and associated microflora and the nature of the ingested food of both prawns. The gut contents of both prawns included plant fragments, fragmented diatoms, partially degraded protozoa, and bacteria attached to organic matter. In both U. africana and C. kraussi the midgut walls and gut contents were extensively coated by filamentous bacteria which were absent in the hindgut. The hindgut epithelium of U. africana was coated by mats of rodshaped bacteria, not reported in marine invertebrates previously. The digestive glands of both species contained bacteria in the lumen. Isolation of gut and habitat bacteria suggests that both U. africana and C. kraussi maintain a gut microflora distinct from the habitat microflora. Bacteria isolated from the guts of both species of prawn differed from those isolated from their respective habitats with regards to both the genera isolated and their digestive capabilities. The dominant genera isolated from the guts of both U. africana and C. kraussi were Vibrio and Pseudomonas, with an unidentified fermenter and Pseudomonas, respectively dominating in the digestive glands. Bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter dominated the isolates from the habitats of both species of prawn. Resident gut bacteria isolated from the guts of both species of prawn exhibited lipase, protease, chitinase, and lysozyme, but not cellulase activity, and may contribute to nitrogen aquisition by the prawns. Isolates from the prawn's habitat exhibited alginase, gelatinase, and lipase activity, a few (3%) from U. africana habitat having cellulases. In this study a distinction between resident gut bacteria and transient gut bacteria was made. Results suggest that some habitat bacteria remain viable in the guts of U. africana, but not in C. kraussi.

AB  - Living shoreline marshes are coastal wetlands constructed as alternatives to "hardened shorelines" (e.g., bulkheads, riprap) to mitigate erosion and to allow for landward migration of intertidal habitat as sea level rises. Living shorelines are designed to mimic natural fringing marshes and over time should be sinks for carbon and other nutrients. We collected soil cores and aboveground plant material from 13 pairs of natural fringing marshes and living shoreline marshes of different ages and degree of isolation from more extensive marsh shorescapes to compare nutrient pools and accrual. Although the nutrient content of plants was similar within and between marsh types, soil nutrients were variable from both living shorelines aged 2-16 years and long-established natural marshes. Most-but not all-living shoreline marshes had lower soil organic content, higher bulk density, and lower soil % carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus than their natural marsh pair. Variation in soil nutrients from living shorelines was not strongly correlated with either marsh age or degree of isolation in the estuarine shorescape. Assuming constant accrual within individual marshes, we estimated soil nutrient levels in living shorelines would approach those observed in their paired, natural fringing marshes over timescales from less than 10 years to many decades. Living shoreline marshes are on trajectories to match natural marsh function with respect to carbon and nutrient storage in estuarine systems.

AB  - With the increasing pace of global warming, studies of the carbon cycle and carbon sink capacity of estuarine wetlands have received increasing attention. Estuarine wetlands are often located in economically developed and densely populated areas, and their reclamation has become an important way to acquire land resources. To explore the effect of reclamation on the carbon sink function of estuarine wetlands, the Chongming Dongtan reclaimed wetland and jiuduansha natural wetland, which are located in the Yangtze River estuary, were selected to investigate their variabilities in carbon fluxes and the main influencing factors using the open path eddy co-variance flux monitoring system. The CO2 uptake capacity of the Dongtan reclaimed wetland was significantly weaker than that of the Jiuduansha natural wetland (P < 0.05). The difference in carbon fluxes between the two wetlands was mainly influenced by plant growth and carbon fixation, which accounted for 70.7% of the variation, with soil respiration being the second most important factor. The soil water content and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the redaimed wetland significantly decreased due to the barrier to water flow presented by a dam (P < 0.01). Nitrogen limitation was the main reason for the poor plant growth in the reclaimed wetland. Although nitrogen inputs in the natural wetland promoted soil respiration (40.6%), they were overshadowed by the inhibitory effect of soil moisture and salinity (55.8%). It was therefore possible to improve the carbon sink function of reclaimed wetlands if plant growth and carbon fixation efficiency could be enhanced without promoting soil respiration.

AB  - Severely degraded wetlands due to the lack of freshwater were restored by reintroducing freshwater through the placement of artificial dikes and channels in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) of China. Many studies have evaluated the performances of this restoration projects in aspects of vegetation, soils, hydrology, wildlife, etc. In contrast, limited information was available on the effects of restoration projects on the soil microbial biomass and community composition. To better understand the wetland restoration, differences in soil microbial biomass and community composition between restored tidal wetlands and unrestored wetlands under the disturbance of petroleum exploitation activities or tidal intrusion were assessed. Surface soils (0-10 cm) under three different plant covers (Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa and bare land) were collected from each three wetland zones. Chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis were used to characterize soil microbial biomass and community composition. Our results showed significantly elevated microbial biomass in soils of the restoration zone, as indicated by both microbial biomass carbon and total PLFAs. Soil microbial community composition in the restoration zone also differed significantly from those in the petroleum exploitation zone and tidal zone. The freshwater input of restoration projects induced a soil microbial community shift to the increased relative abundance of fungi and decreased relative abundance of Desulfovibrio bacteria. The significantly promoted fungi in soils under P. australis of the restoration zone reflected the necessity of decomposers of the increased surface plant residues after restoration, which in turn contributed to the organic residues accumulation in soils and large aggregates formation by fungal hyphae. Meanwhile the modified soil carbon pool and aggregate structure following restoration of degraded wetland may favor the colonization of soil organisms. These results indicated that freshwater input had strongly altered soil microbial communities in the restored wetland, which may be of great significance in understanding the soil microbial responses to the restoration projects and the underlying mechanisms of wetland restoration.

AB  - The objective of this study is to elucidate the burrow structure and to clarify the role of burrows in material cycle in the tidal flat. In our work, we focused on the dominant species in muddy tidal flat, crab Macrophthalmus japonicus.
   Burrow structure of Macrophthalmus japonicus was investigated on a Katsuura river tidal flat in Tokushima prefecture,Japan, using in situ resin casting. Sampling was conducted in August 2006, and a total of 48 burrow casts were obtained. Burrows consisted mainly of J-shaped structures (98%) while the rest belonged to U-shaped structures (2%). The maximum measured burrow volume was 120 cm(3) and wall surface area was 224 cm(2), while maximum burrow length and depth were 23.2 cm and 16.5 cm, respectively. Burrow volume and surface area were strongly correlated with carapace width of M. japonicus. Investigation of the individual number of M. japonicus in 13 quadrats (50 x 50 x 20 cm) was conducted using 2 mm sieve. The number of M. japonicus was 15-31 ind./m(2). Using cohort analysis we estimated that surface area of burrows was 0.07-0.15 m(2)/m(2).
   CO2 emission rate was measured at the surface sediment during the period from June to December 2008. Results varied from 13.8 +/- 2.2 to 49.4 +/- 3.2 mg CO2/m(2)/h, and organic carbon decomposition was 3.8 +/- 0.6-13.5 +/- 0.9 mg C/m(2)/h. This leads the increase of organic carbon decomposition by 1.1 times, because of the expansion of the tidal flat surface area by burrowing activity. Organic carbon decomposition in burrow walls therefore contributed to organic matter decomposition in the tidal flat.

AB  - We assessed the utility of delta C-13 and bulk geochemistry (total organic content and C:N) to reconstruct relative sea-level changes on the Cascadia subduction zone through comparison with an established sea-level indicator (benthic foraminifera). Four modern transects collected from three tidal environments at Siletz Bay, Oregon, USA, produced three elevation-dependent groups in both the foraminiferal and delta C-13/bulk geochemistry datasets. Foraminiferal samples from the tidal flat and low marsh are identified by Miliammina fusca abundances of >45%, middle and high marsh by M. fusca abundances of <45% and the highest marsh by Trochamminita irregularis abundances >25%. The delta C-13 values from the groups defined with delta C-13/bulk geochemistry analyses decrease with an increasing elevation; -24.1 +/- 1.7 parts per thousand in the tidal flat and low marsh; -27.3 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand in the middle and high marsh; and -29.6 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand in the highest marsh samples. We applied the modern foraminiferal and delta C-13 distributions to a core that contained a stratigraphic contact marking the great Cascadia earthquake of AD 1700. Both techniques gave similar values for coseismic subsidence across the contact (0.88 +/- 0.39 m and 0.71 +/- 0.56 m) suggesting that delta C-13 has potential for identifying amounts of relative sea-level change due to tectonics.

AB  - Seasonal variation of inorganic nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization of soils were investigated by using in situ incubation method in three wetlands with different flooding periods (i.e., short-term, seasonal, and tidal flooding) in the Yellow River Delta, China. Results showed that N mineralization in short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands could be classified into one group. Inorganic nitrogen showed higher concentrations during the period from spring to early summer, and then it decreased after June for short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands. Net N mineralization rate appeared negative value but sequently increased and reached the positive maximum value during the period from late autumn to early winter. However, in tidal flooding wetland, both inorganic N and N mineralization rate kept relative constant. The effects of inundation due to water and sediment regulation were different on three wetlands. Inorganic N contents in soil decreased in short-term and seasonal flooding wetlands whereas increased in tidal flooding wetland. The changing tendency of net N mineralization rate was opposite to that of ammonium rate.

AB  - Metal accumulation by Juncus maritimus and the effect this plant might have on the physicochemical composition of sediments, from Douro river estuary (NW Portugal), were investigated through one year of plant's life. The contents of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes) and different tissues of J. maritimus. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied, one a sandy sediment with relatively low organic matter content, the other a muddy site. The role of the plant seemed to be markedly dependent on the sediment composition. At the sandy site, significant variations throughout the year (a decrease from winter to summer and an increase in autumn) either in rhizosediment and sediment or in J. maritimus roots were only observed in Cd and Cu levels. These variations were the same in both compartments, probably caused by tidal water movements and the activity of the plant. At the muddy site, variations throughout the year were observed for all studied elements but Pb. Changes in the Cd and Zn contents of roots were opposite to those in the rhizosediment (uptake of Cd and Zn by J maritimus roots in summer may have caused a decrease in rhizosediment levels). Fe and Mn showed similar patterns of variation in both roots and rhizosediment (contents significantly increasing in summer). Higher contents of Fe and Mn in roots in summer could be related to changes in mass, higher availability of the elements, or accumulation at the surface of the root in (hydr)oxides forms. For the remaining elements no significant correlations between rhizosediment and roots variations were observed, indicating that their uptake and release by roots were not based on single exchanges with the sediment. J. maritimus showed capacity to accumulate Cu, Zn and particularly Cd, thus appearing to be useful for the phytostabilization of these metals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estuaries worldwide act as "filters" of landderived nitrogen (N) loads, yet differences in coastal environmental settings can affect the N filter function. We investigated microbial N retention (nitrification, ammonium assimilation) and N removal (denitrification, anammox) processes in the aphotic benthic system (bottom boundary layer (BBL) and sediment) of two Baltic Sea estuaries differing in riverine N loads, trophic state, geomorphology, and sediment type. In the BBL, rates of nitrification (5-227 nmol N L-1 d(-1)) and ammonium assimilation (9-704 nmol N L-1 d(-1)) were not enhanced in the eutrophied Vistula Estuary compared to the oligotrophic Ore Estuary. No anammox was detected in the sediment of either estuary, while denitrification rates were twice as high in the eutrophied (352 +/- 123 mu mol N m(-2) d(-1)) as in the oligotrophic estuary. Particulate organic matter (POM) was mainly of phytoplankton origin in the benthic systems of both estuaries. It seemed to control heterotrophic denitrification and ammonium assimilation as well as autotrophic nitrification by functioning as a substrate source of N and organic carbon. Our data suggest that in stratified estuaries, POM is an essential link between riverine N loads and benthic N turnover and may furthermore function as a temporary N reservoir. During long particle residence times or alongshore transport pathways, increased time is available for the recycling of N until its eventual removal, allowing effective coastal filtering even at low process rates. Understanding the key controls and microbial N processes in the coastal N filter therefore requires to also consider the effects of geomorphological and hydrological features.

AB  - Human activities have led to 1-2% of coastal wetlands lost per year globally, with subsequent losses in ecosystem services such as nutrient filtering and carbon sequestration. Wetland construction is used to mitigate losses of marsh cover and services resulting from human impacts in coastal areas. Though marsh structure can recover relatively quickly (i.e., <10 years) after construction, there are often long-term lags in the recovery of ecosystem functions in constructed marshes. We conducted a year-long study comparing seasonal plant productivity, ecosystem respiration (ERCO2), denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) between two 33-year-old constructed marshes (CON-1, CON-2) and a nearby natural reference marsh (NAT). We found that CON-1 and CON-2 were structurally similar to NAT (i.e., plant aboveground and belowground biomass did not differ). Likewise, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), ERCO2, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were similar across all marshes. Further, DNRA and denitrification were similar across marshes, with the exception of greater denitrification rates at CON-2 than at the other two sites. While pore-water ammonium concentrations were similar across all marshes, organic matter (OM) content, pore-water phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were greater in NAT than CON-1 and CON-2. Collectively, this work suggests that current marsh construction practices could be a suitable tool for recovering plant structure and some ecosystem functions. However, the lag in recovery of pore-water nutrient stocks and OM content also suggests that some biogeochemical functions may take longer than a few decades to fully recover in constructed marshes.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions play a crucial role in the carbon cycle of alpine wetland ecosystems and regional climate regulation. In the last decades, alpine marshes at Tibetan Plateau have undergone increased degradation. The effects of marsh degradation on soil labile and recalcitrant organic carbon fractions and on SOC stability remain unclear. In this study, we investigated changes in SOC fractions with different biochemical recalcitrance and stability in the marsh ecosystems with various levels of degradation in the Zoige Wetland, Eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil samples of relatively pristine marsh (RPM), lightly degraded marsh (LDM), moderately degraded marsh (MDM), heavily degraded marsh (HDM) and severely degraded marsh (SDM) were collected and analysed using the acid hydrolysis method. Compared with RPM, the concentrations of SOC labile fraction I (non-cellulosic polysaccharides), SOC labile fraction II (cellulose) and recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) in degraded marshes decreased significantly: 29-97, 38-95 and 32-99%, respectively, except for the LDM. The SOC recalcitrance index (RIc) in the HDM and SDM was significantly lower than that in RPM by 11-35 and 15-47%, respectively; compared with RPM, the stability of organic carbon was significantly lower in the HDM and SDM. Additionally, the marsh degradation increased vertical variation in the concentrations of SOC fractions. The degradation of alpine marshes decreases the capacity for carbon (C) sequestration via decreasing the resistance of SOC to biodegradation, indicating that the alpine marsh degradation may weaken the carbon sink capacity of the Zoige Plateau, thus aggravating the global greenhouse effect.

AB  - The global uptake of CO2 in photosynthesis is about 120 gigatons (Gt) of carbon per year. Virtually all passes through one enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco). which initiates both the photosynthetic carbon reduction, and photorespiratory carbon oxidation, cycles. Both CO2 and O2 are substrates; CO2 also activates the enzyme. In C3 plants, rubisco has a low catalytic activity, operates below its K(m) (CO2), and is inhibited by O2. Consequently, increases in the CO2/O2 ratio stimulate C3 photosynthesis and inhibit photorespiration. CO2 enrichment usually enhances the productivity of C3 plants, but the effect is marginal in C4 species. It also causes acclimation in various ways: anatomically. morphologically, physiologically or biochemically. So, CO2 exerts secondary effects in growth regulation, probably at the molecular level, that are not predictable from its primary biochemical role in carboxylation. After an initial increase with CO2 enrichment, net photosynthesis often declines. This is a common acclimation phenomenon, less so in field studies, that is ultimately mediated by a decline in rubisco activity, though the RuBP/P(i)-regeneration capacities of the plant may play a role. The decline is due to decreased rubisco protein, activation state, and/or specific activity, and it maintains the rubisco fixation and RuBP/P(i)-regeneration capacities in balance. Carbohydrate accumulation is sometimes associated with reduced net photosynthesis, possibly causing feedback inhibition of the RuBP/P(i)-regeneration capacities, or chloroplast disruption. As exemplified by field-grown soybeans and salt marsh species, a reduction in net photosynthesis and rubisco activity is not inevitable under CO2 enrichment. Strong sinks or rapid translocation may avoid such acclimation responses. Over geological time, aquatic autotrophs and terrestrial C4 and CAM plants have genetically adapted to a decline in the external CO2/O2 ratio, by the development of mechanisms to concentrate CO2 internally; thus circumventing O2 inhibition of rubisco. Here rubisco affinity for CO2 is less, but its catalytic activity is greater, a situation compatible with a high-CO2 internal environment. In aquatic autotrophs, the CO2 concentrating mechanisms acclimate to the external CO2, being suppressed at high-CO2. It is unclear, whether a doubling in atmospheric CO2 will be sufficient to cause a de-adaptive trend in the rubisco kinetics of future C3 plants, producing higher catalytic activities.

AB  - Many marine ecosystems have the capacity for long-term storage of organic carbon (C) in what are termed blue carbon systems. While blue carbon systems (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) are efficient at long-term sequestration of organic carbon (C), much of their sequestered C may originate from other (allochthonous) habitats. Macroalgae, due to their high rates of production, fragmentation, and ability to be transported, would also appear to be able to make a significant contribution as C donors to blue C habitats. In order to assess the stability of macroalgal tissues and their likely contribution to long-term pools of C, we applied thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to 14 taxa of marine macroalgae and coastal vascular plants. We assessed the structural complexity of multiple lineages of plant and tissue types with differing cell wall structures and found that decomposition dynamics varied significantly according to differences in cell wall structure and composition among taxonomic groups and tissue function (photosynthetic vs. attachment). Vascular plant tissues generally exhibited greater stability with a greater proportion of mass loss at temperatures >300 degrees C (peak mass loss similar to 320 degrees C) than macroalgae (peak mass loss between 175-300 degrees C), consistent with the lignocellulose matrix of vascular plants. Greater variation in thermogravimetric signatures within and among macroalgal taxa, relative to vascular plants, was also consistent with the diversity of cell wall structure and composition among groups. Significant degradation above 600 degrees C for some macroalgae, as well as some belowground seagrass tissues, is likely due to the presence of taxon-specific compounds. The results of this study highlight the importance of the lignocellulose matrix to the stability of vascular plant sources and the potentially significant role of refractory, taxon-specific compounds (carbonates, long-chain lipids, alginates, xylans, and sulfated polysaccharides) from macroalgae and seagrasses for their long-term sedimentary C storage. This study shows that marine macroalgae do contain refractory compounds and thus may be more valuable to long-term carbon sequestration than we previously have considered.

AB  - During the past 50 years, the amount of agricultural fertilizer used in Northern China increased from about 7.5 kg ha(-1) in the 1950s to approximately 348 kg ha(-1) in the 1990s. Given that little is known about the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil labile carbon fraction in Northern China, this paper evaluated such effects in terms of microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon in the Sanjiang Plain located in Northeast China. Soils with different cultivation time and undisturbed marsh with Deyeuxia angustifolia were selected to study the effects of nitrogen fertilization on the soil labile organic fractions microbial C (biomass C, microbial quotient, and basal respiration) and to estimate the contributions of nitrogen input on the dynamics of soil labile carbon. Continuous nitrogen application decreased total organic and dissolved organic carbon concentrations significantly, leading to the lack of carbon source for microbes. Therefore, continuous nitrogen fertilizer application induced negative effects on measured soil microbiological properties. However, a moderate nitrogen application rate (60 kg N ha(-1)) stimulated soil microbial activity in the short term (about 2 months), whereas a high nitrogen application rate (150 kg N ha(-1)) inhibited measured soil microbiological properties in the same period.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora has rapidly expanded in coastal wetlands of China, and this would affect soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and stability. In the present work, the impacts of S. alterniflora colonization on SOC pool and stability was deciphered to better understand how alien species altered the carbon cycle in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). SOC contents were in the range of 1.29 g/kg-7.02 g/kg, of which wetlands covered by S. alterniflora increased with colonization time and exceed those in wetlands covered by native species after 7 years. Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis showed that aromatic moieties were predominant components of SOC, and there were remarkable increase trends of phenol and lignin compounds and decrease trend of aromatic moieties with S. alterniflora invasion time. SA had the highest microorganism biomass reflected by phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) across different wetlands. Salinity had the largest negative effects while nutrients had the largest positive effects on the SOC pool. The proportion of decomposition-resistant compounds (including aromatics, lignin, and phenol) to total SOC was decreasing while the SOC pool was increasing with S. alterniflora invasion time. This study demonstrated that S. alterniflora invasion could promote the SOC pool but weaken its stability in the wetlands of the YRD. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oritani Marsh in the Hackensack Meadowlands of urbanized northeastern New Jersey USA was assessed in 2000 for vegetation, soil/sediment chemistry, abundance/diversity of benthic invertebrates, and bird and mammal usage. Vegetatively, both marsh and uplands are dominated by tall, dense Phragrnites australis. Small patches (less than 2 hectares total) dominated by Spartina spp. were found at the lowest elevations. Soil/sediment cores were sliced into 5 intervals and analyzed for metals, pesticides and volatile/semivolatile organic compounds. Thirteen locations had at least one chemical above Long et al.'s [Environmental Management, 19, 1995, 81-97] "Effects Range-Median" (ERM). Seven metals and nine organics exceeded ERM in at least one sample, with mercury showing the most exceedances. The Surface 15 cm interval was generally more contaminated with metals than the 15 to 30cm interval; the reverse was true for semivolatile organic compounds. Twenty taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates were collected, with each location producing froth 1 to 9 taxa. Abundance ranged froth 11 to 3,889 individuals/m(2). Number of taxa was moderately (r(2) between 0.40 and 0.70) negatively correlated with zinc, beryllium, nickel and arsenic concentrations; no other chemical's r(2) was above 0.25. Diversity was moderately negatively correlated with arsenic and beryllium. These correlations were unexpected: zinc, beryllium, nickel and arsenic were not the chemicals found at the highest concentrations relative to benchmarks. Number of taxi, abundance and diversity were moderately (negatively) correlated with elevation; organic carbon was moderately (positively) correlated with abundance. All other correlations were weak (r(2) < 0.35). Live traps captured only one mammal species, the meadow jumping mouse. Bird observations revealed 39 species, dominated by a few common species.

AB  - Sea level rise is expected to push saline waters into previously fresher regions of estuaries, and higher salinities may expose oligohaline marshes to invertebrate herbivores typically constrained by salinity. The smooth cordgrass,Spartina alterniflora(syn.Sporobolus alterniflorus), can defend itself against herbivores in polyhaline marshes, however it is not known ifS. alterniflora's defense varies along the mesohaline to oligohaline marsh gradient in estuaries. I found thatS. alterniflorafrom a mesohaline marsh is better defended than plants from an oligohaline marsh, supporting the optimal defense theory. Higher salinity treatments lowered carbon content, C:N, and new stem biomass production, traits associated with a tolerance strategy, suggesting that salinity may mediate the defense response ofS. alterniflora. Further, simulated herbivory increased the nitrogen content and decreased C:N ofS. alterniflora. This indicates that grazing may increaseS. alterniflorasusceptibility to future herbivory via improved forage quality. Simulated herbivory also decreased both belowground and new stem biomass production, highlighting a potential pathway in which herbivory can indirectly facilitate marsh loss, asS. alterniflorabiomass is critical for vertical accretion and marsh stability under future sea level rise scenarios.

AB  - We reconstructed the paleoenvironmental conditions of the Mazarron Basin during MIS 7 and MIS 1 based on their alkane and fatty acid contents, their mineralogy and the fossil content of an aminoacid-dated sediment sequence. The n-alkane and fatty acid indices proved to be excellent paleoenvironmental proxies for studying the paleo-hydrogeological and paleoclimatological evolution of this marshland. Three geochemical units (GUs) were identified from the abundance of the C-25 n-alkane and the ACL, TAR(HC) and P-aq values, confirming the importance of phases with terrestrial plant input or aquatic macrophyte predominance. These GUs were used to define three paleoenvironmental episodes (PEs) during MIS 7. In PE7.1, the contribution of algal and aquatic macrophytes predominated in a temporarily flooded saline muddy plain. In PE7.2, the major contribution was from aquatic macrophytes (flooded marsh), although it was marked by episodes of emersion with greater terrestrial contribution. At the top of the MIS 7 record (PE7.3), there was a significant reduction in the water depth, with the main input deriving from terrestrial plants in a muddy alluvial plain. Six PEs were established during MIS 1 (Holocene), of which three predominately received organic matter derived from aquatic macrophytes, while the major contribution in the other three came from terrestrial plants. The two sets of PEs were linked to episodes of increased and decreased water level, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with the characteristics of the sediment facies, with PE1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 corresponding to a marsh with deeper water and a greater input of detrital materials, and PE1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 to a shallow environment with carbonates and gypsum deposits. Direct marine influence was limited, so the oscillations in the water level in the marsh were likely to be more related to climatic changes (drier/wetter phases) and recent tectonics than to large changes in sea level. Emersion led to degradation of the organic matter and enrichment in short-chain and branched saturated fatty acids. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Western Australia has a rich diversity of seagrasses, many of which are meadow-forming species with a high diversity of associated epiphytes. Potential food sources and dominant invertebrates and fishes were collected in a non-quantitative sampling programme designed to examine the variability in naturally occurring isotopes (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) within an Amphibolis griffithii dominated seagrass bed in Western Australia. The aims of this study were to determine the isotopic composition of the organisms, and to determine the sources of carbon available to consumers using the variations in the ratio of N-15/N-14 and C-13/C-12 among organisms in the seagrass assemblage. Autotrophs showed a wide distribution of delta C-13 values, with seagrass material significantly enriched in C-13 relative to macroalgal sources by > 10 parts per thousand. This variation allowed us to successfully identify macroalgae as the main contributor of carbon to the trophic structure. delta N-15 ratios did not vary to the degree that would make it useful as tracer, but it was applied to estimating the total number of trophic transfers of nitrogen. Analysis of delta N-15 values suggested that four trophic positions were present, with fishes (Acanthallitcres vittiger, Scobonichthys granulatus and Siphonognathus radiatus, Pelsartia humeralis, Pelates sexlineatus, Leviprora inops, Odax acroptilus and Notolabrus parilus) occupying the top two levels. delta C-13 of seston (20-200 mu m) and sedimentary organic matter indicate that seagrass material is the main contributor to these two carbon pools, and that very little of it is incorporated into the trophic structure.

AB  - Purpose We investigated S. alterniflora saltmarshes in 10 regions to distinguish the major sources of soil organic carbon (SOC) and provide data for SOC content in Chinese coastal wetlands under exotic invasion. Methods We collected soil and plant samples. We analyzed the soil properties for SOC content, recalcitrant organic carbon (RC), labile organic carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total salinity and water content, as well as stable isotopic carbon composition (delta C-13) in the SOC and RC. SOC and RC were determined using a Shimadzu TOC analyzer. We used delta C-13 values and C/N ratios of the SOC to identify carbon source inputs. The delta C-13 of the SOC and RC was measured using a Sercon Integra CN isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Results The results showed that the S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC pool properties differed significantly between study areas, dependent upon local circumstances and carbon exchanges. The delta C-13 values of SOC in surface sediments from Tianjin to Guangxi were from -25.16 to -20.64 parts per thousand, RC from -27.82 to -23.1 parts per thousand, and C/N ratios between 11.36 and 19.00. These samples had SOC values of 14.77-23.95 g kg(-1), RC values of 11.98-21.44 g kg(-1), and LC values of 0.44-4.08 g kg(-1). The SOC and RC of surface sediments were positively correlated with TN and TP. Conclusions S. alterniflora saltmarsh SOC is derived from multiple carbon inputs including from marine and land sources and its formation is driven by complicated factors. TN and TP inputs increase SOC in coastal wetlands. Generally, terrigenous carbon inputs dominate the SOC composition in Chinese coastal wetlands, although marine-derived organic carbon (OC) inputs to sediment increase from northern to southern areas.

AB  - Armoring shorelines to prevent erosion is a long-standing global practice that has well-documented adverse effects on coastal habitats and organisms. A relatively new form of shoreline protection, referred to as hybrid stabilization, incorporates created marsh in combination with a stabilizing structure such as a low-profile stone sill and is being implemented in many US coastal states as a means to not only control erosion but also to restore coastal habitat. However, there has been limited scientific investigation of ecological benefits and impacts associated with implementation of hybrid stabilization. We evaluated relative habitat capacity of marsh-sills by comparing plant, sediment, and benthic macroinvertebrate attributes in intertidal and subtidal zones of existing marsh-sills, natural marshes, tidal flats, and riprap revetment within two subestuaries of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Low and high marsh plant characteristics (stem count and height) of marsh-sills were similar to or greater than natural marshes. However, sediment was coarser, total organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were lower, and benthic macrofaunal community structure differed in marsh-sills compared to natural marshes. Marsh-sills supported lower deposit-feeding infaunal biomass than marshes in the intertidal. Epifaunal suspension-feeders were most prevalent at sites with artificial structure (riprap and marsh-sill), but highly variable among subestuaries. Infaunal abundance, biomass, diversity, and proportion of suspension/interface and deposit feeding animals were greater in shallow subtidal than in intertidal environments. Conversion of existing habitat to marsh-sills may cause localized loss of benthic productivity and sediment bioturbation and nutrient-cycling functions, with the opportunity to enhance filtration capacity by epifaunal recruitment to structures. When creating marshes that require structural support, there should be a balance of minimizing loss of existing habitats while encouraging use of suitable structural habitat for suspension-feeders. If properly implemented, the addition of structural habitat could subsidize secondary productivity particularly in areas where loss of complex biogenic habitat (e.g., oyster reefs) has occurred.

AB  - To gain a more mechanistic understanding of how soil organic matter (OM) characteristics can affect carbon mineralization in tidal freshwater wetlands, we conducted a long-term in situ field manipulation of OM type and monitored associated changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production. In addition, we characterized microbial community structure and quantified the activity of several extracellular enzymes (EEA) involved in the acquisition of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Treatments included a plant litter addition, prepared using naturally-senescing vegetation from the site, and a compost amendment, designed to increase the concentration of aged, partially humified, OM. Both types of OM-amended soils had CO2 production rates 40-50 % higher than unamended control soils, suggesting that the added OM had inherently higher quality and/or availability than the native soil OM. Rates of CO2 production were not correlated with microbial community structure or EEA except a modest relationship with cellulose breakdown via the K-m of beta-1,4-glucosidase. We interpret this lack of correlation to be a consequence of high functional redundancy of microorganisms that are capable of producing CO2. Rates of CH4 production were also influenced by OM quality, increasing by an order of magnitude with plant litter additions relative to compost-amended and control soils. Unlike CO2, rates of CH4 production were significantly correlated with the microbial community structure and with enzyme kinetic parameters (V-max and K-m) for both carbon (beta-1,4-glucosidase, 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase, and beta-d-xylosidase) and nitrogen acquisition (leucyl aminopeptidase). The monophyletic nature of methanogenic archaea, combined with their reliance on a small select group of organic substrates produced via enzyme-mediated hydrolysis and subsequent bacterial fermentation, provides a basis for the strong links between microbial community structure, EEA, and CH4 production. Our results suggest that incorporating microbial community structure and EEA into conceptual models of wetland OM decomposition may enhance our mechanistic understanding of, and predictive capacity for, biogeochemical process rates.

AB  - Contents of soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface soils and subsurface soils were measured in five types of floodplains classified with different flood frequencies in river marginal wetlands of Erbaifangzi, China, in 1999. Contour maps and profile maps were constructed to describe the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in order to identify the influences of flood frequency on them. Results showed that spatial distributions of both SOM and TN were very similar in soil profiles (0-120 cm) of the five areas, decreasing gradually with depth except an accumulation peak in the flooded floodplain (B area). Also, the accumulation peak in the soil profile of B area was relevant to water table, nitrogen leaching, denitrification and mineralization. However, their horizontal distributions in surface soils (0-10 cm) were different in the five areas. Although the flood could bring the deposit of nutrients and sands, the highest content of SOM or TN did not appear in B area but in the floodplain with certain flood frequency. For example, SOM content (6.76%) in 5-year floodplain wetland was highest, and the highest content of TN (3666.4 mg/kg) appeared in 1-year floodplain wetland. However, SOM and TN contents in soils of B area were 4.08% and 2605.4 mg/kg, respectively. Soil clay content, wetland plant (Phragmites australis) litter inputs, soil moisture and water table greatly affected the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in floodplain wetlands. The ratios of carbon to nitrogen of wetland soils in this region were relatively lower than those in paddy soils. SOM and TN contents were significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) contents in floodplain wetlands except the 100-year floodplain wetland, but they were significantly influenced by soil pH values only in B area. Denitrification and ammonia volatilization were the main mechanisms resulting in nitrogen loss of surface soils in B area. Flood frequency significantly influenced the ecological functions such as nutrient retention and water quality maintenance of floodplains. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated heavy metals (Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg) concentrations in surface sediment of Subei Shoal, China, to illustrate their spatial distribution characteristics, sources and potential ecological risk of pollution. Contents of total organic carbon (TOC), clay, silt and sand were 1.7 +/- 0.8%, 33 +/- 3.2%, 13.6 +/- 14.2% and 83.1 +/- 17.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of TOC, clay and silt were similar; however, distribution of Hg was inverse. Concentrations of Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Cd and Hg were 47.88 +/- 8.93, 38.18 +/- 8.86, 19.22 +/- 5.14, 11.32 +/- 5.07, 6.97 +/- 2.45, 0.13 +/- 0.72, 0.56 +/- 0.77 and 0.06 +/- 0.02 mg kg(-1) sediment, respectively. Principal component analysis suggested that Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni were mainly derived from natural sources, whereas Pb, Cd, As and Hg from industrial and agricultural sources. Results of geo-accumulation index, potential ecological risk index (RI), pollution load index (PLI), toxic risk index (TRI) and contamination severity index (CSI) demonstrated that pollution levels of Cd and Hg were moderate, which should attract more attention as main pollution factors. The pollution was mainly distributed in the central and northern parts, and the southern part had a good ecological environment. Moreover, the contaminated stations accounted respective for 33.4%, 25.9%, 333% and 70.4% of RI, PLI, TRI and CSI, of which 70.4% of the contamination severity index stations contained 66.7% of much lower severity stations. These findings could contribute to more effective exploitation of tidal flat resources, and the prevention and treatment of tidal marsh environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) of and macrofaunal community structure in sediments of five southern California Spartina foliosa marshes (San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay, Bolsa Chica Lagoon, and Anaheim Bay) were examined during October 1994. Macrofaunal densities in Pacific S. foliosa marshes (avg. 122,268 indiv. m(-2) > 300 mu m) were 3 to 10 times higher than observed in Atlantic S. alterniflora and S. anglica marshes. The macrofauna of S. foliosa marshes was composed mainly of enchytraeid, naidid, and tubificid oligochaetes (66%), with the enchytraeids dominant at all sites except Bolsa Chica Lagoon. Polychaetes, insects, and peracarid crustaceans accounted for most of the remaining fauna. Multivariate analyses indicated greatest faunal similarity between the two southernmost marshes (Mission Bay and San Diego Bay), and between Anaheim and Newport Bay marshes, with Bolsa Chica Lagoon exhibiting a distinct assemblage. There were strong positive associations of faunal abundance and composition with percent organic matter and percent open area, and negative associations with percent sand and dry weight of algae. For the vegetated marsh in Mission Bay, faunal comparisons were made with an adjacent mudflat and with a S. alterniflora marsh in North Carolina, USA. The unvegetated mudflat exhibited similar macrofaunal densities but higher species richness than the adjacent Spartina marsh. The macrofaunal assemblage of the Mission Bay S. foliosa marsh differed from that of the Atlantic S. alterniflora marsh and the Pacific mudflat in having a greater proportion of oligochaetes, especially Enchytraeidae, and fewer polychaetes. This study represents the first published description that we are aware of for macrofauna in S. foliosa vegetated marsh sediments. The findings document faunal variation among southern California embayments and suggest that differences in macrobenthic community structure occur between marsh and mudflat habitat as web as between east and west coast Spartina marshes. Observed differences may have significant implications for wetland conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - The invasive species Spartina alterniflora show a significant coexistence zonation pattern with local Phragmites australis in different mixture ratio, increasing the difficulty to monitor their distribution directly by remote sensing. Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is an important indicator to monitor the growth and physiological status. The objective of this study was to estimate CCC under different mixture ratio. Five spectral indices were selected and combined via back propagation (BP) neural network model for estimating CCC. Combining multi-indices yielded better results (R-2 = 0.7729, RAISE = 53.01 ug.cm(-2)) on average than the best single spectral index (R-2 = 0.7190, RAISE = 63.53 ug.cm(-2)) without distinguishing interspecies competition, with a total increase of 7.5% in the R-2 and a decrease of 16.56% in the RAISE. Meanwhile, when considering interspecies competition, the estimating results obtained by the BP neural network model achieved a further improvement of the R-2 value, ranging from 3.57% to 20.37%, while the prediction error reduced at varying degrees (maximum reduction of 23.78%). The results indicate that combining multi-indices by BP neural network model can alleviate the influence of interspecies competition and achieve higher estimating accuracy.

AB  - Growth, senescence and decomposition rates of Scirpus maritimus were studied in a Mediterranean brackish wetland. Plant tussocks were tagged in March, 2002 and were totally dead by September, 2002. Decomposition rates were determined over 360 days using litter bag technique and mass loss, nutrient dynamics fungal biomass, meiofauna and macroorganisms were determined. Decomposition rate of detached S. maritimus litter was 0.00196 (k, day(-1)) with a 54% of mass lost observed in 1 year. The pattern of mass loss was characterized by an initial phase of fast loss of organic matter with high density of meiofauna and a decrease of oxygen content, followed by two slower phases, with no significant losses from 50 to 180 days and with 21% of mass lost from 180 to 360 days. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content of plant litter increased during decomposition process whereas atomic C:N and C: P ratios decreased suggesting a nutrient immobilization on plant detritus. Fungal biomass measured as ergosterol content decreased after submersion of leaves, indicating that their importance in litter decomoposition decreases in submerged leaves during the first days of decomposition. An inverse relationship (r=-0.79, P < 0.005) was observed between ergosterol content and nematodes density on S. maritimus litter. Our results suggest that in Mediterranean brackish marshes, where large amounts of dead organic matter is accumulated over the sediment surface, decomposition process is greatly affected by extremely high temperatures in summer that, if water is available, accelerates microbial activity decreasing oxygen content thus slowing decomposition.

AB  - Mangroves are blue carbon ecosystems that sequester significant carbon but release CO2, and to a lesser extent CH4, from the sediment through oxidation of organic carbon or from overlying water when flooded. Previous studies, e.g. Leopold et al. (2015), have investigated sediment organic carbon (SOC) content and CO2 flux separately, but could not provide a holistic perspective for both components,of blue carbon. Based on field data from a mangrove in southeast Queensland, Australia, we used a structural equation model to elucidate (1) the biotic and abiotic drivers of surface SOC (10 cm) and sediment CO2 flux; (2) the effect of SOC on sediment CO2 flux; and (3) the covariation among the environmental drivers assessed. Sediment water content, the percentage of fine-grained sediment (<63 mu m), surface sediment chlorophyll and light condition collectively drive sediment CO2 flux, explaining 41% of their variation. Sediment water content, the percentage of fine sediment, season, land form setting, mangrove species, sediment salinity and chlorophyll collectively drive surface SOC, explaining 93% of its variance. Sediment water content and the percentage of fine sediment have a negative impact on sediment CO2 flux but a positive effect on surface SOC content, while sediment chlorophyll is a positive driver of both. Surface SOC was significantly higher in Avicennia marina (2994 +/- 186 g m(-2), mean +/- SD) than in Rhizophora stylosa (2383 +/- 209 g m(-2)). SOC was significantly higher in winter (2771 +/- 192 g m(-2)) than in summer (2599 +/- 211 g m(-2)). SOC significantly increased from creek-side (865 +/- 89 g m(-2)) through mid (3298 +/- 137 g m(-2)) to landward (3933 +/- 138 g m(-2)) locations. Sediment salinity was a positive driver of SOC. Sediment CO2 flux without the influence of biogenic structures (crab burrows, aerial roots) averaged 15.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in A. marina stands under dark conditions, lower than the global average dark flux (61 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) for mangroves.

AB  - The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta was reclaimed in the late 1800s when levees were built to convert this then tidal marshland into agricultural tracts and islands. Since then, land-surface elevations have declined, or subsided, by as much as 6 m. The spatial variability and causes of subsidence of organic soils in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were evaluated by analyzing historical leveling data and changes in land-surface elevations relative to powerpole foundations. Analysis of the historical leveling data indicate that subsidence rates are slowing, and the spatial variability in subsidence rates was largely explained by differences in soil organic matter content.
   The relation between land subsidence and organic matter oxidation was evaluated by measuring the gaseous and aqueous carbon flux and land-surface elevation changes in drained agricultural fields on three Delta islands. From July 1990 to May 1992, monthly gaseous CO2 fluxes were measured. The CO2 flux was used as an indicator of organic matter oxidation. Dissolved carbon fluxes were determined from the dissolved carbon loads in drainage ditches. Land-surface elevation changes were measured continuously by extensometers. The CO2 flux was strongly affected by soil temperature and also was related to the thickness of organic soils and soil moisture. Land-surface elevation fluctuated elastically with changes in ground-water elevation. The net, rates of inelastic subsidence ranged from 0.46 to 1.06cm/yr, Subsidence calculated from the CO2 fluxes generally agreed with subsidence measured during the monitoring period and explained about 60-76 percent of the variance in inelastic changes in land-surface elevation measurements, Estimates of dissolved organic carbon flux for all three islands were small relative to gaseous CO2 losses and represent less than 1 percent of the measured subsidence.
   To evaluate the hypothesis that converting drained agricultural areas into wetlands could aid in subsidence mitigation by slowing the oxidation. of the organic soils, carbon mass balances were determined on plots that were seasonally flooded, seasonally flooded and irrigated, and permanently flooded. Average fluxes were not significantly different between the irrigated and seasonally flooded plots. The carbon flux from the permanently flooded plot was about five times lower than the fluxes from the seasonally flooded and irrigated plots. Methane (CH4) was the primary gaseous carbon species in the permanently flooded plot.
   Carbon inputs were determined by harvesting and analyzing the accumulated, vegetative biomass. There was a net carbon gain in the permanently flooded plot and a net carbon loss in the irrigated and seasonally flooded plots. The net carbon gain and the field observation of vegetative accretion in the permanently flooded plot indicate that permanent flooding may be a way to reverse the effects of subsidence in the delta.

AB  - Estuaries provide crucial foraging resources and nursery habitat for threatened populations of anadromous salmon. As such, there has been a global undertaking to restore habitat and tidal processes in modified estuaries. The foraging capacity of these ecosystems to support various species of out-migrating juvenile salmon can be quantified by monitoring benthic, terrestrial, and pelagic invertebrate prey communities. Here, we present notable trends in the availability of invertebrate prey at several sites within a restoring large river delta in Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A. Three years after the system was returned to tidal influence, we observed substantial additions to amphipod, copepod, and cumacean abundances in newly accessible marsh channels (from 0 to roughly 5,000-75,000 individuals/m(2)). In the restoration area, terrestrial invertebrate colonization was dependent upon vegetative cover, with dipteran and hymenopteran biomass increasing 3-fold between 1 and 3 years post-restoration. While the overall biodiversity within the restoration area was lower than in the reference marsh, estimated biomass was comparable to or greater than that found within the other study sites. This additional prey biomass likely provided foraging benefits for juvenile Chinook, chum, and coho salmon. Primary physical drivers differed for benthic, terrestrial, and pelagic invertebrates, and these invertebrate communities are expected to respond differentially depending on organic matter exchange and vegetative colonization. Restoring estuaries may take decades to meet certain success criteria, but our study demonstrates rapid enhancements in foraging resources understood to be used for estuary-dependent wildlife.

AB  - The most important mercury species in the environment is monomethylmercury (MMHg), the topic of this chapter. This organic mercury compound is normally not released into the environment but formed by natural processes. Mercuric mercury (Hg2+) is methylated by bacteria and to a lesser extent through abiotic pathways. Highest rates of formation are found in anoxic aquatic environments. Terrestrial systems are mostly irrelevant for MMHg production and not a concern. Most productive environments are sediments, wetlands, and coastal marshes, but also the anoxic hypolimnion of lakes and anaerobic microhabitats like the rhizosphere of floating macrophytes. Prime suspects for methylation are sulfate-reducing bacteria, although also iron reducers have lately been identified as capable mercury methylators. What makes methylmercury such an insidious contaminant is its enormous biomagnification potential. Methylmercury is accumulated by more than seven orders of magnitude from sub ng/L concentrations in water to over 1,000,000 ng/kg in piscivorous fish, which are the main concern from a human health point of view. Since methylmercury is a very potent neurotoxin, particularly small children, pregnant women, and women in childbearing age are advised to either limit their fish consumption to a few meals per week or to select fish species known to have low levels of methylmercury. Formation of methylmercury is counteracted by other bacteria, which are capable of demethylating methylmercury. This process is regulated by an inducible flier operon system and serves as a detoxification mechanism in polluted environments. The other naturally occurring organic mercury species, dimethylmercury (DMHg), is only present at very low levels at great depths in the world oceans. However, it might be an important and very mobile pre-cursor for methylmercury in marine and polar ecosystems.

AB  - The relations among marsh elevation, flooding frequency and duration, and marsh accretion in a Spartina alterniflora marsh in coastal Louisiana were evaluated over a 39-month period by using held surveys, tide gauge records, and direct measures of recent accretion above artificial soil markers. New sample plots were randomly selected at the beginning of each of two time periods, April 1988-March 1990 (Period 1) and December 1989-July 1991 (Period 2), and vertical accretion was measured seasonally during both periods. Hydroperiod was calculated for each plot by using the mean elevation of the marsh surface at each plot and local tide gauge records. The range in elevations of the Period 1 field plots (2.1 cm) differed considerably from Period 2 field plots (12.1 cm). Marsh surface topography exerted a strong influence on the frequency and duration of marsh surface flooding, with plots at lower elevations flooded a greater percentage of the time than plots at higher elevations (41 vs. 37% for Period 1; 73 vs. 50% for Period 2). Accretion was significantly related to duration of flooding during both periods (p = 0.037, Period 1; p = 0.019, Period 2). Accumulation of both organic and mineral matter was also significantly related to duration of flooding (p = 0.007, organic; p = 0.009, mineral), implying that allochthonous organic matter as well as mineral matter was delivered to the marsh surface during flooding. These data indicate that accretion and accumulation varied temporally and spatially in relation to hydroperiod and suggest that accretion at lower marsh elevations is not always sufficient to maintain an equilibrium position in the intertidal zone.

AB  - This paper aimed to explore the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the contents and structure of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP), and dissolved organic sulphur (DOS)) in the Yanghe estuary, by the aid of ultraviolet-visible spectrum, three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Soil samples were collected at 0-60 cm depths in different invasion years (0, 1, 5, and 8). The results showed that the DOC increased gradually with the increase of invasion time of S.alterniflora; whereas the contents of DON and DOP decreased. In the vertical section, all the DOM showed a decreasing trend with the increase of the soil profile except the DOC content in SAF-5 and SAF-8 plots (The SAF-5 and SAF-8 represent for the invasion time of 5 years and 8 years). The spectral analysis showed that the macromolecules of DOM increased after the invasion. The molecular weight and number of molecules of DOM changed after invasion. The changes were mainly concentrated in refractory macromolecules. S.alterniflora had a significant effect on the number of structural units and functional groups of soil DOM. The intensity of functional group peaks became stronger, and aromatic, aliphatic, and carbohydrate substances increased. In addition, the quantity and quality of soil DOM input by S.alternifolia strongly affect the complexity of DOM chemical structure. With the increase of invasion time, the degree of humification increases and the structure of DOM tends to be more complex. The findings of this study indicate that the invasion of S.alternifolia would enhance DOM owing to greater amount of biomass.

AB  - Many studies have found that plant invasion can enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) pools, by increasing net primary production (NPP) and/or decreased soil respiration. While most studies have focused on C input, little attention has been paid to plant invasion effects on soil respiration, especially in wetland ecosystems. Our study examined the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil respiration and C dynamics in the Yangtze River estuary. The estuary was originally occupied by two native plant species: Phragmites australis in the high tide zone and Scirpus mariqueter in the low tide zone. Mean soil respiration rates were 185.8 and 142.3 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and P. australis stands in the high tide zone, and 159.7 and 112.0 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in S. alterniflora and S. mariqueter stands in the low tide zone, respectively. Aboveground NPP (ANPP), SOC, and microbial biomass were also significantly higher in the S. alterniflora stands than in the two native plant stands. S. alterniflora invasion did not significantly change soil inorganic carbon or pH. Our results indicated that enhanced ANPP by S. alterniflora exceeded invasion-induced C loss through soil respiration. This suggests that S. alterniflora invasion into the Yangtze River estuary could strengthen the net C sink of wetlands in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Experiments were performed seasonally to estimate grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, grazing on the epiphytic microalgae of cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and to determine if grass shrimp have the potential to regulate epiphyte abundance. Grass shrimp were given access to live culms with low and high epiphytic abundance and standing-dead culms collected from the streamside levee of a Louisiana salt marsh. Plexiglas frames were used to hold calms upright in aquaria and to restrict grass shrimp access to one half of each culm. We compared epiphyte biomass on the sides of culms exposed to shrimp with the corresponding unexposed sides. Epiphytes were removed from the lowest 10 cm. of culms on days 0, 3, and 10, and chlorophyll a (chl a) measurements on each culm half were made by fluorometry. Chl a biomass on culm halves not exposed to grass shrimp significantly increased over time. Percent reductions in chl a on culm halves exposed to grass shrimp (calculated by subtraction from the corresponding half not exposed to shrimp) significantly increased over time for at least one culm type in all seasons. Grass shrimp caused an average 30% reduction of epiphyte biomass over 3 d and a 40% reduction over 10 d, suggesting that grass shrimp have the capability of consuming a substantial proportion of the daily production of epiphytes. Epiphytes from standing-dead culms may be more important than those from live culms at the marsh edge to the diet of grass shrimp because chl a biomass was, on average, high, and standing-dead culms were seasonally abundant. Diagnostic photosynthetic pigments from selected culms, grass shrimp gut contents, and fecal pellets were identified by high performance liquid chromatography and were used to quantify the taxonomic groups of epiphytic microalgae. Results suggested that diatoms, brown algae, green algae, red algae, and cyanobacteria were present on all culms. Similarities in the pigment content of grass shrimp gut contents and fecal pellets suggested that all algal groups were ingested. Pigment data analysis could not detect a change in the composition of the microalgal assemblage associated with grass shrimp grazing. Assuming that the reduction in chl a was due exclusively to grazing, grass shrimp consumed an average of 0.5-1.5 g epiphyte carbon shrimp(-1) d(-1), suggesting that grass shrimp benefit significantly from the consumption of S. alterniflora epiphytic algae.

AB  - We measured the exchange of inorganic nutrients and particulate matter between the Spartina alterniflora marshes and the adjacent estuary of Cumberland Island, Georgia, USA, beginning in January 1991. Tidal fluxes were quantified using throughflow flumes at 3 sites within 10 km of one another. These sites represent a spatial gradient in geologic age, sediment characteristics, marsh topography and elevation, and exposure to open water that is often found in transgressive marsh-barrier complexes. They exhibited large variability in frequency and duration of tidal inundation and in susceptibility of the marshes to wind and wave erosion. The flumes were sampled seasonally and on consecutive days, and we present flux data from 7 samplings. We also investigated short-term temporal variability in nutrient and particulate fluxes by sampling one flume 4 times in 6 days. Temporal variability in total and organic suspended sediment fluxes, which was largely related to quickly changing wind and wave conditions, was greater than spatial variability measured during the same time. Dissolved constituent fluxes were generally more variable across space, suggesting that day-to-day variability in dissolved nutrient exchanges was not a major contribution to spatial variability. Dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes (as ammonium, nitrate+nitrite, and soluble reactive phosphorus) followed a spatial pattern of highest nutrient uptake at the geologically young marsh site. This marsh also consistently imported dissolved organic carbon. This site has the lowest absolute elevation of the 3 sites and a ramp-like topographic profile, and its young geologic age suggests that it is also ecologically immature. Fluxes of dissolved constituents at this site were negatively related to the area of marsh inundated, switching to export when large areas of the young marsh were inundated for long periods of time. This marsh also generally exported total and organic sediments; data from the other 2 sites were more variable. Sediment fluxes from the older marsh sites were positively related to slack high tide water level and area inundated, switching from particulates release to uptake only when the highest portions of these marshes were inundated. Most Cumberland Island marshes thus appear to take up sediments only when tidal heights exceed about 2.3 m above National Geodetic Vertical Datum, corresponding to tides where the moon is within 20 % of new or full phase, Our data also suggest definite differences in the way the geologically young marshes interact with the inundating water column compared to geologically older marshes in the same estuarine system.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are increasingly being converted into canal estates with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. We compared the sources and fate of organic matter and water quality at four types of canal habitats (entrances and ends of canals, canal lakes and lake edges) and shallow and deep natural habitats (four replicates of each habitat). The fate of labile organic matter was assessed by measuring rates of scavenging of carrion. Surface sediments were analysed for organic carbon content and stable carbon isotopes, fatty acid biomarkers and compound specific stable isotope analysis of selected fatty acids were used to elucidate sources of sedimentary organic matter. Canal lakes differed from other habitats and were characterised by negligible scavenging, larger quantities of organic matter comprised of higher contributions from diatoms, and hypoxia. Despite some trends, natural habitats were statistically indistinguishable from canal entrances and ends. Variation among replicate habitats was large.

AB  - Coastal meadows provide a wide range of ecosystem services worldwide. In order to better target conservation efforts in these ecosystems, it is necessary to develop highly accurate models that account for the spatial nature of ecosystem structure, processes and functions. In this study, above-ground biomass was predicted at very high spatial resolution in nine study sites in Estonia. A combination of UAV-derived datasets were used to produce vegetation indices and micro topographic models. A random forest algorithm was used to generate above-ground biomass maps and assess the contribution of each predictor variable. The model successfully predicted above-ground biomass at very high accuracies. Additionally, grassland structural heterogeneity was assessed using UAV-derived datasets and vegetation indices. The results were subsequently related to management history at each study site, showing that continuous, monospecific grazing management tends to simplify grassland structure, which could in turn reduce the supply of a key regulation and maintenance ecosystem services: nursery and reproduction habitat for waders. These results also indicate that UAV-based surveys can serve as reliable grassland monitoring tools and could aid in the development of site-specific management strategies.

AB  - In order to accurately estimate the effects of tidal scenarios on the CH4 emission from tidal wetlands, we examined the CH4 effluxes, dissolved CH4 concentrations, and environmental factors (including in situ pH, Eh and electrical conductivity, porewater SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) during inundation and air-exposure periods in high- and low-tide seasons in the Min River Estuary in southeast China. By applying static and floating chambers, our results showed that the CH4 effluxes during the inundation periods were relatively constant and generally lower than those during the air-exposed periods in both seasons. When compared, the CH4 effluxes during the air-exposed periods were significantly higher in the high-tide season than those in the low-tide season. In contrast, CH4 effluxes during the inundation periods were significantly lower in the high-tide season than those in the low-tide season. During the inundation periods, dissolved CH4 concentrations were inversely proportional to in situ Eh. Under air-exposed conditions, CH4 effluxes were proportional to in situ pH in both seasons, while the dissolved CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with the porewater SO42- concentrations in both seasons. Our results highlighted that CH4 effluxes were more dynamic between inundation and air-exposure periods compared to low- and high-tide seasons.

AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a structural parameter that plays a major role in modeling the exchange of energy, carbon dioxide, water, and other matter between plants and their surrounding environment. Direct means of measuring LAI are time-intensive and laborious, making indirect LAI retrieval methods desirable. In this study, we developed a method for retrieving structural metrics of erectophile plants that relies on open-source structure from motion software. We achieved this using a novel goniometer system to simultaneously retrieve high-resolution digital imagery and bidirectional spectroscopy measurements of Spartina alterniflora in a laboratory environment during both peak and late growing season. Retrieved LAI metrics correlated well with directional measurements of the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index 2 (MCARI2). Across all planting densities, the magnitude of the MCARI2 exhibited a high degree of variance, which depended on sensor viewing angle. MCARI2 values in the peak growing season were significantly higher. This result suggests that the MCARI2 metric is sensitive to seasonal changes in plant growth and senescence. We observed a high correlation between the LAI(contac)t values and the Total MCARI2 metric for the peak growth state plantings of R-2 = 0.9, suggesting that summing multiple directional measurements of MCARI2 potentially provides a more accurate assessment of LAI and compensates for observed variance in MCARI2 as a function of sensor orientation. Future work will focus on validating the observed effects across a broader range of plant species.

AB  - Purpose It is still controversial which type of plant litter is conducive to soil organic carbon (SOC) formation. Here we are to explore the conversion of organic carbon (OC) from decayed plant litter in soil and its influence on final SOC sequestration. Materials and methods In situ investigation combined with laboratory soil incubation experiments were conducted in mixing zones dominated by halophytes of Phragmites communis and Spartina alterniflora in the Jiuduansha wetland of the Yangtze River estuary to investigate differences in conversion patterns of OC from two decayed plant litters of different characteristics using traditional physicochemical indicators and stable isotope tracing. Additionally, the mechanism of biotransformation was investigated through analysis of soil microbial community structure. Results and discussion Due to the higher content of lignin and cellulose in P. communis litter, the associated soil microbial community was more conducive to the formation of soil humus (HS). By contrast, more easily decomposable S. alterniflora litter induced its related soil microbial community more amenable to mineralization. Consequently, OC from decayed S. alterniflora litter remained in soil for less time than that from decayed P. communis, and the lost OC was more readily converted into CO2. OC from decayed P. communis was degraded very slowly during the early stage of conversion (November), and its longer duration in soil was favorable for HS formation. Conclusions Analysis of the conversion of intermediates derived from different types of decayed plants can provide insight into plant litter input and SOC formation, and indicate the whereabouts of lost OC. From the perspective of plant biomass and conversion of plant litter-derived OC, P. communis is more conducive to soil carbon sequestration than S. alterniflora.

AB  - We measured soil organic matter (SOM) concentrations in a large sample (n = 95) of freshwater emergent and open water wetlands in the Portland, Oregon, USA, area as part of a study of the ecological development of mitigation wetlands. Mean SOM concentrations were higher in naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) than in mitigation wetlands (MWs) at 0-5 cm (SOM = 9.75 and 5.83%, respectively, p = 0.0001) and at 15-20 cm (SOM = 6.85, 4.68%, p = 0.0551). If temporal accumulation of SOM is occurring, it is slow; we found no significant relationship between SOM and wetland age (p = 0.6003) and no significant change in SOM concentration in soils in MWs sampled in 1987 and 1993. Concentrations of SOM were not significantly related to land use but were related to soil series, texture class, and association, and to hydrogeomorphic class. For a subset of wetlands monitored for hydrology, we also found a significant negative relationship between SOM and the extent of inundation by standing water. Mitigation may be leading to direct loss of SOM, probably resulting from soil management practices during project construction. We also show that hydrologic regime significantly affects SOM. Because most projects in our study were built in pre-existing wetlands and have extensive areas of open water, our results suggest that low concentrations of SOM are likely to persist. For SOM and probably for SOM-supported wetland functions, fundamental goals of mitigation and wetland management (in-kind wetland replacement, no-net-loss of structure and function) are not being achieved, at least in the short term. The success of mitigation, in terms of SOM, could be improved by better project design and better management of soils during project construction.

AB  - The roles of co-occurring herbivores that modify habitat structure and ecosystem processes have seldom been examined in manipulative experiments or explored in early successional communities. In a created marsh in southern California (USA), we tested the individual and combined effects of two epibenthic invertebrates on nutrient and biomass pools, community structure, and physical habitat features. We manipulated snail (Cerithidea californica) and crab (Pachygrapsus crassipes) presence in field enclosures planted with pickleweed (Salicornia virginica) at elevations matching the plant's lower extent in an adjacent natural marsh. In the 4-month experiment, C. californica altered habitat structure by reducing sediment surface heterogeneity and shear strength (a measure of sediment stability) markedly throughout the enclosures. Both invertebrates had strong negative effects on a group of correlated sediment physicochemical characteristics, including nitrogen and organic matter concentrations and soil moisture. In addition, both invertebrates greatly reduced benthic chlorophyll a, a proxy for biomass of microphytobenthos. Compared to controls, macroalgal cover was up to sixfold lower with crabs present, while snails increased cover at low elevations of enclosures. Unexpectedly, macroalgal cover was eliminated with both species present, perhaps through P. crassipes consumption of larger thalli and C. californica reduction in cover of recruits. Neither species influenced the S. virginica canopy (quantified with an index of branch length and number); however, at the lower elevation of enclosures, the two species together negatively impacted the plant canopy. The two invertebrates' modifications to our experimental marshes led to distinct suites of biotic and physicochemical features depending on their presence or co-occurrence, with the latter producing several unexpected results. We propose that the roles and interactions of habitat-modifying fauna deserve further attention, particularly in the context of efforts to conserve and restore the processes found in natural systems.

AB  - Lack of basic understanding of ecosystem structure and function forms a major impediment to successful conservation of coastal ecosystems. This paper provides a description of the fauna and examines faunal succession in Salicornia-vegetated sediments of southern California. Environmental attributes (vegetation and sediment properties) and macrofaunal (animals greater than or equal to 0.3 mm) community structure were examined in sediments of five natural, southern California Salicornia spp. marshes (Tijuana Estuary, San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, Upper Newport Bay and Anaheim Bay) and in created Salicornia marshes 16 months to 10 years in age, located within four of the bays. Oligochaetes and insects were the dominant taxa in both natural (71 to 98% of total fauna) and created (91 to 97%) marshes. In San Diego, Newport and Anaheim Bays, macrofaunal densities were generally higher in the created marshes (88 000 to 290 000 ind m(-2)) than in their natural counterparts (26 000 to 50 000 ind m(-2)). In the youngest system, Mission Bay, the reverse was true (natural: 113 000 vs created: 28 000 ind m-2). Similar species numbers were recorded from the created and adjacent natural marshes. Insects, especially chironomids, dolichopodids, and heleids, as well as the naidid oligochaete, Paranais litoralis, characterize early successional stages. Enchytraeid and tubificid oligochaetes reflect later succession evident in natural and older created marshes. Sediment organic matter (both combustible and below-ground plant biomass) was the environmental variable most commonly associated with densities of various macrofaunal taxa. These relationships were generally negative in the natural marshes and positive in the created marshes. Within-bay comparisons of macrofauna from natural Salicornia- vs Spartina-vegetated habitat in San Diego and Mission Bays revealed lower macrofaunal density (San Diego Bay only), proportionally fewer oligochaetes and more insects, and no differences in species richness in the Salicornia habitat. The oldest created Salicornia marsh (San Diego Bay) exhibited an assemblage intermediate in composition between those of the natural Salicornia- and Spartina-vegetated marshes. These results suggest: (a) faunal recovery following Salicornia marsh creation can require 10 or more years, (b) high macrofaunal variability among bays requires marsh creation reference site selection from within the same bay, and (c) Spartina-based research should not be used for Salicornia marsh management decisions.

AB  - This study sought to investigate the influence of different land types on soil enzyme activities and identify the driving factors behind it. Three prevalent land cover types and one land use type by Qinghai Lake were selected (original wetland, natural grassland, recovered shrubland, and farmland), and the surface soil at a depth of 0-10cm was collected for analysis. The results indicated that soil organic carbon, active carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen content, microbial biomass, and soil hydrolase activity decreased, whereas phenol oxidase activity increased after converting the wetland into other land types. However, the differences in microbial biomass and enzyme activities between farmland and recovered shrubland were not significant. Similar trends in -glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were detected and these were more sensitive to the changes in land types. Soil carbon and nitrogen contents were shown to be responsible for the variability in hydrolase activity, with active carbon showing the strongest influence. Wetland conversion induces the loss of soil carbon and nitrogen stock, which may further decrease the availability of organic matter for microbes. A decrease in hydrolase activity and an increase in phenol oxidase activity may indicate shifts in organic carbon bioavailability after wetland conversion.

AB  - Wetland creation and restoration are frequently used to replace ecological functions and values lost when natural wetlands are degraded or destroyed. On many sites, restoration of ecological attributes such as secondary production, habitat/species diversity, and wetland soil characteristics do not occur within the first decade, and no long-term studies exist to document the length of time required to achieve complete restoration of wetland dependent functions and values. Characteristics of community structure (macrophyte aboveground biomass, macro-organic matter [MOM], benthic invertebrates) and ecosystem processes (soil development, organic C, N, and P accumulation) of two constructed Spartina alterniflora (Loisel) marshes (established 1971 and 1974) and paired natural S. alterniflora marshes in North Carolina were periodically measured during the past 25 yr. On constructed marshes, the macrophyte community developed quickly, and within 5 to 10 yr, aboveground biomass and MOM were equivalent to or exceeded corresponding values in natural marshes. After 15-25 yr, benthic infauna density and species richness were greater than in the natural marshes. Soil bulk density decreased, and organic C and total N increased over time in constructed marshes, but after 25 yr, soil organic C and N reservoirs were much smaller than in a 2000-yr-old natural marsh. Organic C accumulation was similar in constructed and natural marshes with 12-24% of the net primary production buried annually. Nitrogen accumulation was much higher in constructed marshes (7-12 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) than in natural marshes (2-5 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), reflecting the open biogeochemical cycles and paucity of N in these young ecosystems. Different ecological attributes develop at different rates, with primary producers achieving equivalence during the first 5 yr, followed by the benthic infauna community 5-10 yr later. Accumulation of soil nutrients to levels similar to those of reference marshes may require more time.

AB  - The exotic species smooth cordgrass (Spartina alternifiora) is recognized as an important invasive species in China, introduced about 40 years ago. The consistent smooth cordgrass invasion significantly modified the coastal ecosystem. Understanding the ecological succession and mechanisms of wetland soil ecosystems is essential for biological conservation after the landscape change resulting from the smooth cordgrass invasion. In this study, five different invasion stages of a 16-year smooth cordgrass invasion sequence were identified in a coastal wetland as no invasion, initial invasion, young invasion, mature invasion, and senescing invasion. The succession of macrofaunal communities and environments were investigated along the gradient of invasion stages. The infauna decreased, and the epifauna increased along the invasion sequence. The significant differences of the communities were detected among the mud flats experiencing different invasion stages. The initial and young invasion stages of smooth cordgrass possibly promote the macrofaunal biodiversity, but biodiversity decreased at mature and senescing invasion stages. The ecological effect of smooth cordgrass invasion on macrofauna depended on the species' traits and the invasion stage. The environmental properties co-varied with invasion stages, and varied significantly among selected habitats. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) strongly related to the smooth cordgrass coverage, stem density, and height. C/N was identified as the key factor for shaping the environment by principal components analysis, and TOC for regulating the macrofaunal community by canonical correspondence analysis. The succession of macrofaunal communities should be considered as a comprehensive response to the variations on environmental properties co-varying with smooth cordgrass invasion in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Analyses of radionuclide activity, particle size distribution, elemental composition and magnetic properties of saltmarsh and mudflat sediments from the eastern Irish Sea were undertaken in order to identify potential grain-size proxies which could aid long-term modelling of radionuclide activity in this area. Am-241 and Cs-137 concentrations were found to be highly dependent upon the presence of sediment finer than 5 phi, highlighting the need to utilize this fraction in preference to conventional normalization procedures which refer to the abundance of sediment finer than 4 phi. Analyses of potential grain-size proxies for radionuclide activity highlighted a similar grain-size association with respect to sediment magnetic properties. This was linked to the influence of organic carbon on microbial populations responsible for mineral magnetism. Regression analysis was employed to derive a method whereby radionuclide concentration can be predicted using magnetic data as a grain-size proxy, thereby facilitating the identification of spatial and temporal trends in activity data.

AB  - Release and microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from the macroalgae Ulva prolifera were studied in laboratory incubation experiments. The release of DOM and CDOM from Ulva prolifera was a rapid process, and hydrolysis played an important role in the initial leaching of the organic compounds from the algae. Bacterial activity enhanced the release of DOM and CDOM during degradation of the algae and utilization of the released organic compounds. It is calculated that 43 +/- 2% of the C and 63 +/- 3% of the N from Ulva prafera's biomass were released during the 20-day incubation, and 65 +/- 3% of the released C and 87 +/- 4% of the released N were utilized by bacteria. In comparison, only 18 +/- 1% of the algae's C and 17 +/- 1% of its N were released when bacterial activities were inhibited. The fluorescence characteristics of the CDOM indicate that protein-like DOM was the major organic component released from Ulva prolifera that was highly labile and biodegradable. Bacteria played an important role in regulating the chemical composition and fluorescence characteristics of the DOM. Our study suggests that the release of DOM from Ulva prolifera provides not only major sources of organic C and N, but also important food sources to microbial communities in coastal waters.

AB  - The structure and composition of benthic assemblages (organisms > 100 mu m) and the main factors which control them were studied in the coastal basins of the Emporda wetlands (NE Iberian Peninsula). Five coastal basins were sampled in three different conditions during one hydroperiod (1997-1998): (1) one month after the main autumnal inundation when the water level was high; (2) in the middle of the hydroperiod; and (3) when the basins were close to desiccation. Based on the hydrological pattern, three types of basins were distinguished: non-disturbed permanent waters (type 1), non-disturbed temporary waters (type 2), and disturbed temporary waters (type 3). These three types are in agreement with the classification result from the benthic assemblage composition. The type I basins, where more stable environmental conditions were found, had an assemblage characterised by a high density of individuals, total biomass and diversity. The assemblage of type 2 basins had lower richness and diversity values with little temporal variability. The high frequency of freshwater inputs in type 3 basins causes a high taxonomic singularity and high temporal variability of species richness and diversity. The main environmental parameters (salinity, sand percentage, total phosphorus from the sediment, and total organic carbon from the water) related to the structure of benthic assemblages, also discriminating three groups, were coincident with the three types derived from distinct hydrological patterns. Thus, water regime summarises the physical factors which ultimately determine benthic fauna.

AB  - Soils were collected from low tidal flats and high tidal flats of Shang shoal located upstream and Xia shoal located downstream with different tidal water qualities, in the Jiuduansha wetland of the Yangtze River estuary. Soil respiration (SR) in situ and soil abiotic and microbial characteristics were studied to clarify the respective differences in the effects of tidal water salinity and nutrient levels on SR and soil carbon sequestration in low and high tidal flats. In low tidal flats, higher total nitrogen (TN) and lower salinity in the tidal water of Shang shoal resulted in higher TN and lower salinity in its soils compared with Xia shoal. These would benefit beta-Proteobacteria and Anaerolineae in Shang shoal soil, which might have higher heterotrophic microbial activities and thus soil microbial respiration and SR. In low tidal flats, where soil moisture was high and the major carbon input was active organic carbon from tidal water, increasing TN was a more important factor than salinity and obviously enhanced soil microbial heterotrophic activities, soil microbial respiration and SR. While, in high tidal flats, higher salinity in Xia shoal due to higher salinity in tidal water compared with Shang shoal benefited gamma-Proteobacteria which might enhance autotrophic microbial activity, and was detrimental to beta-Proteobacteria in Xia shoal soil. These might have led to lower soil microbial respiration and thus SR in Xia shoal compared with Shang shoal. In high tidal flats, where soil moisture was relatively lower and the major carbon input was plant biomass that was difficult to degrade, soil salinity was the major factor restraining microbial activities, soil microbial respiration and SR.

AB  - Across the globe, areas of the floodplain have been converted to agricultural use - often at the expense of natural ecosystems. In Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to 'ponded pasture' for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands, increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds. Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be considered.
   This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation, using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota.

AB  - Across the coastal zone, rates of carbon and nutrient exchange are defined by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of individual estuarine systems. Elemental stoichiometry provides a mechanism for simplifying overlapping physical, chemical, and biological drivers into proxies that can be used to compare and monitor estuarine biogeochemistry. To this end, the seasonal and tidal variability of estuarine stoichiometry was examined over an annual cycle in North Inlet (NI), South Carolina. Surface samples for dissolved and particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were collected every 20days (August 2014 to August 2015) over a semi-diurnal tidal cycle. Dissolved nutrient flux estimates of an individual tidal creek were also made. Overall, the results demonstrated the dominance of seasonal versus tidal forcing on water column C:N:P stoichiometry. This seasonal behavior mediated the relative exchange of N and P into and out of the tidal creek and influenced the nutrient status index (NSI) of NI plankton communities. These communities were largely N deficient with the magnitude of this deficiency impacted by assumptions of inorganic versus organic plankton P demand and nutrient supply. Persistent N deficiency appeared to help drive the net import of N, while temporary P surplus likely drives its seasonal export. Combined, these results indicate that material delivery must be considered on seasonal time frames, as net annual fluxes do not reflect the short-term deliveries of C and nutrients into nearshore ecosystems.

AB  - Sediment cores were collected from five coastal wetlands along the North Sea (England and Netherlands) and Baltic Sea (Poland). Cs-137 dating was used to assess sediment accretion rates, including rates based on the Cs-137 peak from the 1986 accident at Chernobyl. Peaks from the Chernobyl fallout were found in cores from the Oder and Vistula Rivers in Poland, from the Eastern Scheldt in the Netherlands, and in one of the two cores from Stiffkey Marsh, U.K. No evidence of Chernobyl fallout was found in cores from Dengie Marsh, U.K. The Chernobyl Cs-137 peak serves as an excellent marker for short-term accretion rates because of its high activity. Vertical accretion rates (cm yr(-1)) based on 1963 and 1986 peaks were similar at most sites; differences may be due to large inputs of sediment from storms or recent accumulation of organic matter. Large differences in sediment characteristics and accretion rates were found between samples from Poland and western Europe. Vertical accretion rates over the period 1963-1986 ranged from 0.26 to 0.85 cm yr(-1) and from 0.30 to 1.90 cm yr(-1) over the 1986-1991 period. Vertical accretion rates for the period 1963-1991 were greater than the rates of relative sea-level rise for all cores, so it does not seem that any of these sites are in imminent danger of excessive flooding. The Chernobyl Cs-137 peak will be especially useful for studies of short-term (i.e. very recent) sedimentation in the near future and for comparisons of sediment processes over different time scales.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of coastal soils in China have changed due to the development of reclaimed stretches of coastline, which has a significant impact on the dynamics of organic carbon (OC) in the soils. We evaluated changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils in both a natural area and a reclaimed area along the coast of Rudong County, China, as well as the effects that these changes had on the OC content of the soils. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was used to determine which factors are most important for driving changes in soil OC at four sites from each area. According to dominant vegetation types, there were significant differences in soil physical and chemical properties and OC content between the reclaimed area and natural coastal area. The mean grain size and pH increased gradually with depth, and values were highest in reclaimed areas. Mean total N (TN), P, and S, salinity, water content, and soil OC were highest in natural areas and decreased with depth. The PLSR model determined that TN, silt content, and sand content were the most important factors affecting soil OC in the reclaimed area, whereas TN, clay content, and water content were important factors affecting soil OC dynamics in the natural coastal areas. This study provides important reference data for correctly assessing the role and status of coastal areas in the global carbon cycle.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of tidal brackish wetlands and how they may be affected by restoration methods are largely unknown. The New Jersey Meadowlands, a tidal brackish estuary system, have had a long history of pollution, hydrological alterations, multiple restoration and mitigation treatments since the early 1970ies. To understand the effects of restoration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in three urban tidal brackish wetland sites over three years: an organic matter amended restored site, a non-amended restored site and a natural (non-restored) wetland site. Our results showed all three sites to be a CO2 source in the wintertime reverting to a weak sink of CO2 in the summer and annually to be sources of CO2 for some of the sites for some of the time. However, the amended restored wetland was found to have the highest release of CO2. Annual destructive harvest of the major species at these wetlands (Spartina ssp and Phragmites australis) did not show significant differences in the aboveground net primary productivity and leaf area over the course of this study. Overall, aboveground biomass production of the three wetlands sites was within the expected range of tidal brackish marshes, but the sites differed in their NEE, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem production. This investigation suggests that CO2 uptake and potential subsequent carbon sequestration may be strongly affected by the management and restoration history of the wetlands, and in our case these wetlands are often acting as a source of CO2, and not as a sink, as may have been expected.

AB  - Tidal wetland restoration is commonly used to recover ecosystem functions and services that were lost when wetlands were diked for reclamation or management. Less research has been conducted on the response of invertebrate and fish assemblages to tidal restoration than on plants and physical attributes. Blacklock Marsh, a wetland in Suisun Marsh, USA, was once managed for waterfowl hunting and cattle grazing until its dike was breached, restoring full tidal action. We sampled water quality, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fishes in Blacklock Marsh, and compared these metrics to adjacent naturalistic waterways and to a managed wetland focused on waterfowl. Our goal was to compare food production and community assemblage on a restoring marsh to other types of nearby waterways. Blacklock Marsh had less chlorophyll-a and dissolved organic carbon than nearby dead-end sloughs and the managed wetland, less zooplankton biomass than the managed wetland, and lower fish diversity-with a fish assemblage dominated by non-native species-compared to all other waterways. The most abundant fish species in the restoring site, Mississippi silverside (Menidia audens), is a non-native fish and known predator of Delta smelt larvae (Hypomesus transpacificus), for which the restoration was targeted. Our research suggests that restoring tidal action to managed wetlands alone may worsen rather than improve conditions for at-risk and native fishes.

AB  - Coastal French Guiana lies within the vast mobile mudbelt that characterizes much of the S. American inner shelf downdrift of the Amazon River. Approximately similar to 15-20% of the Amazon sediment outfall moves NW along the Guianas, in part as a series of 20-25 coastal mud waves. Seasonal studies of a representative migrating mudwave located between Kourou and Sinnamary, French Guiana demonstrate that diagenetic properties and biogeochemical cycling are closely coupled to sedimentary dynamics and the refluxing of reduced components between the seabed, coastal facies, and well-oxygenated overlying water. An unsteady two-zone diagenetic regime is typically present in the shallow subtidal and low intertidal regions. A surficial layer, usually similar to 0.5-1 m thick, is nonsulfidic, highly reactive, and dominated by Fe, Mn cycling. This suboxic layer unconformably overlies more consolidated sediment in which net 4- reduction is often observed, and contracts shoreward toward the mangrove fringe as sediments stabilize and become bioturbated. The relatively stable intertidal flats are also sites of significant benthic primary production. Despite suboxic conditions over extensive intervals, anaerobic remineralization rates are high (SigmaCO(2) similar to 0.2-0.6 mM day(-1)), and often show little evidence of attenuation with depth. Integrated SigmaCO(2) fluxes are similar to 20-235 mmol m(-2) day(-1) (wet/dry season average similar to 120), far exceeding diffusive O-2 fluxes into the bottom. High reactivity ( similar to 0.08 day(-1)) and low C/N remineralization release ratios ( similar to 5.3) of decomposing material imply fresh substrate of marine origin. Most reduced solid phase Fe is present as nonpyritic authigenic Fe minerals (<20% Fe(II) is in pyrite), and low sedimentary C/S ratios ( similar to 6-8) reflect the generally nonsulfidic conditions. A broad range of tracers (e.g. Th-234 (t(1/2)=24 days), Pb-210 (t(1/2) = 22 years), seasonal Cl- profiles) and nonsteady state diagenetic models of pore water concentrations and oxidant-reductant relationships demonstrate that the upper 0.1-1 m of deposits are reworked and exchanged with overlying water on timescales of <10 days to seasonally. Thus, the seafloor acts as a massive suboxic batch reactor, entraining and processing reactive marine plankton, regenerating Fe, Mn oxides, exchanging metabolites and nutrients with the oxygenated water column, and generating suites of nonsulfidic authigenic minerals. The apparent paradoxical properties of high remineralization rate, low reductant content (C-org similar to 630 mumol g(-1)), and dominance of suboxic metal cycling are a direct consequence of frequent entrainment of highly reactive organic substrate and simultaneous regeneration of the major Fe oxidants in oxygenated water. The Amazon-Guianas mobile mudbelt is a zone of extraordinarily intense sedimentary and biogeochemical recycling, greatly exceeding stable coastal systems, such as salt marshes, in material exchange with the sea.

AB  - It is important to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from newly created and restored wetlands so that we learn how to design them to minimize these emissions. Spatial and temporal patterns of methane emissions were measured in three wetland marsh complexes in southwest Florida: a created freshwater marsh on a university campus, a restored brackish/salt marsh on the fringe of a mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) coastal swamp; and a natural freshwater marsh adjacent to a cypress (Taxodium distichum) strand. Non steady -state rigid chambers were used twice a day (morning and afternoon) on a monthly schedule for 13 months. The mean +/- standard error (median) of methane emissions from permanently and intermittently flooded areas were 124 +/- 47 (0) and 0.8 +/- 0.7 (0) g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the created freshwater marsh, and 58 +/- 14 (9.4) and 0.1 +/- 0.3 (0) g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the restored brackish marsh. Methane missions were 0.8 +/- 0.5 (0) g-CH4-C M-2 y(-1) in the intermittently flooded natural freshwater marsh that served as our control. In general, average methane emissions were higher from permanently than intermittently flooding areas (P<0.05); our data suggested that ebullition may have occurred in permanently flooding areas and caused up to 6.3 g-CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in pulses in the created marsh and 1.7 g-CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) in the restored marsh. Removing ebullition outliers, methane emission estimates decreased by onefourth to one-half the annual rates given above to 30 g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in permanent created freshwater marshes and 27 g-CH4-C m(-2) y(-1) in the restored brackish marshes. There were no significant differences in methane emissions from created, restored or natural marshes in intermittently flooding areas (P > 0.05). CH4 emissions exhibited strong quadratic and linear relationships with water depth when all sites were compared (P< 0.05), but no significant relationships with soil temperature or salinity. These results give useful information on ways to minimize methane emissions when creating and restoring wetlands. But these results should be only one of the considerations for wetland design as other ecosystem services should also be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - DHere we describe the first demonstration of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) as a practical alternative to batteries for a low-power consuming application. The specific application reported is a meteorological buoy (ca. 18-mW average consumption) that measures air temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and water temperature, and that is configured for real-time line-of-sight RF telemetry of data. The specific type of MFC utilized in this demonstration is the benthic microbial fuel cell (BMFC). The BMFC operates on the bottom of marine environments, where it oxidizes organic matter residing in oxygen depleted sediment with oxygen in overlying water. It is maintenance free, does not deplete (i.e., will run indefinitely), and is sufficiently powerful to operate a wide range of low-power marine-deployed scientific instruments normally powered by batteries. Two prototype BMFCs used to power the buoy are described. The first was deployed in the Potomac River in Washington, DC, USA. It had a mass of 230 kg, a volume of 1.3 m(3), and sustained 24 mW (energy equivalent of ca. 16 alkaline D-cells per year at 25 degrees C). Although not practical due to high cost and extensive in-water manipulation required to deploy, it established the precedence that a fully functional scientific instrument could derive all of its power from a BMFC. It also provided valuable lessons for developing a second, more practical BMFC that was subsequently used to power the buoy in a salt marsh near Tuckerton, NJ, USA. The second version BMFC has a mass of 16 kg, a volume of 0.03 m(3), sustains ca. 36 mW (energy equivalent of ca. 26 alkaline D-cells per year at 25 degrees C), and can be deployed by a single person from a small craft with minimum or no in-water manipulation. This BMFC is being further developed to reduce cost and enable greater power output by electrically connecting multiple units in parallel. Use of this BMFC powering the meteorological buoy highlights the potential impact of BMFCs to enable long term (persistent) operation of durable low-power marine instruments (up to 100 mW average power consumption) far longer than practical by batteries.

AB  - Experimental assessments of species vulnerabilities to ocean acidification are rapidly increasing in number, yet the potential for short-and long-term adaptation to high CO2 by contemporary marine organisms remains poorly understood. We used a novel experimental approach that combined bi-weekly sampling of a wild, spawning fish population (Atlantic silverside Menidia menidia) with standardized offspring CO2 exposure experiments and parallel pH monitoring of a coastal ecosystem. We assessed whether offspring produced at different times of the spawning season (April to July) would be similarly susceptible to elevated (similar to 1100 mu atm, pH(NIST) = 7.77) and high CO2 levels (similar to 2300 mu atm, pH(NIST) = 7.47). Early in the season (April), high CO2 levels significantly (p < 0.05) reduced fish survival by 54% (2012) and 33% (2013) and reduced 1 to 10 d post-hatch growth by 17% relative to ambient conditions. However, offspring from parents collected later in the season became increasingly CO2-tolerant until, by mid-May, offspring survival was equally high at all CO2 levels. This interannually consistent plasticity coincided with the rapid annual pH decline in the species' spawning habitat (mean pH: 1 April/31 May = 8.05/7.67). It suggests that parents can condition their offspring to seasonally acidifying environments, either via changes in maternal provisioning and/or epi genetic transgenerational plasticity (TGP). TGP to increasing CO2 has been shown in the laboratory but never before in a wild population. Our novel findings of direct CO2-related survival reductions in wild fish offspring and seasonally plastic responses imply that realistic assessments of species CO2-sensitivities must control for parental environments that are seasonally variable in coastal habitats.

TI  - Salt Marsh Primary Production and Its Responses to Relative Sea Level and Nutrients in Estuaries at Plum Island, Massachusetts, and North Inlet, South Carolina, USA
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
LA  - English
AB  - Feedbacks between flooding and plant growth that help to stabilize marshes against rising sea level are being investigated in estuaries at Plum Island, Massachusetts, and North Inlet, South Carolina. Net annual primary production of the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora has been quite variable through the years, and correlates positively with sea level during the growing season at both sites. The elevation of the marsh surface relative to mean high water determines the duration of flooding, or hydroperiod, that in turn affects plant growth. The effect of flooding was tested experimentally using an in situ bioassay to simulate growth at different relative elevations. At North Inlet, we found a parabolic response to relative elevation, with clear evidence of minimum and maximum vertical limits and an optimal elevation for growth. The Plum Island bioassay provided evidence of the super-optimal side of the growth curve. In both marshes, the responses of S. alterniflora to rising sea level, at their current elevations, are consistent with the bioassay results. This growth curve is important because it defines suboptimal elevations that are unstable for marshes and super-optimal elevations that are stable. Instability results when an increase in sea level decreases primary production, leading to declines in mineral sedimentation and sediment organic matter accretion. Conversely, stability results when rising sea level stimulates primary production, leading to increased sedimentation and organic matter accretion. There also has been interannual variability in the maximum standing biomass (a proxy for productivity) of another marsh grass, Spartina patens, but no significant correlation has been found with sea level, possibly due to methodological limitations. Finally, both Spartina species responded positively to nitrogen and have remained highly productive for 13 years of fertilization at Plum Island and 30 years at North Inlet.

AB  - Profile samples from 0 to 70 cm depth were collected in five plant zones along a hydrological gradient in a typical land/inland water ecotone, Northeast China. Total phosphorous (TP), organic phosphorous (OP), inorganic phosphorous (IP) and available phosphorous (AP) were measured to study their horizontal and vertical distribution patterns in the land/inland water ecotone, as well as their important influencing factors such as soil organic carbon (SOC) and water level. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TP, OP, IP and AP were generally higher in the flooding zone (zone A), the over-wetted zone (zone B) and the drying and wetting zone (zone C), but the drying zones (zones D and E) contained lower P concentrations. Soil P was mainly concentrated in upper soils (0-30 cm) and the P levels decreased with depth, except for small accumulative peaks in the 50 to 70 cm soil increment for TP and OP in zone C and for IP and AP in zone A. Surface soils in zones D and E had a lower mean SOC:OP ratio than zones A. B and C, reflecting the higher probability of OP mineralization in the drying zones. However, higher mean values of the IP:OP and AP:TP ratios were found in zone A (P<0.05), indicating that increasing soil moisture may be the most important agent determining IP release rate and biological availability. The significantly positive correlations with soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content would contribute to P retention in zones A. B and C (P<0.01) where the soils contained relatively high organic matter and clay content. The results obtained in this study suggest that the distributions and dynamics of P forms in soil, especially in the land/inland water ecotone, can be significantly impacted by various biogeochemical and environmental factors (i.e., soil moisture, SOM, and clay content).

AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured at a temperate cattail marsh using the eddy covariance technique in order to examine the relationships between NEE, weather, and vegetation properties. Analyses of CO2 fluxes for a complete year (May 9, 2005 to May 30, 2006) showed that the marsh wetland was a net CO2 sink for each month from June to September (monthly 24-h averages of -0.1, -5.1, -4.8, and -2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively) and a source of CO2 to the atmosphere for the remaining fall and winter months. Wintertime (November to April) average NEE was 0.5 g C m(-2) day(-1). The annual cumulative CO2 balance shows a net uptake of 264 g C m(-2) year(-1) by the marsh. Ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) were estimated to be 567 and 831 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Respiration rates were associated with a Q(10) value of 2.8. Peak aboveground biomass (average of 1156 g m(-2)) and peak green LAI (average of 3.63) were reached in mid-August. Variations in growing season NEE were well correlated with variations in live biomass (r = 0.92) and green LAI (r = 0.94). (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are critical ecosystems, and they are among the most threatened habitats on the planet. As an anthropogenic biotic invader, Spartina alterniflora Loisel. competes with native plants, threatens native ecosystems and coastal aquaculture, and may cause local biodiversity to decline. The distribution area of the exotic species S. alterniflora in the Yellow River Delta had been expanding to ca.4,000 ha from 1990 to 2018. In this study, we reported, for the first time, the competitive effects of the exotic plant (S. alterniflora) on seagrass (Zostera japonica Asch. & Graebn.) by field investigation and a transplant experiment in the Yellow River Delta. Within the first 3 months of the field experiment, S. alterniflora had pushed forward 14 m into the Z. japonica distribution region. In the study region, the area of S. alterniflora in 2019 increased by 516 times compared with its initial area in 2015. Inhibition of Z. japonica growth increased with the invasion of S. alterniflora. Z. japonica had been degrading significantly under the pressure of S. alterniflora invasion. S. alterniflora propagates sexually via seeds for long distance invasion and asexually by tillers and rhizomes for short distance invasion. Our results describe the invasion pattern of S. alterniflora and can be used to develop strategies for prevention and control of S. alterniflora invasion.

AB  - Several lines of evidence from the literature have pointed to the saltmarsh periwinkle (Littoraria irrorata [Say]) as a potentially important shredder of standing, decaying cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) shoots. Periwinkles prefer to ingest dead-shoot material and possess enzymes capable of lysis of cordgrass plant-structural and fungal-wall polymers. We offered natural, standing-dead leaf blades to periwinkles in an attempt to determine the rates at which the snails would rasp away and ingest material of the decaying-shoot system, and whether the snails would selectively remove living-fungal mass (measured as ergosterol) from the system. The larger snails tested (14 mm shell height) took 42% of the total organic mass of the blades during 6 days of exposure, and exhibited selectivity for fungal-occupied portions of blades by removing 69% of the living-fungal organic mass. Based on observed removal rates, about 2-3%.  day-1 of the organic mass of standing-dead leaf blades could be lost to snail grazing in marsh areas where the snails are most densely concentrated (> 400 individuals . m-2 of shell length > 5 mm). In a preliminary comparison of adjacent marsh areas of equivalent canopy height, the one without periwinkles had a 4 x greater standing crop of dead leaves. Periwinkles are likely to be important controlling agents of fungal standing crops and important shapers of fungal community dynamics in cordgrass marshes, in that the standing, decaying substratum for fungal growth and the potential for fungal species successions are radically changed by the snails' activities.

AB  - Nitrogen mineralization was evaluated using a 12-wk anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C in two wetland soils located in Xianghai National Nature Reserve, China. The Erbaifangzi wetland is an open wetland because it hydrologically connected to the surrounding ecosystem, whereas the Fulaowenpao wetland is a closed wetland, which is not hydrologically connected. Nitrogen mineralization was fitted to an effective cumulative temperature model. Nitrogen mineralization increased gradually with increases in the cumulative temperature and decreased with depth in the soil profile. Nitrogen mineralization was positively correlated with total N (TN) or soil organic matter (SOM), but not with soil pH. Basal N mineralization was found to be greater-in the Fulaowenpao wetland (0.314g N m(-2) d(-1)) than the Erbaifangzi wetland (0.230 g N m(-2) d(-1)).

AB  - Stable carbon isotope values of organic carbon have proven useful in identification of the salinity regime of marsh deposits in the Mississippi Delta plain. Using a mixing model and empirical measurements of the delta(13)C of marsh sediments, we show that carbon isotope analysis could be a useful technique on other coastlines. Estimates of the stable carbon isotope values from estuarine deposits along the west and east coast of the United States suggest that fresh and saline sediments each have a characteristic ''signature.'' Thus, stable carbon isotope values can provide valuable evidence of sea level fluctuations in these regions. Values of delta(13)C which depart from the predictive model could be caused by diagenetic processes (decomposition) and/or contribution from carbon sources not accounted for in the model. In assessing the relative importance of these factors, we find that complications are minimized when autochthonous carbon from algal production is not an important component of the sedimentary Organic matter.

AB  - Wetlands are highly effective systems in removing large amounts of N from waters, preventing eutrophication processes. However, when wetlands are polluted by metal-mine wastes their capacity to act as green filters may be diminished. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of liming and plants (Sarcocornia fruticosa and Phragmites australis) on the removal of NO3- from eutrophic water in slightly acidic, wetland soils polluted by metal-mine wastes. Simulated soil profiles were constructed and six treatments were assayed: (1) no liming + no plant, (2) no liming + S. fruticosa, (3) no liming + P. australis, (4) liming + no plant, (5) liming + S. fruticosa and (6) liming + P. australis. Three horizons were differentiated: A (never under water), Cl (alternating flooding-drying conditions) and C2 (always under water). The eutrophic water used to flood the soil profiles was enriched in N and organic carbon (pH similar to 7.5, electrical conductivity similar to 11 dS m(-1), NO3- similar to 234 mg L-1 and dissolved organic carbon 106 mg L-1). The pH, Eh and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), N-NO3- and N -NH4+ were measured regularly for 18 weeks. Liming stimulated the growth of plants, especially for S. fruticosa (20-fold more plant biomass than without liming), increased the soil pH and favoured the decline of the Eh values, enhancing the removal of NO3- via denitrification. Of all the treatments assayed, liming + S. fruticosa was the only treatment that removed almost completely the high concentration of NO3- from the eutrophic flooding water, reaching similar to 1 mg L-1 N-NO3- at the end of the experiment, at all depths. The higher content of DOC in the pore water of this treatment could explain this behaviour, since more labile carbon was available to the soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere, favouring NO3- removal through denitrification processes. However, the treatment liming + P. australis (2-fold more plant biomass that without liming) did not remove completely the high concentrations of NO3- from the eutrophic water, except in the C2 horizon - which was permanently under water. Hence, our results show that the effectiveness of liming, regarding the removal of NO3- from eutrophic flooding water in wetland soils polluted by metal-mine wastes, depends on the presence of plants, their growth and the production of organic compounds in the rhizospheric environment.

AB  - Shape, size and mineralogical/chemical compositions of carbonate concretions vary considerably. The questions to be answered are-Why do they form at all? What processes are involved? Why do they so often form as regular spheroids? Why do they sometimes form laterally-extensive bands? What controls whether the mineral composition is calcite, dolomite, rhodochrosite or siderite (or mixtures of them)? The questions are addressed and the answers illustrated by selected examples.
   Carbonate precipitation is the result of the sedimentary system exploiting the potential energy provided by juxtaposing oxidised detrital input with reducing agents (organic matter). Microbes take advantage of the energy source and are believed to be involved in most of the various processes.
   Pore waters in steadily-accumulated sediments show a depth-related succession of chemical and carbon stable-isotope compositions. This results from degradation of organic matter proceeding via an orderly succession of processes during burial, each mediated by a specific microbial group. Aerobic oxidation, using dissolved oxygen occurs first, followed by Mn(IV), reduced to Mn(II), as the oxidant. Fe(III) reduction and sulphate reduction are probably more significant. Methanogenesis is the final, deepest microbial process. The common product of all these reactions is CO2 or dissolved HCO3- which can result in carbonate supersaturation. The specific process controls the chemical and isotopic compositions of pore-water and leads to a characteristic mineralogy of any carbonate precipitated. However, the processes may not proceed successively and localised micro-environments occur. Recent work on siderite concretions in very young salt-marsh sediments (Norfolk, U.K.) has shown that microbial populations are not homogeneously distributed and that these localise and control concretionary growth.
   Concretions in ancient rocks can be described in terms of the same processes observed in modern sediments. Laterally-extensive siderite bands in Bullhouse Quarry (Westphalian, U.K.) resulted from interaction of two sets of complementary processes: shallow manganese and iron reduction coupled with deeper methanogenesis and decarboxylation. The model is supported by a mass and charge balance calculation. Similar, complementary processes formed spheroidal concretions (Gammon Shale, USA) but there is evidence that the outer shell of the concretion formed before the inner core and in the absence of a core the shell was crushed by burial compaction. The spheroidal form resulted from diffusion of reactive components controlled by the relative rates of the contributory processes.
   Calcite or dolomite analogues of the siderite concretions are formed by similar processes but inhibition of carbonate precipitation makes it impossible to use an equilibrium mass balance model. Kimmeridge Bay (UK) dolomite ledges are marine analogues to the Bullhouse examples. For the pyrite-rimmed calcite Jet Rock concretions (Early Jurassic, Yorkshire, U.K.) the rate of production of sulphide (from sulphate reduction) locally exceeded availability of Fe(II), to precipitate pyrite. Outward diffusion of sulphide produced the characteristic spheroidal shape of the concretion.
   Because of their developmental pattern bedded concretions are more likely to preserve a sequence of diagenetic cements which record the history of pore-water evolution. However, all represent an expression in ancient rocks of microbiological processes similar to those operating today.

AB  - Coastal soils are particularly sensitive to nonnative species invasion. In this context, spatially explicit soil information is essential for improving the knowledge of the role of soil in changing environments, supporting coastal sustainable management. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive opportunity to monitor soil because the acquisition of images is independent of weather and daylight. However, SAR has not been commonly used for soil prediction. In this study, we firstly investigated the temporal variation of vegetation canopy and the soil-vegetation relationship using Sentinel-1 data in an invaded coastal wetland. And then we built 3D models to predict soil properties at multiple depths. A total of 16 Sentinel-1 images were acquired in a growing season. A series of soil physicochemical properties were examined including soil bulk density, texture, organic/inorganic carbon, pH, salinity, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio, relating to three depth layers in the top 1-m depth. Our results showed that time-series Sentinel-1 data can capture temporal characteristics of vegetation, and VH/VV was more sensitive to the vegetation growth than VH and VV. The soil-vegetation relationship captured by time-series SAR data was beneficial to predict soil properties, especially for soil chemical properties. The models provided permissible prediction accuracy, with an average RPD of 0.99. We concluded that the prior understanding of the temporal variation of SAR data is essential for developing practical soil prediction strategy. Our results highlight that SAR has the potential to predict a diverse set of soil properties in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation cover.

AB  - We monitored coastal wetland vertical accretion, elevation gain and surface carbon (C) at Homebush Bay, Australia over 18 years (2000-2017) in three settings initially characterized by saltmarsh, mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone and mangrove-dominated zones. During this time, the saltmarsh transitioned to mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone, and the mixed saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone transitioned to mangrove, consistent with vegetation transitions observed across the east Australian continent in recent decades. In spite of mangrove recruitment and thickening in the former saltmarsh zone, and the dominance of mangrove root material as a contributing C source, the rate of C accumulation in the former saltmarsh zone did not change over the study period, and there was no significant increase in surface elevation. This contrasted with the response of sites with a longer history of mangrove colonization, which showed strong accretion and C accumulation over the period. The result suggests that the C accumulation and surface elevation gains made as a result of mangrove colonization may not be observable over initial decades, but will be significant in the longer term as forests reach maturity.

AB  - The soil microbial respiration (SMR) and physicochemical characteristics of Jiuduansha wetland at the Yangtze Estuary were analyzed in order to clarify the variability of SMR under different vegetation succession stages and its influencing factors. The results indicated that SMR of different vegetation succession stages are significantly various (P < 0.05). The SMR of the Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) zone (0.43 mgCO(2).g(-1).24h(-1)) was the highest. These findings implied that S. alterniflora could enhance the SMR. Based on both the SMR and input of organic matter from plant decay, the Phragmites australis (P. australis) community likely possesses a higher organic carbon accumulation capability. Considering both SMR and input of organic matter from decayed plant biomass of wetland with different vegetation type, the P. australis community, in theory, has higher organic carbon accumulation capability. Path analysis shows that the main bio-factors influencing on SMR include bacterial diversity and soil microbial biomass (SMB). Soil moisture, inorganic N (IN), salinity and available P (AP) in soil also have significant effects on the mentioned biological factors.

AB  - Tidal wetlands are effective carbon sinks, mitigating climate change through the long-term removal of atmospheric CO2. Studies along surface-elevation and thus flooding-frequency gradients in tidal wetlands are often used to understand the effects of accelerated sea-level rise on carbon sequestration, a process that is primarily determined by the balance of primary production and microbial decomposition. It has often been hypothesized that rates of microbial decomposition would increase with elevation and associated increases in soil oxygen availability; however, previous studies yield a wide range of outcomes and equivocal results. Our mechanistic understanding of the elevation-decomposition relationship is limited because most effort has been devoted to understanding the terminal steps of the decomposition process. A few studies assessed microbial exo-enzyme activities (EEAs) as initial and rate-limiting steps that often reveal important insight into microbial energy and nutrient constraints. The present study assessed EEAs and microbial abundance along a coastal ecotone stretching a flooding gradient from tidal flat to high marsh in the European Wadden Sea. We found that stabilization of exo-enzymes to mineral sediments leads to high specific EEAs at low substrate concentrations in frequently flooded, sediment-rich zones of the studied ecotone. We argue that the high background activity of a mineral-associated enzyme pool provides a stable decomposition matrix in highly dynamic, frequently flooded zones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that microbial communities are less nutrient limited in frequently flooded zones, where inputs of nutrient-rich marine organic matter are higher. This was reflected in both increasing exo-enzymatic carbon versus nutrient acquisition and decreasing fungal versus bacterial abundance with increasing flooding frequency. Our findings thereby suggest two previously unrecognized mechanisms that may contribute to stimulated microbial activity despite decreasing oxygen availability in response to accelerated sea-level rise.

AB  - This study reports an inventory of marsh dieback events from spatial and temporal perspectives in the North Inlet-Winyah Bay (NIWB) estuary, South Carolina (SC). Past studies in the Gulf/Atlantic coast states have reported acute marsh dieback events in which marsh rapidly browned and thinned, leaving stubble of dead stems or mudflat with damaged ecosystem services. Reported marsh dieback in SC, however, have been limited. This study identified all marsh dieback events in the estuary since 1998. With 20 annually collected Landsat images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series was extracted. A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder neural network was developed to identify the NDVI anomalies on the trajectories. All marsh dieback patches were extracted, and their inter-annual changes were examined. Results showed a continuous, spatially variable multi-year dieback event in 1998-2005, which aligned with the reported dieback in the early 2000s from other states. The identified patches mostly returned to normal within one year while the phenomenon reoccurred in other areas of the estuary during the prolonged dieback period. This study presents the first attempt to explore long-term dieback dynamics in an estuary using satellite time series. It provides valuable information in documenting marsh healthiness and environmental resilience on SC coasts.

AB  - Tidal zones are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. They play a number of keys roles with respect to the fauna and flora they host by recycling organic matter, and also by providing spawning, hatching and feeding grounds for marine species as well as birds. However they are being strongly impacted by human activities while their social value to mankind is not fully acknowledged.
   The last two severe oil spills that affected the coastal zone of France (Erika, Prestige) aroused a renewed interest for the coastal zone. This trend was supported by strong incentives by European regulations, namely the Habitats and Water framework directives. This new situation revealed a dramatic lack of knowledge of our tidal areas.
   Airborne LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technique that uses the return time of backscattered laser light to measure ground elevation with high efficiency and accuracy. The geometry of the airborne system is very precisely controlled by a GPS and an inertial navigation system. The rate of coverage is up to 40 km(2) per hour and the dot density reaches more than one per m(2). Horizontal and vertical accuracies are respectively about 30 cm and 15 cm on bare ground.
   Over the last few years, the use of LIDAR has become more common in integrated coastal zone management. Detailed mapping of the elevation of tidal areas has brought about advances in many applications, among which:
   - Hydrodynamic modelling, which is based on fine knowledge of the bathymetry. Modelling is an essential tool to simulate the dispersion and fate of contaminants run off from watersheds into the coastal zone or to assess the trophic capacity of coastal waters with respect to shellfish farming. Modelling can also be used to model sediment removal, transport and deposition. Several LIDAR surveys have recently been carried out in various sites of the French coast where hydrodynamic models using cell size in the range of 30m are operational such as Mont Saint Michel and Morbihan bays.
   - Tidal habitats mapping needs detailed knowledge of both the relief and facies. Since 2004, the French benthic monitoring network Rebent has been dealing with the detailed inventory of a network of coastal sites. By jointly interpreting elevation data from LIDAR and airborne ortho-imagery with the help of ground truth data, maps were produced describing sediment facies and habitat units to a high level of detail. Combined with a tidal model, a LIDAR terrain model also yields the flooding frequency, a key driver to the presence of sea weed belts or salt marsh vegetation.
   - Coastal morpho-dynamics are concerned with understanding coastline and seashore changes under natural or human pressure. Natural events include storm surges or sea level rise, while human impact can be from coastal developments or aggregate extraction but also from bio-deposition in shellfish fanning areas. Repeated LIDAR surveys would allow monitoring the rate of erosion/deposition on our coasts, hence providing help to risk management.

AB  - The magnitude of the outcome of ecosystem engineering is context-dependent; as environmental stresses increase, habitat amelioration by ecosystem engineers becomes more relevant. Moreover, the individual- and population-level traits of ecosystem engineers can affect their ability to reduce environmental stress. On the Patagonian shores of Argentina (SW Atlantic, 41 degrees S), the intertidal community is exposed to harsh conditions. We predicted that in this severe environment, variation in the above-ground structure of the smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora should buffer the physical stress on the substrate through shading and reduction of wind and water flow energy, ultimately affecting the sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated cordgrass density at the edge and inner marsh of a S. alterniflora meadow during both summer and winter. In summer, evaporation and temperature were higher in clipped plots, while in winter, evaporation varied across densities and location treatments, with higher sediment water content in the inner marsh. No effect of S. alterniflora density or location were observed on sediment organic matter or chl a concentration, and mean sediment grain size was always smaller inside the marsh. In summer, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content was higher in clipped plots inside the marsh, however this did not differ from the other density treatments at this location. Overall, shading had weak effects on sediment properties and microphytobenthic biomass, and most observed differences were attributable to grain size. We speculate that the harsh conditions of this system overwhelm the ecosystem engineering effects of S. alterniflora, probably because of its relatively small above-ground biomass.

AB  - The C3 grass species Scirpus maritimus L. and Puccinellia maritima (Huds.) Parl., and the C4 grass species Spartina anglica C.E. Hubbard and Spartina patens (Ait.) Muhl. were grown at ambient (340 p.p.m. CO2) and elevated (580 p.p.m. CO2) atmospheric CO2 concentration, at low (10 mM NaCl) and high salinity (250 mM NaCl) under aerated and anaerobic conditions in the culture solution.  The relative growth rate of both the C3 grass species was enhanced with atmospheric CO2 enrichment, no such increase was found in the C4 grass species.  High salinity reduced growth of the C3 species tested, but this relative growth reduction was not prevented by elevated CO2 concentration.  The growth increase at elevated CO2 of Scirpus maritimus and Puccinellia maritima is greater under aerated than under anaerobic solution conditions.  Water-use efficiency of all species was increased by elevated CO2.  In the case of Scirpus (C3), this increase was caused by increased net photosynthesis, for Spartina patens (C4) photosynthesis was not increased, but transpiration was reduced.  The water potential of the shoot was less negative under conditions of CO2 enrichment, in particular at increased salinity (250 mM NaCl).

AB  - Estuarine detritus-based food webs typically rely on diverse sources and timing of organic matter (OM) delivery. Access to detritus requires adequate hydraulic connectivity for consumer migration into productive locations and the transfer of allochthonous detritus into consumer habitats. These processes are particularly important to the patterns and rates of community development in restoring estuarine marshes where OM sources and connectivity might vary as a function of landscape setting. This study quantifies trophic dynamics in restoring and natural marsh ecosystems in the Skokomish estuary, Washington, USA, using Pacific blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus), stable isotopes, and a Bayesian multiple source mixing model to estimate available suspended food resources. The restoring marshes represent different ages since restoration implementation-14 and 3 years-as well as different restoration approaches-a levee breach and a full levee removal. Sestonic OM was less available and of lower quality in the two restoring marshes than in the natural marsh site. Mussel diets tracked seasonal trends in OM availability: Phytoplankton consumption was highest in spring, marsh detritus consumption was highest in winter (but consistently comprised at least 30 % of OM assimilated by mussels), and macroalgae consumption was highest in September. Trophic equivalency with mussels inhabiting the natural marsh appears to be restoring more rapidly in the younger restoration site, perhaps because increased hydrologic connectivity achieved through full levee removal promotes greater OM exchange compared to the single levee breach restoration approach. We conclude that increasing ecosystem capacity for detritus production by restoring emergent marsh ecosystems can bolster support for detritus-based food webs and suggest that restoration actions enhancing connectivity may achieve functional equivalency more rapidly than restoration projects exhibiting limited connectivity to the surrounding landscape.

AB  - Quantification of methane (CH4) gas emission from peat is critical to understand CH4 budget from natural wetlands under a climate warming scenario. Previous studies have focused on prediction and mapping of CH4 emission flux using process-based models, while application of statistical-empirical models for upscaling spatially sparse in situ measurements is scarce. In this study, we developed an empirical remote sensing upscaling approach to estimate CH4 emission flux in the Everglades using limited in situ point-based CH4 emission flux measurements and Landsat data during 2013-2018. We spatially and temporally linked in situ data with Landsat surface reflectance based on temporally composite data sets and developed an object-based machine learning framework to model and map CH4 emission flux. An ensemble analysis of two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), shows that the upscaling approach is promising for predicting CH4 emission flux with a R-2 of 0.65 and 0.87 based on a fivefold cross-validation for a dry season and wet season estimation, respectively. We generated emission flux map products that successfully revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CH4 emission within the dominant freshwater marsh ecosystem in the Everglades. We conclude that Landsat is promising for upscaling and monitoring CH4 emission flux and reducing the uncertainty in emission estimates from wetlands.

AB  - Providing a dense network of Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) records still faces some challenges, such as the paucity of microfossil assemblages within some Holocene sedimentary sequences. Recently, the isotopic (delta C-13) and elemental geochemistry [total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratios] of saltmarsh sediments has showed potential for RSL reconstruction. This study presents the results of new delta C-13, TOC and TN measurements obtained on surface sediments of two marshes of the Brittany region (France). Overall, the distribution of delta C-13, TOC, TN and C/N values shows clear dependencies with elevation. Sediments from above and below the high tide level show contrasting TN contents. Clustering analyses identified three elevation-dependent groups, characterized by specific values of delta C-13, TOC and TN. The use of this geochemical reference for RSL reconstruction is tested on a core retrieved from one of the marshes. The sea-level index points obtained plot in good accordance with the microfauna-based RSL positions previously obtained in the region. Some diagenetic losses in TN are observed between modern and Holocene sediments. This does not appear to be harmful to the accuracy of the RSL reconstructions but suggests that C/N ratios may be unreliable palaeoenvironmental proxies in this specific context.

AB  - Wetlands provide many important services throughout the world, with an estimated economic value that, in comparison to other ecosystems, far exceeds their relatively small global extent. In recognition of their importance, both national and international regulations exist to protect the world's remaining wetlands. Of growing interest is the "no-net-loss'' policy which permits unavoidable destruction of wetlands if compensated by restoration of degraded wetlands or creation of new wetlands. The fundamental assumption of no-net-loss is that wetlands can be created which function equivalently to natural wetlands. One integral function that wetlands perform is cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Here we demonstrate that loss of this nutrient-related function is not being mitigated by creation or restoration of wetlands. We compare indicators of plant-and microbial-mediated functions, as well as abiotic (e. g., soil character, hydrology) and biotic (e. g., plant community composition) structure, between 10 created or restored and 5 natural freshwater depressional wetlands in central Ohio, USA. Nutrient stocks were generally smaller and transformations slower in created wetlands than in natural wetlands, with little development over time. Of particular concern were differences in C-and N-related function. Created wetlands stored 90% less C within litter and 80% less C within soil and processed 60% less N through denitrification, on average compared to natural wetlands. Our study suggests that subversion of natural wetlands into restored or created wetlands could have large-scale environmental consequences such as reduced capacity for nitrate removal and C sequestration.

AB  - Estuaries are a major boundary in the land-ocean interaction zone where organic carbon (OC) and nutrients are being processed, resulting in a high water-to-air carbon dioxide (CO2) flux (similar to 0.25 Pg C y(-1)). The continental shelves, however, take up CO2 (similar to 0.25 Pg C y(-1)) from the atmosphere, accounting for approximately 17% of open ocean CO2 uptake (1.5 Pg C y(-1)). It is demonstrated here that CO2 release in estuaries is largely supported by microbial decomposition of highly productive intertidal marsh biomass. It appears that riverine OC, however, would bypass the estuarine zone, because of short river-transit times, and contribute to carbon cycling in the ocean margins and interiors. Low-latitude ocean margins release CO2 because they receive two-thirds of the terrestrial OC. Because of recent CO2 increase in the atmosphere, CO2 releases from low latitudes have become weaker and CO2 uptake by mid- and high-latitude shelves has become stronger, thus leading to more dissolved inorganic carbon export to the ocean.

AB  - Tidal flats play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. Intertidal environments are very dynamic and have several erosive landforms such as tidal depressions (TD), although TD genesis is still poorly understood. The tidal flats of the Bahia Blanca Estuary (BBE) are ideal for TD's study since they are hardly altered by human activity. In this site is possible to distinguish a gradation from a non-bioturbed zone to one dominated by erosive landforms. This preliminary study aims to determine the origin and evolution of TD in tidal flats and evaluate their role as carbon sinks based on an integrated sedimentological and geomorphological study. We found that the origin of TD in siliciclastic tidal flat is associated with the activity of the Neohelice granulata crabs. N. granulata selects finer particles and organic matter to build burrows; also alter the physical properties of the sediment. The loss of sediment structure by the increase in the density of excavations added to the tidal dynamics favour the burrows's collapse giving rise to the tidal depression. Tidal dynamics affect sediment stability by exerting a hydrostatic pressure on the burrow when flooding and emptying of burrows. The effect of N. granulata in the sediment record is clearly identifies by an increase water content with a decrease in the sediment density. Furthermore, it is possible to identify changes in the grain size distribution curves of the typical tidal flat facies as a second mode at 10 mu m. These features can be recognised and used as a tool to identify TD in the geological record. TD with occluded crab burrows can be important organic carbon sinks due to the organic matter fixation under suitable conditions that delay its decomposition. Due to the large number of TD (of the order of 35 million), we estimated that the C sequestration by these landforms might be of the order 1.8 x 10(-3) Gtn without considering that may be stored directly on the tidal flats themselves.

AB  - This study considers the spatial variability of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storage in a drained alpine wetland and the possible relationships with soil properties. Top 0-0.30 m soil samples were collected in a typical alpine wetland in the south-eastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau using grid sampling. There was high spatial variability for soil organic carbon density (SOCD), soil total nitrogen density (STND), and soil total phosphorous density (STPD) in the drained alpine wetland. Spherical models best described the structure of the semivariograms for SOCD and STPD, and an exponential model for STND, with the range parameter of <4 m. Similar spatial distribution with lower or higher patches of C, N, and P storage were observed. SOCD, STND, and STPD were significantly negatively correlated with soil moisture (P<0.01), and significantly positively correlated with bulk density (P<0.01). However, no significant correlations were observed between SOCD, STND, and STPD and soil pH values. Wetland drainage might lead to higher C, N, and P densities in top 0.30 m soils due to peat compaction; thus, it is necessary to incorporate water table fluctuations or the whole depth of peat layers to estimating precisely C, N and P storage.

AB  - Marshes are considered exporters of organic material, with tides being one of the most studied transport mechanisms. However, animal movements can enhance this energy transport and even, in some cases, import energy to marshes by fecal deposition. In this work, we analyze if Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata, an abundant intertidal burrowing crab that changes its diet between marsh (herbivorous) and tidal flat (deposit feeder) zones and moves between zones during the tidal cycle, enhance energy transfer between marshes and tidal flats by fecal deposition. Given that higher tidal levels increase these movements, two intertidal habitats with different tidal amplitudes were compared (Mar Chiquita Coastal lagoon 37 degrees 40' S -MCCL, max 2 m and San Antonio Bay 40 degrees 46' S -SAB, max 9 m). The seasonal and tidal movements between zones were studied using movement traps. Crabs moving towards each direction were kept in containers to calculate fecal production and the total organic matter (OM) release and OM% of their feces. With these data, a resampling technique was performed to compare with a 3 way ANOVA the net transport of feces seasonally, between zones, in both intertidals. The results showed that the movement of N. granulata enhances the exchange of OM among habitats by fecal deposition between marsh and tidal flats with seasonal variations in its importance. Fecal transport showed differences between locations being 10 times higher in winter and decreasing towards summer in MCCL, while the opposite trend was found in SAB. There were no differences in the OM deposited in each zone in SAB but in MCCL there was 45% more feces deposited in the marsh than in the tidal flat. The fecal OM% is higher in SAB than in MCCL suggesting that biodeposition in SAB, where it can reach 40%OM (surrounding sediment is lower than 2%) could be more important. The fecal production in MCCL is about 80% of the rate of detritus production in the marsh. In conclusion, fecal deposition is a very important input of energy in marsh zones, being crabs an important mechanism in transporting OM mainly towards the marsh zones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes in the sources and sinks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in wetland soils as indicators of soil quality and climate change have received attention worldwide. Soil samples were collected in 2007 and 2012 in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta and the SOC and TN were determined to investigate a five-year change in their content and stock in these wetlands as affected by flow-sediment regulation. Our results revealed that the soils in 2007 exhibited greater electrical conductivities, SOC content and density, and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) levels in the top 10 cm soils (p < 0.05) compared with the soils in 2012. In general, the SOC and TN contents decreased with increasing soil depth. However, the highest ratios of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (molar C/N ratios) were observed in the 30-40 cm soil layer. A significant SOC loss occurred (p < 0.05) in top 10 cm soils, but only a small change in SOC in the top 50 cm soils. Comparatively, TN levels did not show significant differences in the study period.

AB  - The sediment of Venice Lagoon regularly undergoes complex redistribution due to tidal forcing, which affects the cycling of contaminants such as mercury (Hg) between the sediment and the water column. We examined the distribution of total Hg (THg) and monomethylmercury (MMHg) in the water column, sediment and pore-water at two sites: VE1 (located in a depositional area adjacent to salt marshes) and VE2 corresponding to a moderately erosive, open area. We obtained instantaneous (using cores and micro-needle samplers) and time-integrated (using peepers) concentrations of the two mercury species in both dissolved and particulate forms. THg and MMHg concentrations were higher in the sediments at site VE1 (621.9 +/- 213.7 ng g(-1) and 1.25 +/- 0.63 ng g(-1) for THg and MMHg, respectively) than in those of the site VE2 (386.9 +/- 92.7 ng g(-1) and 0.53 +/- 0.30 ng g(-1)). Hg concentrations in sediments were positively correlated with silts and organic matter content. Over two tidal cycles, the concentrations of THg and MMHg varied with the evolution of the tides. During the tidal flooding, both THg and MMHg peaked at the sediment-water interface and a moderate increase of dissolved MMHg was also observed in the water column. These fluctuations were observed during both tides and are suggestively related to advection of mercury species from surficial sediment pore-water to the water column and to desorption from suspended particles. The short-term increase in MMHg concentrations can result from in situ production, release from organic matter degradation, or from oxidative dissolution of redox-sensitive sulfide minerals and iron oxide reduction by micro-organisms: the two latter mechanisms being favored by redox oscillations in the surface sediment layers due to the tidal forcing. The decrease of both dissolved THg and MMHg concentrations at the sediment-water interface after high tide was attributed to a rapid adsorption onto particles. THg concentrations on suspended particles showed little variations during the tidal cycle with a minor peak at tide maximum, while MMHg concentrations on suspended particles slightly increased during ebb tide. MMHg concentrations on suspended particles were double than those in surface sediments, suggesting that tidal flushing may enhance dispersal of particle bound MMHg throughout the lagoon.

AB  - Carbon dynamics in vegetated ecosystems are influenced by plants, belowground bacteria, and their interactions. Consequently, quantifying the fate of new plant production, identifying bacterial carbon sources, and evaluating plant-microbe interactions can provide insight to carbon cycling and storage. To follow short-term carbon transformations in a Spartina alterniflora-soil system, we applied C-13-labeled CO2 to aboveground leaves and chased it belowground into roots and bacterial lipids. Plant mesocosms were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 for 0, 1, 3, or 6 h. Incorporation of (CO2)-C-13 by plants and soil microbes was measured immediately after the incubation (Day 0) and 24 h later (Day 1). During a 24 h period, 41-64 % of the (CO2)-C-13 fixed by S. alterniflora was retained in leaves, 2.7-6.4 % was transferred to roots, and 30-55 % was lost via respiration. Small fractions of C-13 assimilated by aboveground leaves were detected belowground in bacterial lipids on Day 1. Enrichment of lipids specific to sulfate reducing bacteria (10-methyl C-16:0, cy-C-17:0) indicated tight coupling between aboveground plant production and belowground anaerobic metabolisms. Overall, we found that a substantial fraction of new production was returned to the atmosphere within 24 h and that belowground bacteria were tightly coupled to plant dynamics.

AB  - The distribution pattern and diversity of Collembola communities in the soils of low and high intertidal saltmarshes were compared. The intertidal "mud" soils are colonized by Collembola to depth of 30 cm and at a distance of 10 m towards the sea from coastal edge. The communities of Collembola in low intertidal saltmarsh soils are dominated by a population of Archisotoma sp. The contents of organic matter in the intertidal saltmarsh soils influenced the distribution of Archisotoma sp.

AB  - Mangroves play an important role in enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient pools. The exotic Sonneratia apetala is widely used for the restoration of mangroves in China because of its fast growth. However, it is not clear whether S. apetala increases SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools compared with the native mangrove species. Thus, the aims of this study were to determine whether Kandelia obovata and the fast-growing mangrove species S. apetala have advantages with regard to the SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools and whether restored mangroves have SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus content and pools similar to those of original mangroves. Four sites in the Qi'aoDangan Provincial Nature Reserve were selected: a 15-year-old planted S. apetala forest, a 15-year-old planted K. obovata forest, a native K. obovata forest, and an unvegetated mudflat. The content and pools of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the soil were compared. Compared with mudflats, the content and pools of SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus were significantly increased by planting S. apetala. However, compared with the 15-year-old planted K. obovata, the fast-growing S. apetala showed no advantage. The content and pools of SOC and nitrogen in the 15-year-old planted S. apetala site were lower than those of native K. obovata forests. It is recommended that more native mangrove species be used for future mangrove restoration to increase the content and pools of SOC, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora is an invasive C-4 perennial grass, native to North America, and has spread rapidly along the east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C-3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40cm deep soils. The delta C-13 decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in delta C-13 among layers of the top 60cm soil was significant (p < 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (> 60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in delta C-13 with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species.

AB  - Wetland impoundments are created to provide ecological benefits such as water quality improvement, mosquito control, and migratory bird habitat. Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, located on the southwestern shore of the Delaware Bay, is composed of four interconnected wetland management units. Tidal inflow from Delaware Bay to Units I and IV occurs naturally, whereas flow to Units II and III has been restricted by tidal gates since the mid-1980s. To assess the accretionary status of Refuge marshes and inform an ongoing restoration, we investigated soil physical properties and developed Cs-137 and Pb-210 radiochronologies for cores collected at twelve sites. Results indicate that marsh accretion is driven by a combination of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation, the relative proportions of which vary among and within the wetland units. Accretion rates (0.11-0.54 cm/y) were found to be significantly correlated with organic matter accumulation but not with mineral sediment accumulation. These relationships demonstrate that biotic contributions to marsh accretion, such as belowground biomass productivity, must be considered in marsh restoration strategies, in addition to the supply of mineral sediment. At eight of the sites, the contribution of mineral sediment to the total volume of the soils has decreased significantly since the early 1900s, predating the impoundment works, perhaps in association with closure of two tidal inlets by natural processes. By comparison, changes in organic soil volume were relatively small over the same time span. At seven of the sites the marsh is accreting at, to just below, the rate of local relative sea-level rise (0.34 +/- 0.03 cm/y) with potential for submergence on the long term. Additional research at the Refuge is needed to better align measurements of marsh accretion, relative sea-level from tide gauges, and wetland elevation change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Based on measurements of the concentrations of C, N, P, and chlorophyll-a, as well as on palynological analysis of the core Vdr 2011 of peaty sediments from the Vydrinaya River along the southern coast of Lake Baikal, the geochemical characteristics of eutrophy were compared to pollen indices of changes in the environment and the mode of marsh ecosystem transformations into various trophic states was specified. It was shown that geochemical parameters of the changes in the environment may be considered as the characteristics of trophic conditions in ecosystems in the course of paleo-reconstructions.

AB  - In order to characterize the organic and isotopic compositions and the origin of the sediment deposited in the Amazon river floodplain, samples from lake bottom, grass cover, and vegetation free sediments were studied. The results obtained showed that after deposition the organic characteristics of these sediments were altered according to their environment. Thus, compared to river-transported fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), samples from the lake bottom sediments showed increases in carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and decreases in delta-C-13 values due to the low isotopic composition of the particulate organic carbon in the lakes. Samples from areas covered by grasses had lower nitrogen and carbon relative to FPOM. The isotopic composition was changed by organic matter produced by the grasses, becoming less negative in delta-C-13 in the downriver direction. In the vegetation-free samples, collected over areas that had been recently drained, the isotopic composition did not change in relation to FPOM, but a decrease in carbon and nitrogen was observed.

AB  - Estuaries of the southeastern United States not only serve an important nursery function but also are common repositories of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from upland activities. Thus, these habitats may be at risk for PAH phototoxicity. To better characterize this risk, a daily survey of ultraviolet-A (UV-A; 320-400 nm) irradiance was performed at Leadenwah Creek (Wadmalaw Island, SC, USA) on June 27 and August 1, 2003. In addition, laboratory assays were completed using two light exposure regimes: One that was typical of historical phototoxicity assessments (continuous light [C-UV]), and a more environmentally realistic regime (ER-UV). On both survey days, irradiance at a depth of 10 cm exhibited a pattern generally similar to that observed at the surface, whereas irradiance at the bottom of the creek was a function of both tidal height and time of day. Total UV-A dose at a 10-cm depth on June 27 and August 1, 2003 was 4.37 and 4.78 J/cm(2), respectively. Attenuation coefficients on both days varied as a function of tidal height. In the laboratory, larval grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) exposed to an ER-UV regime for these habitats (photoperiod, 12:12-h light:dark; total daily UV-A dose, 4.40 J/cm(2)) exhibited a 2.5-fold decrease in toxicity compared with those exposed to the C-UV regime (photoperiod, 24:0-h light:dark; total daily UV dose, 1.50 J/cm(2)), despite a threefold higher UV dose in the ER-UV regime. The lower potency under the ER-UV regime likely is attributable to the presence of a 12-h dark period allowing for recovery. The consequences of these results are discussed in the context of habitat-specific UV-A dose and its relevance to future laboratory assessments of PAH phototoxicity.

AB  - The Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta in western Alaska is the principal nesting area for several species of geese, including Pacific black brant. Grazing by geese on Carex ramenskii, one of the most abundant plant species throughout much of this region, appears to have increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was (i) to evaluate the effects of early-season defoliation and fertilization on plant growth and nutrient cycling processes within field plots of C. ramenskii over a 3-year period, and (ii) to study the interactive effects of defoliation, N availability, and salinity stress on growth, and biomass and N allocation in C. ramenskii under controlled, greenhouse conditions. Relative to control plots, clipped-fertilized plots showed significant increases in aboveground net primary production (AGNPP) and leaf N concentration, resulting in significant increases in offtake biomass and offtake N during both 1991 and 1992. In the greenhouse, total production of clipped and unclipped plants did not differ, but clipped plants had significantly higher offtake biomass, and biomass and N allocation to offtake compared to unclipped plants. Both field and laboratory experiments found that rapid regrowth following defoliation was dependent on soil nutrient availability. Fertilization increased soil respiration rates each year, but tended to decrease rates of net N mineralization, indicating that the soil microbial biomass is a strong nutrient sink in this ecosystem. In addition to the direct positive effects that goose feces have on plant growth, nitrogen recycled through feces may be an important source of nitrogen contributing to salinity tolerance in C. ramenskii. Our results also suggest that the observed increase in grazing pressure on patches of C. ramenskii early in the growing season may increase forage quality and quantity within these swards, and have important implications for geese-ecosystem interactions at a time of rapid goose population increase.

AB  - Boreal wetlands are significant natural sources of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, and are vulnerable to freezing-thawing cycles (FTC). Nonetheless, the underlying factors that induce CH4 emission in boreal wetlands during FTC are still unclear. Our goal was to characterize soil CH4 emission potential from a freshwater marsh as impacted by FTC and to determine the corresponding mechanisms. We collected soil samples from two soil layers (0-20 and 2040 cm) of an undisturbed freshwater marsh in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, and subjected them to various freezing (6 to -6 degrees C) and thawing (-6 to 6 degrees C) cycles. Soil CH4 emission, DOC, and the aromaticity and complexity of DOC indexes were monitored. The results showed that FTC significantly increased CH4 emission potential in the 0-20 cm surface soil layer. The maximum hourly CH4 emission rate was 55.0 mg C m(-2) h(-1), approximately 19 times as high as that of the unfrozen control sample (2.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). However, the peak intensity of CH4 emission decreased when the numbers of FTC increased. Meanwhile, FTC not only increased the quantity of DOC released, but also enhanced its instability via increasing the contribution of relatively small, readily degradable organic molecules. Additionally, the CH4 emission potential was significantly correlated with the aromaticity and complexity of DOC, indicating that the release of labile substrates under FTC was one important factor controlling the microbial production of CH4 and the high emissions upon thawing. Our study suggested that global warming-induced increases in seasonal FTC in boreal wetlands may increase CH4 emissions beyond what would occur from long-term temperature increases alone.

AB  - The increasing success of invasive plant species in wetland areas can threaten their capacity to store carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C, N, and P). Here, we have investigated the relationships between the different stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and total C, N, and P pools in the plant-soil system from eight different wetland areas across the South-East coast of China, where the invasive tallgrass Spartina alterniflora has replaced the native tall grasses Phragmites australis and the mangrove communities, originally dominated by the native species Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina. The invasive success of Spartina alterniflora replacing Phragmites australis did not greatly influence soil traits, biomass accumulation or plant-soil C and N storing capacity. However, the resulting higher ability to store P in both soil and standing plant biomass (approximately more than 70 and 15 kg P by ha, respectively) in the invasive than in the native tall grass communities suggesting the possibility of a decrease in the ecosystem N:P ratio with future consequences to below- and aboveground trophic chains. The results also showed that a future advance in the native mangrove replacement by Spartina alterniflora could constitute a serious environmental problem. This includes enrichment of sand in the soil, with the consequent loss of nutrient retention capacity, as well as a sharp decrease in the stocks of C (2.6 and 2.2 t C ha(-1) in soil and stand biomass, respectively), N, and P in the plant-soil system. This should be associated with a worsening of the water quality by aggravating potential eutrophication processes. Moreover, the loss of carbon and nutrient decreases the potential overall fertility of the system, strongly hampering the reestablishment of woody mangrove communities in the future.

AB  - In order to examine the role of position in the tidal range on biomass production and nutrient pools in Spartina alterniflora in an Argentinian estuary, we estimated productivity, the concentration of C, N and P in tissues and pools (concentration x biomass) of these elements in low (LM) and high (HM) zones. Aboveground biomass of S. alterniflora was higher in HM than in LM. Aboveground primary productivity was 106 and 439 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1) in LM and HM, respectively. Belowground biomass was similar in LM and HM. Belowground primary productivity was 526 and 744 g dry wtm(-2) year(-1) for LM and HM, respectively. Nutrient pools were higher in HM than in LM. Biomass and productivity values were low, which makes nutrient pools low. The lower values of the parameters analysed in LM than in HM indicate that position in the tidal range is an important factor in this system, possibly due to the effect of flooding. Moreover, this pattern is opposite to the general one observed in the northern hemisphere, meaning that studying marshes from different environments is worth doing. Because pools were higher in HM, this zone would be more important for nutrient input to the estuary.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the major sources of organic matter for macroconsumers in the Ria Formosa tidal lagoon. The C, S and N isotopic natural abundances of abundant primary producers of particulate organic matter (POM) and Mytilus galloprovincialis muscle and digestive,oland were analysed. The chlorophyll a (Chl a), the suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the POM were measured along the Faro-Olhao channel. The range of variation of stable isotope values among primary producers in Ria Formosa was low suggesting difficulties in the assessment of their relative contribution to higher levels of the food web. Chl a Values decreased from outer station to inner station, while SPM and POM values increased. The multiple isotope approach illustrates that POM values along the Faro-Olhao channel, may result from a mixture of upland plants, benthic plants and phytoplankton. Mussel values indicate a selective diet of benthic macrophytes and phytoplankton, with the relative proportions of each determined by the location in the channel. During winters, the upland plants may be an important source of organic matter in the inner lagoon while phytoplankton was an important source of organic matter in the outer lagoon.

AB  - We investigated the relative roles of competition and environmental stressors in two wetland plants important for coastal restoration in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Phragmites australis and Schoenoplectus deltarum are ubiquitous in tidal freshwater marshes along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast. Schoenoplectus delta urn and Phragmites australis were grown in both monoculture and competition, and subjected to two levels each of nitrogen, salinity, and soil organic matter in a factorial greenhouse experiment, Productivity in both species was consistently suppressed under competition; the extent of this depended on the abiotic treatments. In monoculture, Schoenoplectus productivity responded negatively to low organic matter and reproduction responded negatively to brackish water; Phragmites productivity responded negatively to increased nitrogen. Schoenoplectus root-to-shoot ratio responded positively to brackish water when grown in soil with high organic matter, and Phragmites root-to-shoot ratio responded negatively to increased nitrogen. The sediment diversion operation strategy that has been recommended by experts familiar with Louisiana coastal wetland restoration may result in marshes characterized by increased nitrogen, periodic brackish water conditions, and increased soil organic matter. Such a strategy may therefore promote species coexistence and increased root production, which are respectively associated with increased ecosystem services and soil stability. The differential responses of the two species to the same conditions illustrates the importance of considering individual species to a restoration project.

AB  - Broad-scale estimates of belowground biomass are needed to understand wetland resiliency and C and N cycling, but these estimates are difficult to obtain because root:shoot ratios vary considerably both within and between species. We used remotely-sensed estimates of two aboveground plant characteristics, aboveground biomass and % foliar N to explore biomass allocation in low diversity freshwater impounded peatlands (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, CA, USA). We developed a hybrid modeling approach to relate remotely-sensed estimates of % foliar N (a surrogate for environmental N and plant available nutrients) and aboveground biomass to field-measured belowground biomass for species specific and mixed species models. We estimated up to 90% of variation in foliar N concentration using partial least squares (PLS) regression of full-spectrum field spectrometer reflectance data. Landsat 7 reflectance data explained up to 70% of % foliar N and 67% of aboveground biomass. Spectrally estimated foliar N or aboveground biomass had negative relationships with belowground biomass and root:shoot ratio in both Schoenoplectus acutus and Typha, consistent with a balanced growth model, which suggests plants only allocate growth belowground when additional nutrients are necessary to support shoot development. Hybrid models explained up to 76% of variation in belowground biomass and 86% of variation in root:shoot ratio. Our modeling approach provides a method for developing maps of spatial variation in wetland belowground biomass.

AB  - Sedimentary material from coastal and nearshore areas in the Mississippi Delta region are comprised of different organic carbon sources with diverse ages that require isotopic and elemental records for resolving the various sources of plant residues. Carbon isotopic (C-13, C-14) values were used to differentiate contributions from plants using the C3, C4, and/or CAM (crassulaccan acid metabolism) carbon fixation pathways., and iodine concentrations indicated that wetland plant residues are a significant source of organic carbon in a sediment core from the Mississippi River delta region collected at a 60 m water depth. This sediment core had been extensively described in Oktay et al. [Oktay, S.D., Santschi, P.H., Moran, J.E., Sharma, P., 2000. The 129 Iodine Bomb Pulse Recorded in Mississippi River delta Sediments: Results from Isotopes of 1, Pu, Cs, Pb, and C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 64 (6), 989-996.] and significantly, includes unique features that had not previously been seen in the marine environment. These special features include a plutonium isotopic close-in fallout record that indicates a purely terrestrial source for these sediment particles and the elements associated with it, and a distinct iodine isotopic peak (as well as peaks for plutonium and cesium isotopes) that indicate little bioturbation in this core. Our carbon isotopic and iodine data can thus be compared to published records of changes in drainage basin land use, river hydrology, and hydrodynamic sorting of suspended particles to elucidate if these changes are reflected in nearshore sediments. This comparison suggests a significant contribution for organic carbon (OC) from C4 plants to these sediments during the 1950's to early 1960's. Relative older carbon isotopes, and episodically high iodine concentrations (up to 34 ppm) were observed during this time period that (1) indicate sediment deposition that is coincident with the times of major hydrological changes induced from dam and levee building in both the upper and lower reaches of the Mississippi River drainage basin, and (2) suggest episodic organic carbon deposition from wetland plant residues.

AB  - The ecological consequences of exotic plant invasion have focused largely on interactions with native plants or animals, whereas ecosystem level consequences, such as organic matter accumulation, soil nitrogen (N) transformations, hydrological fluctuation and changes in surface water chemistry remain largely unknown. We studied the invasion of exotic emergent plant purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in a freshwater wetland dominated by cattail (Typha latifolia). Transects were set in Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, NY that originated in a pure Typha area, crossed over mixed zone, and extended into a pure Lythrum area. Comparing monotypic plots, there was significantly more standing-dead biomass of Lythrum than Typha (1.88 kg m(-2) versus 0.59 kg m-2); while collapsed dead Typha shoots formed a layer of litter which was absent in the Lythrum area. Soil organic matter content was significantly higher in Lythrum sediment than in Typha sediment (35.2 kg m(-2) versus 27.5 kg m(-2), down to 20 cm deep). Average monthly N mineralization rates were significantly higher in the Lythrum plots than in Typha plots (911 mg N m(-2) versus 638 mg N m(-2)). N transformations were also controlled by local hydrology. Net N mineralization rates were more than doubled when water table dropped to expose the sediment to the atmosphere, and ammonium production was changed to nitrate production. Surface water NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-) concentrations remained low in all sites, suggesting strong plant uptake by both species. In a concurrent greenhouse study, we found Lythrum plants transpired about twice the amount of water as Typha, and had above- and below-ground biomass that more than doubled that of Typha. The combined field and greenhouse studies suggest that Lythrum invasion may cause changes in organic matter distribution, N cycling and water chemistry in freshwater wetlands. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of two coastal Louisiana marsh management plans on water and materials flux, shortterm sedimentation, and several soil parameters was evaluated between May 1989 and January 1990. The study was carried out in the Fina-Laterre Marsh Management Area and the Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in managed and unmanaged areas. Water and material flux was measured each two hours during twelve 48 h flux studies, and net fluxes per m(2) of drainage area were calculated for water, total suspended sediments, salinity, NO3+NO2, PO4, and NH4. Short-term sedimentation was measured as the weight of material deposited over 2-4 week intervals on petri dishes placed on the marsh surface. The managed sites experienced considerable reductions in total water exchange, leading to reductions in net material exchanges. when expressed on a per m(2) basis, the managed wetlands are much less tightly coupled to the surrounding estuary compared to unmanaged areas. Within the context of a general decrease of exchange, the two managed areas on average export materials to the estuary. In the managed areas, the results suggest that management can lead to reduced salinity and a loss of sediments and nutrients. Short-term sedimentation was less at the managed areas; expressed as g m(-2)d(-1), total sedimentation rates were 0.57 for Fina managed, 1.02 for Fina unmanaged, 1.68 for Rockefeller managed, and 3.82 for Rockefeller unmanaged. Soil P was lower and soil organic matter was higher at the managed areas. Organic matter in the soil was low compared with recently deposited material, suggesting that most organic matter deposited on the surface of the marsh is lost through decomposition. Reduction of flooding during storm events is the likely mechanism leading to reduced sedimentation on the marsh surface in the managed areas.

AB  - The Sanjiang Plain, the second largest marsh in China, has experienced intensive cultivation over the past 50 years. Most of the marshlands were converted to soybean and rice fields. However, little is known about the effects of tillage on the soil fauna. 9 treatments, including original marshland soil, rice and soybean cultivation with and without fertilizer and herbicide applications, were imitated with 135 buckets under greenhouse conditions. The soil characteristics and Collembola in these treatments were investigated for one plant growth season.
   The soil environment was deteriorated (as indicated by the decreased soil oxidizable organic matter, total nitrogen and soil water content and increased soil compaction) by soybean and rice cultivation treatments. The densities and species richness of Collembola significantly decreased in the rice cultivation treatments but not in the soybean cultivation treatments. For the soybean cultivation treatments, density and species richness of the soil Collembola significantly increased in the fertilizer, herbicide and fertilizer + herbicide application treatments. It probably caused by increasing root and shoot biomass in these treatments.
   It is concluded that the tillage treatments in a wetland soil had both qualitative and quantitative adverse effects on the soil collembolans, and these effects might further alter the soil ecological processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A HPLC protocol is described which permits analysis of the pigment composition of coastal and intertidal sediments. The HPLC technique has been extensively applied to phytoplankton pigments for fifteen years. Papers dealing with living benthic microphytic populations have been more rare, due to complexity existing in the sediment surface, where pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) from several taxonomic groups of microalgae are mixed with degraded pigments from senescent phytoplankton cells and macrophytic material. The present paper describes in detail a protocol adapted from Kraay et al. (1992), which allows a good discrimination of photosynthetic pigments of microphytobenthos communities.
   The following procedure is recommended. Sediment samples are collected using hand-held cores, during emersion of sites in intertidal zones or by scuba-diving in submerged zones. Cores are sectioned in slices of 5 mm, weighed and lyophilized. Subsamples of 0.3-3 g are extracted in 95 % methanol buffered with ammonium acetate, during 10-20 min in the dark, at 5 degrees C; the extract is then filtered with the Sweenex system with GF/F Whatman filters.
   Fluorescence excitation is performed at 430 nm and emission is detected beyond 580 nm. Absorbance is detected simultaneously at 436 and 450 nm. A binary solvent system is employed to separate the pigments. Standards for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and beta-carotene were obtained from Sigma; chlorophyllide a was prepared from thallus of the Phaeophyta Halopteris; pheophytins a and b and a major pheophorbide a were prepared by acidification (HCl 0.4 N, final molarity 3 10(-3) M); chlorophylls c(1) + c(2) and several carotenoids were also obtained from Halopteris. The remaining carotenoids were identified by comparison with published chromatograms. Calibration of standards was done spectrophotometrically in acetone or other solvents, subject to the existence of published extinction coefficients. Pigments were dried and redissolved in methanol in order to calculate the HPLC factor. A table of the coefficients used is given.
   Five chromatograms of three different intertidal stations from the Tagus estuary are presented as examples; 29 pigments were identified. Chromatograms obtained in fluorescence and absorbance at 436 nm and 450 nm from the same sample are shown to permit comparison between performances of the different types of detection. All chlorophylls, active or degraded, are distinguished in fluorescence. Some of them appear clearly in absorbance at 436 nm, while 450 nm is the best wavelength for identifying carotenoids.
   Pigment composition of sediment samples is related to microscopic species identification and cell abundance. Chromatograms obtained with absorbance at 450 nm from a mud sample in a salt-marsh showed high levels of violaxanthin, lutein (due to the abundance of plant detritus), zeaxanthin (corresponding to a population of 20 % cyanobacteria), and neoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and chlorophyll b (matching the abundance of euglenophytes: 10 %). A sample from a sandy station presented high levels of chlorophylls c(1) and c(2), neofucoxanthin and diatoxanthin; cell countings confirmed a major abundance of diatoms (99 %) with a dominance of Cylindrotheca closterium. A mud sample from a low-tide station exhibited a great variety of pheophorbides, which is related to the high grazing pressure at this site.
   Although no method exists that is perfect for all types of pigments, the one described showed a good capability for analysing the taxonomic composition of microphytobenthos communities.

AB  - The long-term burial of organic carbon in sediments results in the net accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, thereby mediating the redox state of the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere. Sediment microbial activity plays a major role in determining whether particulate organic carbon is recycled or buried. A diverse consortium of microorganisms that hydrolyze, ferment, and terminally oxidize organic compounds mediates anaerobic organic matter mineralization in anoxic sediments. Variable temperature regulation of the sequential processes, leading from the breakdown of complex particulate organic carbon to the production and subsequent consumption of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved intermediates, could play a key role in controlling rates of overall organic carbon mineralization. We examined sediment organic carbon cycling in a sediment slurry and in flow through bioreactor experiments. The data show a variable temperature response of the microbial functional groups mediating organic matter mineralization in anoxic marine sediments, resulting in the temperature-driven decoupling of the production and consumption of organic intermediates. This temperature-cl riven decoupling leads to the accumulation of labile, low-molecular weight, dissolved organic carbon at low temperatures and low-molecular weight dissolved organic carbon limitation of terminal metabolism at higher temperatures.

AB  - We investigated spatial and temporal changes in spectral irradiance, phytoplankton community composition, and primary productivity in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA. High concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were responsible for up to 84 % of the attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). Green-yellow wavelengths were the predominant colors of light available at the two sampling sites: Clam Bank Creek and Oyster Landing. Vertical attenuation coefficients of PAR were 0.7-2.1 m(-1) with corresponding euphotic zone depths of 1.5-6.7 m. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a [chl a]) varied seasonally with a summer maximum of 16 mu g chl a l(-1) and a winter minimum of 1.4 mu g chl a l(-1). The phytoplankton community consisted mainly of diatoms, prasinophytes, cryptophytes and haptophytes, with diatoms and prasinophytes accounting for up to 67 % of total chl a. Changes in phytoplankton community composition showed strongest correlations with temperature. Light-saturated chl a-specific rates of photosynthesis and daily primary productivity varied with season and ranged from 1.6 to 14 mg C (mg chl a) (-1) h(-1) (32-803 mg C m(-3) day(-1)). Calculated daily rates added up to an annual carbon fixation rate of 84 g C m(-3) year(-1). Overall, changes in phytoplankton community composition and primary productivity in North Inlet showed a strong dependence on temperature, with PAR and spectral irradiance playing a relatively minor role due to short residence times, strong tidal forcing and vertical mixing.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are an ecological engineering technology that has been widely applied to treat anthropogenic wastewater. Until now, few studies have focused on soil carbon (C) in the constructed treatment wetlands in tropical regions. Therefore, this study provides insight into the changes in soil C composition of tropically constructed wetlands at different ages. Five constructed wetlands were investigated in northern Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Soil C was analyzed at three different depths using an acid-hydrolysable method. The results showed that soil TOC content was highest on the soil surface (0-2 cm) and decreased at greater soil depths (2-5 and 5-10 cm) in all the studied constructed wetlands. There was more soil acid-hydrolysable C in the older constructed wetlands than in the younger ones at all depths. On the contrary, the soil recalcitrant carbon (RP-C) did not vary much across the wetland soils. In addition, the RP-C to TOC ratios were higher in the younger than older constructed wetlands, implying that the soil bioavailable C sources for microbial growth increased with the wetland's age. As a result, the compositions of organotrophic microbes, such as methanogens (mcrA copies), appeared to increase with wetlands' ages (i.e., negatively correlated with RP-C/TOC), while the total microbial abundance (16S rDNA) and abundance of lithotrophic microbes, such as methanotrophs (pmoA copies), were not correlated with RP-C/TOC or AHPI-C/TOC ratios, based on the results of our canonical correspondence analysis. Furthermore, the constructed wetlands accumulated soil RP-C from 2.33 to 0.08 g C m(-2) day(-1) in the constructed wetlands 1 to 30 years old, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sedimentary characteristics and processes on an estuarine marsh island in the Yangtze Estuary (East China Sea) show that (1) the mean grain size of the surficial sediments varies between 0.003 and 0.16 mm, the finest sediment being more enriched in the marsh center particularly under calm weather conditions during the flood season, and the coarsest sediment being more enriched on the low seaward tidal flats particularly after storms; (2) the sediment organic carbon content is generally less than 1.4 wt%; (3) the annual vertical marsh accretion is in the range of 20 cm, with a maximum value of 40 cm in the middle of the marsh; and (4) the seasonal cycle in plant growth strongly influences sediment grain size and erosion-accretion events.

AB  - Six campaigns were performed in North Channel (CNOR), Barcas Channel (BC) and lower zones (EZ) of Tagus estuary to better understand methylmercury (MMHg) and mercury (Hg) transport and fate.
   Highest concentrations of particulate and dissolved MMHg were observed in CNOR in bottom waters and in the warmest months. The MMHg distribution coefficients between particulate and dissolved fractions were mainly influenced by particulate matter and dissolved organic carbon. The values were slightly higher in summer than in winter and in CNOR. Overall, results established that the tidal effect is a main driver on the transport and fate of Hg and MMHg from CNOR to outer areas, evidenced by the exportation of the Hg species from CNOR to the upstream station in high tide and to the downstream one in low tide. Therefore, CNOR may be considered a source of Hg and MMHg to the outer estuary.

AB  - Coastal wetlands sequester large amounts of carbon in their soils, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and acting as a carbon sink. In this paper, we estimate the economic value of carbon sequestered by wetlands in the Delaware Estuary. We estimate the value of the current stock of wetlands, the value of the historic loss of wetlands, and under a range of different scenarios the expected future loss. We use historical topographic maps and Land Cover inventories of the Delaware Estuary to measure the acreage of tidal wetlands in nine distinct time periods from 1778 to 2011. Using these data, we estimate an annual rate of wetland loss of 1.03 km(2). Coupling observed land cover change with exogenous factors including sea-level rise, population pressure, and channel dredging, we estimate changes in tidal wetland area under a range of futufe scenarios for our expected future economic loss estimates.

AB  - Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems which vary widely in loading of the contaminant methylmercury (MeHg), and in environmental factors which control MeHg exposure to the estuarine foodweb. Inputs of organic carbon and rates of primary production are important influences on MeHg loading and bioaccumulation, and are predicted to increase with changes in climate and land use pressures. To further understand these influences on MeHg levels in estuarine biota, we used a field study approach in sites across different temperature regions, and with varying organic carbon levels. In paired comparisons of sites with high vs. low organic carbon, fish had lower MeHg bioaccumulation factors (normalized to water concentrations) in high carbon sites, particularly subsites with large coastal wetlands and large variability in dissolved organic carbon levels in the water column. Across sites, MeHg level in the water column was strongly tied to dissolved organic carbon, and was the major driver of MeHg concentrations in fish and invertebrates. Higher primary productivity (chlorophyll-a) was associated with increased MeHg partitioning to suspended particulates, but not to the biota. These findings suggest that increased inputs of MeHg and loss of wetlands associated with climate change and anthropogenic land use pressure will increase MeHg concentrations in estuarine food webs.

AB  - The position of tidal wetlands at the land-sea interface makes them especially vulnerable to the effects of nutrient discharges and sea level rise (SLR). Experimental studies of coastal wetland nutrient additions report conflicting results among and within habitats, highlighting the importance of site-specific factors, and how spatial and temporal scaling modulates responses. This suite of influences as SIR accelerates creates a "Gordian Knot" that may compromise coastal habitat integrity. We present eight testable hypotheses here to loosen this knot by identifying critical modulators about nutrient form, soil type and porosity, physiochemical gradients, and eco-evolutionary responses that may control the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal wetland sustainability: (1) the delivery and form of the nutrient shapes the ecosystem response; (2) soil type mediates the effects of nutrient enrichment on marshes; (3) belowground responses cannot be solely explained by phenotypic responses: (4) shifting zones of redox and salinity gradients modulate nutrient enrichment impacts; (5) eco-evolutionary processes can drive responses to nutrient availability; (6) nutrient enrichment leads to multiple changed ecosystem states; (7) biogeography trumps a plant's plastic responses to nutrient enrichment; and, (8) nutrient-enhanced wetlands are more susceptible to additional (and anticipated) anthropogenic changes. They provide a framework to investigate and integrate the urgently needed research to understand how excess nutrients threaten the sustainability of coastal wetlands, and wetlands in general. While there is no single 'right way' to test these hypotheses, including a combination of complex and simple, highly-replicated experiments is essential. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Rates of accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) as well as soil accretion rates were determined in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) and Liaohe Delta (LHD) in northeastern China. Rates of carbon accumulation were dominated by PIC accumulation in the YRD and by POC accumulation in the LHD. Rates of POC accumulation at sites above mean sea level were similar in the two deltas, 141 +/- 17 g C m(-2) y(-1), but were much higher, 381 +/- 10 g C m(-2) y(-1), at sites in the LHD below mean sea level. High rates of PIC accumulation in the YRD, 916 +/- 133 g C m(-2) y(-1), reflect the very high concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in the Yellow River, which in turn reflects the erosion of carbonate-rich glacial dust and evaporates minerals in the Loess Plateau, the excess of evaporation over precipitation in the watershed, and the fact that much of the flow in the river is diverted to irrigate crops. In both river deltas, accumulation of PIC was positively correlated with accumulation of POC, although the sources of the PIC are allochthonous and the sources of the POC are primarily autochthonous. Rates of POC accumulation were closely correlated with the species of wetland plants in the deltas. Although the rates of PIC accumulation in the YRD are exceptional, anthropogenic effects, including climate change, are creating conditions that will likely enhance PIC accumulation in many other river deltas.

AB  - We used a combined field and modeling approach to estimate the potential for submergence for one rapidly deteriorating (Bayou Chitigue Marsh) and one apparently stable (Old Oyster Bayou Marsh) saltmarsh wetland in coastal Louisiana, given two eustatic sea level rise scenarios: the current rate (0.15 cm year(-1)); and the central value predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (48 cm. by the year 2100). We also used the model to determine what processes were most critical for maintaining and influencing salt marsh elevation including, mineral matter deposition, organic matter production, shallow subsidence (organic matter decomposition + primary sediment compaction), deep subsidence, and sediment pulsing events (e.g., hurricanes). Eight years of field measurements from feldspar marker horizons and surface elevation tables revealed that the rates of vertical accretion at the Bayou Chitigue Marsh were high (2.26 (0.09) cm yr(-1) (mean +/- SE)) because the marsh exists at the lower end of the tidal range. The rate of shallow subsidence was also high (2.04 (0.1) cm yr(-1)), resulting in little net elevation gain (0.22 (0.06) cm yr(-1)). In contrast, vertical accretion at the Old Oyster Bayou Marsh, which is 10 cm higher in elevation, was 0.48 (0.09) cm yr(-1). However, there was a net elevation gain of 0.36 (0.08) cm yr(-1) because there was no significant shallow subsidence. When these rates of elevation gain were compared to rates of relative sea level rise (deep subsidence plus eustatic sea level rise), both sites showed a net elevation deficit although the Bayou Chitigue site was subsiding at approximately twice the rate of the Old Oyster Bayou site (1.1 cm yr(-1) versus 0.49 cm yr(-1) respectively). These field data were used to modify, initialize, and calibrate a previously published wetland soil development model that simulates primary production and mineral matter deposition as feedback functions of elevation. Sensitivity analyses revealed that wetland elevation was most sensitive to changes in the rates of deep subsidence, a model forcing function that is difficult to measure in the field and for which estimates in the literature vary widely. The model also revealed that, given both the current rate of sea level rise and the central value estimate, surface elevation at both sites would fall below mean sea level over the next 100 years. Although these results were in agreement with the field study, they contradicted long term observations that the Old Oyster Bayou site has been in equilibrium with sea level for at least the past 50 years. Further simulations showed that the elevation at the Old Oyster Bayou site could keep pace with current rates of sea level rise if either a lower rate for deep subsidence was used as a forcing function, or if a periodic sediment pulsing function (e.g., from hurricanes) was programmed into the model.

AB  - Manipulations of the vegetation and hydrology of wetlands for mosquito control are common worldwide, but these modifications may affect vital ecosystem processes. To control mosquitoes in mangrove swamps in eastern Florida, managers have used rotational impoundment management (RIM) as an alternative to the worldwide practice of mosquito ditching. Levees surround RIM swamps, and water is pumped into the impoundment during the summer, a season when natural swamps have low water levels. In the New World, these mosquito-managed swamps resemble the mixed basin type of mangrove swamp (based on PCA analysis). An assessment was made of RIM, natural (control), and breached-RIM (restored) swamps in eastern Florida to compare their structural complexities, soil development, and resistance to invasion. Regarding structural complexity, dominant species composition differed between these swamps; the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle occurred at a higher relative density in RIM and breached-RIM swamps, and the black mangrove Avicennia germinans had a higher relative density in natural swamps. Tree density and canopy cover were higher and tree height lower in RIM swamps than in natural and breached-RIM swamps. Soil organic matter in RIM swamps was twice that in natural or breached-RIM swamps. RIM swamps had a lower resistance to invasion by the Brazilian pepper tree Schinus terebinthifolius, which is likely attributable to the lower porewater salinity in RIM swamps. These characteristics may reflect differences in important ecosystem processes (primary production, trophic structure, nutrient cycling, decomposition). Comparative assessments of managed wetlands are vital for land managers, so that they can make informed decisions compatible with conservation objectives.

AB  - In recent decades we have witnessed human-induced alterations to coastal watersheds that caused or aggravated eutrophication problems in estuarine systems. Although eutrophication is a natural process in the aging of lakes and estuaries, human activities are greatly accelerating this phenomenon by increasing the rate at which nutrients and organic substances enter aquatic ecosystems from their surrounding watersheds. Despite there is a fundamental understanding of the processes that cause eutrophication we still need to develop new methods and indicators and improve others to detect incipient eutrophication in ecosystems, providing information before major changes in species composition and abundance take place. The need of reliable indicators that correlate estuarine changes with human pressures over time (urban, industrial, and agriculture) is essential to understand their dynamics and to ensure effective management of these ecosystems. This chapter aims to evaluate the relative utility of rooted macrophytes and chemical variables in assessing eutrophication of two Portuguese estuaries subjected to different degrees of anthropogenic inputs owing to varied human activities and soil uses on their watersheds. We also document nitrogen deposition history in each estuary.

AB  - Living shorelines are a type of estuarine shoreline erosion control that incorporates native vegetation and preserves native habitats. Because they provide the ecosystem services associated with natural coastal wetlands while also increasing shoreline resilience, living shorelines are part of the natural and hybrid infrastructure approach to coastal resiliency. Marshes created as living shorelines are typically narrow (< 30 m) fringing marshes with sandy substrates that are well flushed by tides. These characteristics distinguish living shorelines from the larger meadow marshes in which most of the current knowledge about created marshes was developed. The value of living shorelines for providing both erosion control and habitat for estuarine organisms has been documented but their capacity for carbon sequestration has not. We measured carbon sequestration rates in living shorelines and sandy transplanted Spartina alterniflora marshes in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. The marshes sampled here range in age from 12 to 38 years and represent a continuum of soil development. Carbon sequestration rates ranged from 58 to 283 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and decreased with marsh age. The pattern of lower sequestration rates in older marshes is hypothesized to be the result of a relative enrichment of labile organic matter in younger sites and illustrates the importance of choosing mature marshes for determination of long-term carbon sequestration potential. The data presented here are within the range of published carbon sequestration rates for S. alterniflora marshes and suggest that wide-scale use of the living shoreline approach to shoreline management may come with a substantial carbon benefit.

AB  - To investigate the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on spatial and temporal variations of sulfur in marsh sediments, the levels of total sulfur (TS) and inorganic sulfur (IS) fractions (Water-Soluble-S, W-S-S; Adsorbed-S, A-S; HCl-Soluble-S, H-S-S; and HCl-Volatile-S, H-V-S) were determined in Cyperus compressus marsh (before invasion, BI), S. alterniflora-C. compressus marsh (during invasion, DI) and S. alterniflora marsh (after invasion, AI) in the Min River estuary (Southeast China) by space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the variations of sediment texture caused by S. alterniflora invasion showed great influences on the levels of TS and IS fractions in sediments at DI and AI stages. Compared with BI stage, the mean values of TS (g.kg(-1)) at AI and DI stages increased by 21.36% and 20.57%, while those of TIS (mg.kg(-1)) increased by 24.84% and 20.59%, respectively. Over all sampling seasons, significantly higher contents of W-S-S, A-S and H-S-S in sediments at AI or DI stages were observed compared to BI stage (p < 0.05). However, only the contents of H-V-S in sediments at DI and AI stage during summer or autumn were significantly higher than those at BI stage (p < 0.05). Moreover, compared with BI stage, the average stocks (g.m(-2)) of TS and TIS in sediments of all sampling seasons at AI and DI stages increased by 19.84%, 25.20% and 23.58%, 22.78%, whereas the values of W-S-S, A-S, H-S-S and H-V-S increased by 20.49%, 42.53%, 22.23%, 5.28% and 14.80%, 38.48%, 24.15%, 6.47%, respectively. These results implied that, compared to C. malaccensis, the increased S stocks in sediments might be an effective strategy for S. alterniflora to successfully invade C. malaccensis in the Min River estuary and the strong tolerance of S. alterniflora to high levels of sulfide might be more favorable for boosting its competitiveness.

AB  - Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur.

AB  - A population of Ulva rotundata (Bliding, C., A critical survey of European taxa in Ulvales.  Part I.  Opt. Bot. Lund, A8 (3), 1-160) was studied for 7 months in a shallow brackish eutrophic lagoon (Prevost Lagoon, Languedoc, France).  Biomass was measured in square-meter quadrates, and algal growth in on-site cages.  Carbon and nitrogen levels were spatiotemporally monitored in Ulva thalli and in particulate organic matter.  Thalli rapidly degraded into particulate matter from the surface to the bottom, increasing nitrogen concentrations and decreasing carbon concentrations.  We propose a method for estimating algal production and possible carbon loss in this type of lagoon, based on nitrogen levels in particulate organic matter.  Algal production over the whole period can be evaluated by adding instantaneous biomass levels corresponding to the main particulate nitrogen peaks.

AB  - In this study, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) were measured in surface intertidal saltmarsh and bare tidal flat sediments along the Rudong coast. The distribution and sources of organic carbon were examined under different depositional environments based on C/N ratios and a two-terminal mixing model. The results showed that the average TOC content of the vegetated saltmarsh sediments, bare tidal flat areas near vegetation (BF1), and bare tidal flat areas far from vegetation (BF2) were 4.05, 2.72, and 1.22 mg/g, respectively. The mean delta C-13 value within the vegetated saltmarsh area was -22.37 parts per thousand, and the C/N ratio was 9.3; the corresponding values in the BF1 area were -23.27 parts per thousand and 7.95, respectively; and in the BF2 area, the corresponding values were -21.91 parts per thousand and 5.36, respectively. These C/N ratios reflect an increasing marine contribution with distance from the vegetated zone. Combined with the two-terminal mixing model, the organic carbon in the vegetated saltmarsh sediments was dominated by terrestrial sources, while the bare tidal flat sediments were more influenced by marine sources, and the bare tidal flat sediments nearer to the vegetated zone (BF1) were influenced by a combination of vegetation, marine sources, and other terrestrial factors.

AB  - The surface morphology and sediment characteristics of introduced Spartina anglica marshes of the Tamar Estuary were analysed using a combination of spatial mapping, land-based topographical surveys, sediment coring and identification of the pre-introduction surface. Such a morphological investigation of estuarine change following Spartina introduction has not been attempted elsewhere before. A difference was found between marshes in upper and lower estuary. Surface topography of Type-1 marshes of the upper estuary was found to be independent of the pre-Spartina surface morphology, with deeper vertical development and exhibiting a flat to slightly concave upper marsh, a convex ridge in the outer mid marsh, and a relatively steeply graded convex lower marsh. Type-2 marshes of the lower estuary were thinner in vertical development, and with surface topography dictated by the underlying pre-Spartina surface. The difference was found to be due to variations in environmental conditions in sediment supply and wave/current exposure between the two regions rather being an indication of relative maturity. The seaward edge of marshes was found to be 0.5 m lower at the seaward end of the Tamar relative to the landward, reflecting tidal amplification up this confined estuary. While Spartina marshes are accretionary, surveys demonstrated retreat of the seaward margins throughout the estuary over the past 17 years, and the development of erosional scarps in Type-1 marshes. Spatial mapping identified 374 ha of S. anglica infestation within the Tamar Estuary, with Type-1 marshes occupying 240 ha and Type-2 marshes occupying 134 ha. Topographic profiles and stratigraphic data were used to estimate total sediment volumes trapped by Spartina in the Tamar Estuary, finding approximately 1,193,441 m(3) of material to have been trapped beneath Spartina since its introduction in 1947, of which between 14 and 28% has been Spartina-derived organic matter.

AB  - Production of soil gases is important in nutrient and carbon cycling, particularly in peatlands due to their large atmospheric emissions of several greenhouse gases. We examined factors controlling aerobic and anaerobic soil respiration in three contrasting types of freshwater North Carolina peatland communities (short pocosins, tall pocosins and gum swamps) which occur along a natural soil nutrient availability gradient. Short pocosins occur in the ombrotrophic center of the bog complexes and are extremely nutrient-deficient; tall pocosins are slightly less nutrient-deficient; and gum swamps are relatively nutrient-rich. Short pocosin had the lowest soil CO2 production rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratory experiments, while rates in tall pocosin were similar to or somewhat less than in the gum swamp. Methanogenesis rates were extremely low in laboratory experiments, and indicate that CH4 production is not a significant pathway of carbon flow in these peatlands. Methane production is also low in relation to other peatlands. Amendment experiments indicate that the poor substrate quality of the highly decomposed, humified peat limits both CO2 and CH4 production rates, even though the peat is 95% organic matter. Low soil nutrient concentrations and low pH do not directly limit soil respiration in these peatlands, although there is a positive feedback of nutrients with organic matter inputs and litter quality, causing greater soil respiration in nutrient-rich sites.
   In situ CO2 emissions similarly differed between the communities, with highest rates in the gum swamp and lowest rates in the pocosins. Emissions were highly seasonal with soil temperature explaining the majority of the temporal variability. Maximum potential CH, emission estimates derived from laboratory temperature relationships and in situ soil temperature data indicate that pocosins make an insignificant contribution to the global atmospheric CH4 flux. The continued existence of peatlands in warm climates may to a large extent depend on the low substrate quality of their soil organic matter, which maintains low decomposition rates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB  - All fishery food webs are ultimately underpinned by organic matter produced by algae and plants, some of it supplied by primary producers at the fringes of fish habitats. This is no different in tropical and subtropical estuaries where secondary production by crustaceans and finfish may depend on coastal wetlands (e.g. mangroves, seagrass, saltmarshes) abutting channels. Coastal urbanisation is a major cause of wetland loss globally. Hypothetically, reduced wetland area may propagate to less fisheries production if wetland contributions to food webs are substantial - this is the prime question addressed here. We sampled key fisheries species in subtropical estuaries in reaches of moderate urbanisation (18-33% of shoreline hardened) and in reference locations dominated by wetlands, on the east coast of Australia. We used triple stable isotopes (C, N, S) to estimate (using mixing models) the trophic contributions of the key primary producers to regional fisheries species. Organic matter from wetland plants, particularly saltmarsh grass (Sporobolus virginicus), underpinned fishery food webs in most cases (with median contributions ranging from 18 to 88% for saltmarsh grass, followed by 6-70% for C3 wetland plants (e.g. mangroves, phragmites) and 3-36% by benthic algae). Moderate levels of urban transformation of estuarine margins did not change the dominance of wetland carbon for fish and crustaceans in settings without significant seagrass meadows. Given the demonstrated importance of saltmarshes, and other coastal wetlands, to regional fisheries production, conservation of these habitats is necessary in the face of multiple anthropogenic threats.

AB  - Human-caused shifts in carbon (C) cycling and biotic exchange are defining characteristics of the Anthropocene. In marine systems, saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitats-collectively known as "blue carbon" and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)-are a leading sequester of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in invaded CVHs amounting to 40% (+/- 16%) higher C storage than uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders. Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal systems.

AB  - Physiological measurements were used to investigate the dependence of photosynthesis on light, temperature, and intercellular carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the C-4 marsh grass Spartina alterniflora. Functional relationships between these environmental variables and S. alterniflora physiological responses were then used to improve C-4-leaf photosynthesis models. Field studies were conducted in monocultures of S. alterniflora in Virginia, USA. On average, S. alterniflora exhibited lower light saturation values (similar to 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) than observed in other C-4 plants. Maximum carbon assimilation rates and stomatal conductance to water vapor diffusion were 36 mu mol (CO2) m(-2) s(-1) and 200 mmol (H2O) m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Analysis of assimilation-intercellular CO2 and light response relationships were used to determine Arrhenius-type temperature functions for maximum rate of carboxylation (V (cmax)), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity (V (pmax)), and maximum electron transport rate (J (max)). Maximum V (cmax) values of 105 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were observed at the leaf temperature of 311 K. Optimum V (pmax) values (80.6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were observed at the foliage temperature of 308 K. The observed V (pmax) values were lower than those in other C-4 plants, whereas V (cmax) values were higher, and more representative of C-3 plants. Optimum J (max) values reached 138 mu mol (electrons) m(-2) s(-1) at the foliage temperature of 305 K. In addition, the estimated CO2 compensation points were in the range of C-3 or C-3-C-4 intermediate plants, not those typical of C-4 plants. The present results indicate the possibility of a C-3-C-4 intermediate or C-4-like photosynthetic mechanism rather than the expected C-4-biochemical pathway in S. alterniflora under field conditions. In a scenario of atmospheric warming and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, S. alterniflora will likely respond positively to both changes. Such responses will result in increased S. alterniflora productivity, which is uncharacteristic of C-4 plants.

AB  - Net organic metabolism (that is, the difference between primary production and respiration of organic matter) in the coastal ocean may be a significant term in the oceanic carbon budget. Historical change in the rate of this net metabolism determines the importance of the coastal ocean relative to anthropogenic perturbations of the global carbon cycle. Consideration of long-term rates of river loading of organic carbon, organic burial, chemical reactivity of land-derived organic matter, and rates of community metabolism in the coastal zone leads us to estimate that the coastal zone oxidizes about 7 x 10(12) moles C/yr. The open ocean is apparently also a site of net organic oxidation (approximately 16 x 10(12) moles C/yr). Thus organic metabolism in the ocean appears to be a source Of CO2 release to the atmosphere rather than being a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The small area of the coastal ocean accounts for about 30% of the net oceanic oxidation. Oxidation in the coastal zone (especially in bays and estuaries) takes on particular importance, because the input rate is likely to have been altered substantially by human activities on land.

AB  - Because coastal habitats store large amounts of organic carbon (C-org), the conservation and restoration of these habitats are considered to be important measures for mitigating global climate change. Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C-org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C-org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrass-saltmarsh habitats. Age-depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C-org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C-org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C-org sequestration in coastal habitats.

AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands are among the most productive, ecologically valuable, and economically important ecosystems on Earth. Through tidal inundation and lateral export, estuarine marshes exert a strong influence on the amount and quality of carbon and nutrients exchanged between the land and the ocean. Yet, current understanding of the role of these "blue carbon" ecosystems on estuarine optics, biogeochemistry, and ecology is largely based on limited field observations at point locations, due to the coarse resolution of existing and heritage satellite ocean color sensors. Here, for the first time, we merged high resolution data from the constellation of Landsat-8/ Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) to examine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in a tidally influenced marsh-estuarine system. Often referred to as the "Everglades of the North", the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is the largest marsh system in the Chesapeake Bay and one of the most ecologically important areas in the United States. A multiple linear regression approach linking DOC to the spectral shape of water remote sensing reflectance was used to capture marsh DOC export and examine spatial features and temporal changes in DOC over a broad range of conditions (DOC in the range of 2.32-19.9 mg/L), across multiple years, different seasons, and tidal regimes, with a relative error (mean average percent difference) of 23%. Data consistency between satellite sensors was evaluated, followed by the generation of a long term, multi-sensor DOC data record that provided more frequent observations. Combining data from the three satellites revealed the strong impact of marsh outwelling at the larger ecosystem scale, its seasonal variability, and the importance of other environmental factors, including wind conditions, river discharge, and extreme weather events, in shaping DOC dynamics along complex, tidally influenced terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.

AB  - Classification of the vegetation of the Farasan Islands using TWINSPAN technique resulted in the recognition of seven community types associated with seven different habitat types: silty runnels, palm orchards, rocky plains, rocky plateau crevices, coastal sand dunes, sand plains, and mangroves. These communities were dominated or co-dominated by 13 perennial species; 87 associate species were recorded in the study area with chamaephytes dominating the life-form spectrum. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated that organic carbon, soil moisture, silt, electrical conductivity and calcium carbonate were the major edaphic gradients controlling the distribution of the plant communities on the Farasan Islands.
   Higher species richness was recorded in the plant communities inhabiting the palm orchards, the crevices of the rocky plateau, silty runnels, rocky plains and rocky plateau, while those of the mangrove and sand formations (dunes and plains) showed a lower species richness.
   Soil texture and organic matter are the main factors promoting species diversity in the more diversified habitats, while high salinity and calcium carbonate are the main factors associated with lower species diversity in the less diversified habitats of the study area.

AB  - Estuaries and coastal wetlands are critical transition zones (CTZs) that link land, freshwater habitats, and the sea. CTZs provide essential ecological functions, including decomposition, nutrient cycling, and nutrient production, as well as regulation of fluxes of nutrients, water, particles, and organisms to and from land, rivers, and the ocean. Sediment-associated biota are integral to these functions. Functional groups considered essential to CTZ processes include heterotrophic bacteria and fungi, as well as many benthic invertebrates. Key invertebrate functions include shredding, which breaks down and recycles organic matter; suspension feeding, which collects and transports sediments across the sediment-water interface; and bioturbating, which moves sediment into or out of the seabed. In addition, macrophytes regulate many aspects of nutrient, particle, and organism dynamics above- and belowground. Animals moving within or through CTZs are vectors that transport nutrients and organic matter across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine interfaces. Significant threats to biodiversity within CTZs are posed by anthropogenic influences; eutrophication, nonnutrient pollutants, species invasions, overfishing, habitat alteration, and climate change affect species richness or composition in many coastal environments. Because biotic diversity in marine CTZ sediments is inherently low whereas their functional significance is great, shifts in diversity are likely to be particularly important. Species introductions (from invasion) or loss (from overfishing or habitat alteration) provide evidence that single-species changes can have overt, sweeping effects on CTZ structure and function. Certain species may be critically important to the maintenance of ecosystem functions in CTZs even though at present there is limited empirical evidence that the number of species in CTZ sediments is critical. We hypothesized that diversity is indeed important to ecosystem function in marine CTZs because high diversity maintains positive interactions among species (facilitation and mutualism), promoting stability and resistance to invasion or other forms of disturbance. The complexity of interactions among species and feedbacks with ecosystem functions suggests that comparative (mensurative) and manipulative approaches will be required to elucidate the role of diversity in sustaining CTZ functions.

AB  - Rates and pathways of organic matter decomposition in sediments were examined during winter and summer in two mangrove forests and two accreting mud flats in Hinchinbrook Channel, north-eastern Australia. Rates of O-2 consumption (range: 2.8-61.0 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and CO2 release (range: 1.8-21.9 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) were faster in winter than in summer. Low respiratory quotients (CO2/O-2 range: 0.24-1.08) and a comparison of other metabolic pathways with total carbon oxidation (T-cox) in summer suggests that most O-2 was used in oxidizing reduced solutes. Rates of total carbon oxidation were greater in the mangrove sediments than in the mud flats. In winter, sulphate reduction in the mangroves (range: 4.9-8.3 mmol S m(-2) day(-1)) accounted for a much greater proportion (45-78%) of T-cox than in the mud flats where sulphate reduction (range: 0.8-1.0 mmol S m(-2) day(-1)) was a minor (12-14% of T-cox) metabolic pathway. In summer, sulphate reduction accounted for a greater (62-->100%) proportion of T-cox in both mangrove (range: 7.9-10.1 mmol S m(-2) day(-1)) and mud flat (range: 0.8-2.3 mmol S m(-2) day(-1)) sediments. Rates of denitrification in summer were rapid but highly Variable at all four sites (range: 2.9-6.9 mmol N-2 m(-2) day(-1)). Rates of Fe and Mn reduction were slow at all four sites (range: 0.0-0.27 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) suggesting that metal reduction was a minor decomposition pathway. No methane was detected in the porewater or released from sediments at any of the sites. There was no net microalgal primary production at any of the sites. Mineralization efficiency of organic carbon was low (9-14%) at the most sheltered mud flat, but efficiencies were greater (44-60%) and nearly equivalent at less sheltered mud flat and mangrove habitats, respectively. Imbalances of mineralized carbon between the sum of the various pathways and T-cox, particularly at the mangrove sites, suggest unaccounted losses of dissolved carbon. Large seasonal changes in porewater Cl- concentrations and lack of solute concentration differences with overlying tidal water, imply dilution and tidal advection and/or drainage of interstitial water by intense summer rains.

AB  - Wetland soils act as a sink or source of phosphorus (P) to the overlaying water due to phosphorus sorption-desorption processes. Litter information is available on sorption and desorption behaviors of phosphorus in coastal wetlands with different flooding conditions. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate phosphorus sorption-desorption processes, fractions of adsorbed phosphorus, and the effects of salinity, pH and temperature on phosphorus sorption on soils in tidal-flooding wetlands (TW), freshwater-flooding wetlands (FW) and seasonal-flooding wetlands (SW) in the Yellow River Delta. Our results showed that the freshly adsorbed phosphorus dominantly exists in Occluded-P and Fe/Al-P and their percentages increased with increasing phosphorus adsorbed. Phosphorus sorption isotherms could be better described by the modified Langmuir model than by the modified Freundlich model. A binomial equation could be properly used to describe the effects of salinity, pH, and temperature on phosphorus sorption. Phosphorus sorption generally increased with increasing salinity, pH, and temperature at lower ranges, while decreased in excess of some threshold values. The maximum phosphorus sorption capacity (Q(max)) was larger for FW soils (256 mg/kg) compared with TW (218 mg/kg) and SW soils (235 mg/kg) (p < 0.05). The percentage of phosphorus desorption (P-des) in the FW soils (7.5-63.5%) was much lower than those in TW (27.7-124.9%) and SW soils (19.2-108.5%). The initial soil organic matter, pH and the exchangeable Al, Fe and Cd contents were important factors influencing P sorption and desorption. The findings of this study indicate that freshwater restoration can contribute to controlling the eutrophication status of water bodies through increasing P sorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Low-level saltwater intrusion and ferric iron (Fe(III)) loading are predicted for many mineral tidal freshwater ecosystems under sea-level rise. To assess their effects on the carbon mineralization processes, in-situ experiments were conducted with four treatments: Fe(III) amendment, saltwater addition, saltwater addition plus Fe (III) amendment, and a control. Soil and porewater samples (0-30 cm) were collected to assess geochemical properties and soil incubation on Days 460 and 580 after the start of the experiment. Saltwater addition increased the salinity from freshwater (0.1 mg.g(-1)) to oligohaline (< 2 mg.g(-1)) and elevated the concentrations of porewater Cl-, SO42-, and NH4+. Fe(III) amendment increased the concentrations of soil Fe(III), Fe(II), and total reduced sulfur (TRS). Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition enhanced the belowground biomass of marsh plants, while neither affected the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) pools or their ratios. Both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition improved the overall mineralization rates (i.e., CO2 plus CH4 production) of the soil at 0-10 cm depths. Methanogenesis decreased under both Fe(III) amendment and saltwater addition. Strong negative relationships were observed between methanogenesis rates and the concentrations of porewater Cl- and SO42-, and soil Fe(III). Relative to the individual Fe(III) and saltwater treatments, the combined treatment did not further promote overall mineralization rates or further impede methanogenesis potential. Methanogenesis and Fe(III) reduction co-dominated the overall mineralization in the control treatment. Individual loading of Fe(III) and saltwater into the soils induced the predominance of Fe(III) and sulfate reduction, respectively. Under the combined treatment, microbial Fe(III) and sulfate reduction codominated the overall mineralization, but restrained each other. The shifts in the partitioning of mineralization pathways among treatments were primarily influenced by porewater Cl- and SO42-, followed by Fe(III), and then DOC. Together, the results suggest that the projected modest levels of saltwater intrusion and Fe(III) loading may simultaneously accelerate the belowground C input and mineralization rates, shifting anaerobic pathways away from CH4 production towards Fe(III) and sulfate reduction.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs) are in global decline and sensitive to climate change; yet may also assist its mitigation through high rates of 'blue' carbon sequestration and storage. Alterations of relative sea-level (RSL) are pervasive drivers of change that reflect the interaction between tidal inundation regimes and ground surface elevation. Although many studies have investigated sediment accretion within VCEs, relatively few have addressed spatiotemporal patterns of resilience in response to RSL change. In this study, we used high resolution elevation models and field surveys to identify RSL changes and socio-ecological responses in a tidal lagoon system following earthquakes in New Zealand. We expected that vegetation changes would result from RSL effects caused by surface-elevation changes in intertidal zones. Elevation measurements showed a sequence of vertical displacements resulting from major earthquakes in 2011 and 2012, and additional surface-elevation loss since. VCE losses were recorded over an 8 year period post-2011 in response to high rates of RSL rise (up to 41 mm yr(-1)). Anthropogenic factors influenced the pattern of losses and illustrate opportunities for managing risks to other VCEs facing RSL rise. Four key principles for building VCE resilience were identified: i) anthropogenic encroachment results in resilience loss due to the need for landward migration when changes exceed the tolerance thresholds of VCEs at their lower elevational limits; ii) connectivity losses exacerbate encroachment effects, and conversely, are a practical focus for management; iii) landscape-scale risk exposure is disproportionately influenced by the largest wetland remnants illustrating the importance of site-specific vulnerabilities and their assessment; and iv) establishing new protected areas to accommodate the movement of VCEs is needed, and requires a combination of land tenure rearrangements and connectivity conservation. Embracing these concepts offers promise for improving whole-system resilience to help address the challenge of global climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exchange of water between the main channel of the tidal freshwater Hudson River and its tidal wetlands is a large proportion of the whole-river water volume and causes large changes in concentrations of some dissolved and suspended constituents. Ten representative wetlands were assessed for their ability to alter quantities of inorganic nutrients, suspended particles, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved oxygen during tidal exchange. The majority of sites acted as sinks for oxygen and nitrate and as sources of DOC. For other variables such as phosphate and pigments, individual wetlands varied broadly in both the direction and magnitude of change. For some variables (oxygen, DOC) we found mechanistically plausible predictors for the magnitude of alteration. The proportional coverage of submerged vegetation or intertidal marsh graminoid vegetation was related to the degree of change in oxygen and DOC. For most cases, however, we did not find strong predictors and we attribute this to the spatial positioning of "hot spots" or redundancy in the processes actually responsible for the transformation. Our ability to predict ecosystem performance from whole-ecosystem attributes may be impeded by lack of consideration of within-system spatial contingencies or lack of knowledge of which process is actually responsible for the observed alteration in material flux.

AB  - Methane production is influenced by the abundance of methanogens and the availability of substrates. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) also play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, the relationships between methane production and abundance of methanogen and pore water substrates in estuarine brackish marshes are poorly characterized, and even to our knowledge, no published research has explored the relationship between methane production rate and pore water dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentration. We investigated methane production rate, abundances of methanogens and SRB, sediment organic carbon contents, and concentrations of pore water substrates (acetate and DMS) and terminal electron acceptors (SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), and Fe3+) at a brackish marsh landscape dominated by Phragmites australis marsh, Cyperus malaccensis marsh, and Spartina alterniflora marsh in the Min River estuary, southeast China. The average rates of methane production over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile (5 cm sampling interval) in the three marshes were 0.142, 0.058, and 0.067 mu g g(-1) day(-1), respectively. The abundance of both methanogens and SRB in the sediment of the P. australis marsh with the highest sediment organic carbon content was higher than in the C. malaccensis and S. alterniflora marshes. Mean pore water DMS concentrations over the entire 30 cm of the sediment profile under the S. alterniflora marsh were higher than those in the C. malaccensis marsh and P. australis marsh. Methane production rate correlated weakly with the abundance of methanogens across the three marsh zones together, but did not correlate with the concentrations of pore water acetate and DMS. Our results suggest that the abundance of methanogens is controlled by sediment organic carbon supply, and further, methane production is affected by the abundance of methanogens in the subtropical estuarine brackish marshes.

AB  - We used a combination of field and laboratory techniques to examine the relative importance of food webs based on marsh detritus, benthic algae, or phytoplankton in supporting growth of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus. We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare the growth of newly metamorphosed juveniles fed natural diets from potential settlement habitats such as marshes. The experimental diets consisted of zooplankton, Uca pugnax and Littoraria irrorata tissue, a mixture of plant detritus and associated meiofauna and detritus only. Crabs fed the zooplankton diet showed the fastest growth and reached a mean dry weight of 32.4 mg, from an initial dry weight of 0.8 mg, during a 3 wk period. Based on the isotopic composition, juvenile crabs obtain carbon and nitrogen from various food sources. For example, crabs fed zooplankton obtained their nutrition from phytoplankton derived organic matter. consistent with zooplankton feeding on phytoplankton. The mean delta(13)C values for juveniles fed detritus and detritus-plus-meiofauna were considerably lighter (delta(13)C = 19 parts per thousand), than that of their respective diets (delta(13)C = -16 parts per thousand), suggesting that crabs were selectively ingesting prey items that obtain their nutrition from an isotopically Lighter carbon source like phytoplankton. Conversely, crabs fed U, pugnax or L, irrorata had isotopic ratios (delta(13)C = 16 to -14 parts per thousand) consistent with these species feeding on isotopically heavier marsh grass carbon. Isotopic ratios of crabs collected in the field appeared to corroborate the experiment and suggest that either Spartina alterniflora detritus or benthic algae-based food webs supported juvenile crab growth in marsh environments, whereas phytoplankton-based food webs dominate habitats more closely associated with the main estuary.

AB  - We determined the concentration of seston, particulate organic matter, and biological components (chlorophyll a, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates) for <25 mum size fraction seston over five seasons in Canary Creek saltmarsh, Delaware Bay, USA. This material is the potential food resource for suspension-feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, that inhabit the marsh intertidal zone. For eight tidal cycles each season we collected water six times at hourly intervals from mid-flood tide to mid-ebb tide. Although the concentration of seston did not vary seasonally, there were significant seasonal variations (analysis of variance, P < 0.05) in seston components, with chlorophyll a concentration being highest in May and bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates most abundant in August. Seston composition also varied within each tidal cycle with a magnitude as great as the seasonal variation. We conclude that ribbed mussels are subject to an unpredictable food supply that varies in composition and concentration on the order of hours and days. In contrast to the pronounced temporal changes, seston characteristics did not differ significantly among sampling locations within the marsh, or between samples collected close to the sediment surface and from the upper water column. Resuspension of sediment particles caused by tidal flow was not evident in tidal creeks and there were no dominant patterns in total seston concentration corresponding to tidal stages (flood tide, high slack water, and ebb tide) over the five sampling months. The abundance of biological components in the seston, including chlorophyll a, bacteria, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, were significantly greater during high flood tide and high slack water than during ebb tide. The decline of biological components, particularly chlorophyll a in the ebb tide, indicates that this temperate saltmarsh imported organic material produced in the Delaware estuary.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a crucial driver in ecosystem services and a central part of the carbon transport and biological cycle in land-sea interaction. DOM exhibits characteristic environmental behavior in the coastal zone, but its sustainability is affected by expanding artificial topography (AT) construction. It requires combining analyses on AT-induced response of field fluorescent DOM (fDOM) and its quenching pattern under metal-complexation. Herein, we conducted systemic investigations into the spatiotemporal dynamics of fDOM compositions with further in-lab verification to study its Cu-binding capacity. We detected three humid-like fDOM components sensitive to AT. The total fDOM intensity was positively correlated with low molecular weight organic acid (LMWOA) extractable Cu and the Cu pools in above-ground biomass. The enriched fDOM serves as an ecological engineer by increasing the Cu mobility, confirmed by an in-lab fluorescence titration. The application of LMWOA greatly enhanced the intensity of one fDOM component, elevated its conditional stability constant, and decreased its quenched proportion, implying that LMWOA might extract part of Cu from fDOM complexation. The present work provides an "fDOM-LMWOA pump" explanation to suggest that fDOM is a novel ecological regulator on vegetation growth under the AT-induced matter accumulation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seven sediment push-cores were extracted from Chiricahueto, a marsh affect by urban, industrial and agricultural wastes. Concentrations of total phosphorus (300-1,620 mug g(-1)), organic carbon (4-39 mg g(-1)) and total nitrogen (0.5-4.5 mg g(-1)) in the sediments showed an exponential decrease with depth, related to the decomposition of organic matter (OM). Between 20 and 40% of OM initially deposited is degraded at the sediment-water interface under oxic conditions. Another fraction (40-60%) of non-refractory OM is decomposed within the sediments by oxidants other than oxygen. likewise, the preservation of OM (<20%) was estimated as burial concentrations of C, N and P linked to organic compounds. The C/N ratios, delta(13)C and delta(15)N suggested that the major source of OM to the sediments derives from marine phytoplankton. The allochthonous sources of OM were overprinted by the high flux of marine autochthonous OM. However, an indirect terrestrial influence is recognised, in which high nutrient load derived from agricultural, domestic and industrial activities promoted high productivity.

AB  - Litter is decomposed in a sequential process. In a concerted action animals and microorganisms break down complex organic matter to mineral products. Higher animals fragment and partially solubilize plant material. Subsequently, microorganisms (protozoa, fungi and bacteria) further degrade the organic matter to end products that cannot be metabolized further under the prevailing environmental conditions. During the process of decomposition some parts of the organic substrate and the excess energy are used to form new biomass. Some free organic intermediates may interact chemically to form relatively recalcitrant organic matter, such as humic substances. The degree of mineralization depends strongly on the type of organic matter in the litter and the physical and chemical conditions of the environment.

AB  - Globally, wetlands provide the largest terrestrial carbon (C) store, and restoration of degraded wetlands provides a potentially important mechanism for climate change mitigation. We examined the potential for restored saltmarshes to sequester carbon, and found that they can provide a modest, but sustained, sink for atmospheric CO2. Rates of C and nutrient cycling were measured and compared between a natural saltmarsh (high- and low-shore locations), claimed arable land on former high-shore saltmarsh and a managed realignment restoration site (high- and low-shore) in transition from agricultural land to saltmarsh 15 years after realignment, at Tollesbury, Essex, UK. We measured pools and turnover of C and nitrogen (N) in soil and vegetation at each site using a range of methods, including gas flux measurement and isotopic labelling. The natural high-shore site had the highest soil organic matter concentrations, topsoil C stock and below-ground biomass, whereas the agricultural site had the highest total extractable N concentration and lowest soil C/N ratio. Ecosystem respiration rates were similar across all three high-shore sites, but much higher in both low-shore sites, which receive regular inputs of organic matter and nutrients from the estuary. Total evolution of C-14-isotopically labelled substrate as CO2 was highest at the agricultural site, suggesting that low observed respiration rates here were due to low substrate supply (following a recent harvest) rather than to inherently low microbial activity. The results suggest that, after 15 years, the managed realignment site is not fully equivalent to the natural saltmarsh in terms of biological and chemical function. While above ground biomass, extractable N and substrate mineralisation rates in the high-shore site were all quite similar to the natural site, less dynamic ecosystem properties including soil C stock, C/N ratio and below-ground biomass all remained more similar to the agricultural site. These results suggest that reversion to natural biogeochemical functioning will occur following restoration, but is likely to be slow; we estimate that it will take approximately 100 years for the restored site to accumulate the amount of C currently stored in the natural site, at a rate of 0.92 t C ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB  - Gulf of Mexico saltmarsh sediments were heavily impacted by Macondo well oil (MWO) released from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Detailed molecular-level characterization of sediment extracts collected over 48 months post-spill highlights the chemical complexity of highly polar, oxygen-containing compounds that remain environmentally persistent. Electrospray ionization (ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS), combined with chromatographic prefractionation, correlates bulk chemical properties to elemental compositions of oil-transformation products as a function of time. Carboxylic acid incorporation into parent MWO hydrocarbons detected in sediment extracts (corrected for mass loss relative to C-30 hopane) proceeds with an increase of similar to 3-fold in O-2 species after 9 months to a maximum of a similar to 5.5-fold increase after 36 months, compared to the parent MWO. More importantly, higher-order oxygenated compounds (O-4-O-6) not detected in the parent MWO increase in relative abundance with time as lower-order oxygenated species are transformed into highly polar, oxygen-containing compounds (O-x, where x > 3). Here, we present the first molecular-level characterization of temporal compositional changes that occur in Deepwater Horizon derived oil contamination deposited in a saltmarsh ecosystem from 9 to 48 months post-spill and identify highly oxidized Macondo well oil compounds that are not detectable by routine gas-chromatography-based techniques.

AB  - Shaped by the hydrology of the Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades watershed, the Florida Everglades is composed of a conglomerate of wetland ecosystems that have varying capacities to sequester and store carbon. Hydrology, which is a product of the region's precipitation and temperature patterns combined with water management policy, drives community composition and productivity. As shifts in both precipitation and air temperature are expected over the next 100 years as a consequence of climate change, CO2 dynamics in the greater Everglades are expected to change. To reduce uncertainties associated with climate change and to explore how projected changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate can alter current CO2 exchange rates in Everglades freshwater marsh ecosystems, we simulated fluxes of carbon among the atmosphere, vegetation, and soil using the DAYCENT model. We explored the effects of low, moderate, and high scenarios for atmospheric CO2 (550, 850, and 950 ppm), mean annual air temperature (+1, +2.5, and +4.2 degrees C) and precipitation (-2, +7, and +14%), as predicted by the IPCC for the year 2100 for the region, on CO2 exchange rates in short- and long-hydroperiod wetland ecosystems. Under 100 years of current climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration, Everglades freshwater marsh ecosystems were estimated to be CO2-neutral. As atmospheric CO2 concentration increased and under climate change projections, there were slight shifts in the start and length of the wet season (-1 to +7 days) and a small enhancement in the sink capacity (by -169 to -573 g C m(-2) century(-1)) occurred at both short- and long-hydroperiod ecosystems compared to CO2 dynamics under the current climate regime. Over 100 years, rising temperatures increased net CO2 exchange rates (+1 to 13 g C m(-2) century(-1)) and shifts in precipitation patterns altered cumulative net carbon uptake by +13 to -46 g C m(-2) century(-1). While changes in ecosystem structure, species composition, and disturbance regimes were beyond the scope of this research, results do indicate that climate change will produce small changes in CO2 dynamics in Everglades freshwater marsh ecosystems and suggest that the hydrologic regime and oligotrophic conditions of Everglades freshwater marshes lowers the ecosystem sensitivity to climate change.

AB  - A dated sediment core from a highly-fertilized mangrove wetland located in Cubatao (SE Brazil) presented a negative correlation between mercury (Hg) and organic carbon contents. This is an unusual result for a metal with well-known affinity to organic matter. A dilution of Hg concentrations by autochthonous organic matter explained this observation, as revealed by carbon stable isotopes signatures (delta C-13). Mercury dilution by the predominant mangrove-derived organic matter counterbalanced the positive influences of algal-derived organic matter and clay contents on Hg levels, suggesting that deleterious effects of Hg may be attenuated. Considering the current paradigm on the positive effect of organic matter on Hg concentrations in coastal sediments and the expected increase in mangrove organic matter burial due to natural and anthropogenic stimulations of primary production, predictions on the influences of organic matter on Hg accumulation in mangrove wetlands deserve caution.

AB  - The aim was to review ecosystem state changes and the role of palaeo-ecological tools with application to intertidal subtropical and tropical intertidal wetlands. These systems are especially vulnerable to stress from sea-level change, climate change, and development activities. Responses to stress can lead to significant state changes with the system passing thresholds, potentially beyond recovery. Indicators of state changes and approaching tipping points include a critical slowing down following perturbation signalled by, for example, slowing recovery rates, increased attribute variance, and changed skewness. To identify such changes, data are needed for the relevant variables such as vegetation, sea level, and sediment processes so as to observe the indicative changes and their timing. Because changes may be relatively slow in ecological terms, very long-term data are needed to inform management about future likely states or thresholds so that mitigation or adaptation can be planned. One approach is to use palaeo-ecological data. These data are relatively scarce in tropical intertidal systems. This paper reviews a range of palaeo-indicators. These include state indicators (pollen, foraminifera, and diatoms), stable isotope analysis, and stratigraphy and temporal indicators involving sediment dating. Each is potentially useful, although there are uncertainties related to, for example, the redistribution organic matter in sediment cores. In conclusion, it is recommended that integrating or combining several indicators can assist in triangulating results, thereby increasing confidence in their interpretation. It is also suggested that data, if available, can be retrofitted to assess at least some of the state change indicators, such as data variance and skewness.

AB  - A study was made of the microbiological processes of production and destruction of organic matter (OM) in Santa Fe mangroves. Significant amounts of OM and high temperatures promote activity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the mangrove waters and sediments. Rates of dark fixation in a water column reach 25.0 +/- 2.5-mu-g C/(liter. day) and 3.0-8.74 mg C/(kg.day) in sediments. Proteolytic bacteria are active in OM destruction; they mineralize 161.4-227 mg protein in 1 kg sediment per day. Cellulolytic bacteria decompose 3.5-9.1 mg C/(kg.day). For reducing sulfates, 4.08-92.0 mg C is expended and for synthesis of CH4, 0.01-0.03 mg C.

AB  - I tested the hypothesis that seiches in large lakes play a role similar to tides in marine system by exporting detrital carbon from coastal wetlands to adjacent open waters. The study was conducted at a wetland site located along the shore of the Lake Erie. Water samples were collected at the outlet of the marsh, during inflow and outflow events, over a 19-month period. Water isotopes were also measured in the lake and in the marsh to establish the magnitude of the mixing between the two water masses. On average, the concentrations of the outflow water samples was enriched by 7.3 mg DOC l(-1) and 3.4 mg POC l(-1)compared to the inflow water samples, while no difference observed in inorganic carbon fluxes. Organic carbon was exported during fall, winter and early spring which coincide with period of organic matter decomposition. Such a concept of outwelling is not new for marine ecosystem, but is demonstrated in this study for the first time in a large lake setting influenced by seiche events. Ultimately to understand the role that these fluxes may play in maintaining the integrity of the wetland-lake system, it will be necessary to investigate whether the detrital material exported from coastal freshwater wetlands is incorporated into the open lake foodweb.

AB  - The sediments that are preserved in estuarine environments (saltmarsh, riverine estuaries, mangrove habitats, lagoons, isolation basins and fjords) contain organic matter that allows investigation of the provenance of that material. These data can then be used specifically to investigate past sea level/land level changes and changes in freshwater flux. Where microfossils are poorly preserved or absent, C/N and delta C-13 analyses offer an alternative method to deduce environmental histories, but they are especially useful when used in conjunction with a range of other proxies, and when local modern end-member organic variables can be measured to 'calibrate' the sedimentary C/N and delta C-13. There are a wide range of C/N-delta C-13 based carbon studies, here we describe examples of studies in a variety of estuarine environments.

AB  - In the marine realm picoplanktonic cyanobacteria (PC) show a broad distribution from the surface ocean to the offshore and coastal waters of semi-enclosed seas and, because of their photoheterotrophy, they are responsible for a substantial fraction of both primary production and organic matter degradation/utilization. In the present study, we investigated PC distribution related to some physical-chemical parameters (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen), in the most productive periods of the year, spring and fall, at 37 stations located in seven transitional systems all along the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea: Grado and Marano, Venezia, Pialassa Baiona, Margherita di Savoia, Torre Guaceto, Cesine and Alimini. The aim of the study was to determine if PC are common elements of these transitional systems (lagoons, marshes and solar salterns) or whether they are only occasionally important during stochastic bloom events. PC mean abundances were all over the seven habitats more than one order of magnitude higher (> 5 x 10(7) cells L-1) than those found in coastal and offshore waters of the Adriatic Sea. Their range of variability was also broader (10(5)-10(9) cells L-1 vs. 10(6)-10(8) cells L-1). PC populations appeared well adapted to ample variations in salinity (5-87). The highest abundances (close to 109 cells L-1) were found at extremely high/low salinity values. Even oxygen concentrations close to hypoxia did not seem to negatively affect PC abundances. Because of their ability in adapting to extreme conditions, PC may become the prevailing fraction of the phototrophic plankton in these sites and their role in such ecosystems should not be underestimated.

AB  - River damming reduces sediment load in rivers, leading to instability and erosion of coastal deltas; this is a global issue in many large-river delta-front estuaries (LDEs). The total organic carbon, stable carbon isotope, total nitrogen, lignin phenols in suspended particulate matter, and three sediment cores collected from the Changjiang LDE were analyzed to study the effects of river damming and delta erosion on the redistribution and burial of organic carbon (OC) in the coastal margin. The OC budgets that include the delta erosion process were established to better constrain the burial fluxes of OC in the Changjiang River system before and after river damming. We used a three-end-member mixing model with Monte Carlo simulation and found that the ratio of deltaic OC to riverine OC significantly increased in estuarine SPM and sediment cores in the Changjiang LDE after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), reflective of reduced sediment load and enhanced delta erosion. Our budget showed that, compared with the pre-dam period (1953-1985), the burial of terrestrial OC in the Changjiang LDE sediments had been reduced by similar to 97.3%, on the basis of 72.7% and 82.7% reductions in sediment load and particulate OC flux, respectively. Although trapping of terrestrial OC in reservoirs is the key driver in these reductions, re exposure and decomposition of OC from eroding delta sediments also contribute significantly to OC losses in coastal sediments. On the contrary, the ratio of marine OC to riverine OC increased in sediment cores after TGD building, due in part to more inputs of marine OC because of serious eutrophication in recent decades. As continued dam construction and sea-level rise change the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon sequestration in the coastal zones of LDEs, further consideration of alterations in these carbon burial "hotspots" is needed in global carbon models.

AB  - The soil of the Elbe river marshland was classified as calcareous freshwater marsh (USDA: typic fluvaquent). Methanogenic bacteria were found in oxic as well as in anoxic soil layers. Most probable number counts varied from 1.4x10(2) to 2.5x10(6) bacteria g(-1) fresh weight. Methane production at different temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C) was studied with undisturbed soil cores. The highest methane production rates were measured at 10 degrees C (0.31 nmol h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1)) and 20 degrees C (0.58 nmol h(-1) (g d.w.)(-1)). Incubation experiments with disturbed soil material showed two optima of methane production at 10 degrees C and in the mesophilic temperature range. Experiments with different substrates indicate that at 10 degrees C acetate serves as substrate while at higher temperatures hydrogen is the main energy source for methanogens.

AB  - Spartina alterniflora was recorded in 2004 in the Great Brak Estuary, a system along the southern coast of South Africa that closes to the sea. This is alarming as this is a species with a known history as an aggressive invasive plant which has now been found 8000 km from its nearest known location and furthermore it is spreading under atypical conditions of submergence. This first recorded population in Africa indicates the adaptive potential of this invasive grass which survives inundation and non-tidal conditions for months at a time. Spartina alterniflora spread from 2566 m(2) in 2006 to a maximum area covered of 10,221 m(2) in 2011. There was an increase in silt, sediment organic matter and a significant reduction in sediment redox potential at sites invaded by S. alterniflora. When the estuary closes to the sea the water level rises and S. alterniflora is flooded, limiting opportunities for mechanical and chemical control. Application of a glyphosate-based herbicide in 2012 showed that chemical control was more effective in reducing the stands than mechanical removal. The additional use of imazapyr in 2014 significantly reduced stem density and the proportion of live stems. Spread of this invasive plant to the intertidal marshes in adjacent estuaries is a potential biodiversity threat although, fortunately, this population does not seem to produce viable seed. There is also the concern that hybridization with the resident S. maritima may occur. Important research and management questions remain i.e. how quickly will the natural marsh re-establish following eradication and how can we prevent movement of the grass to other estuaries?

AB  - Coastal wetlands can serve as a considerable sink for carbon (C) gases. However, the capacity for wetlands to serve as more permanent C and N sinks over the long term is less clear given the time dependence of sediment deposition, organic matter decomposition, and anthropogenic land use change. In this study, we compare the short-term (decadal scale) and long-term (millennial scale) C and N accumulation rates estimated using Cs-137 and radiocarbon dating of vibracores collected from a freshwater coastal wetland in the Louisiana Mississippi River deltaic plain (Atchafalaya River delta). The mean short-term (60 yrs) sediment accumulation rate was 1.4 cm/yr while the mean rate of long-term (100-1000 yrs) sediment accumulation was an order of magnitude lower at 0.12 cm/yr. Annual rates of C and N accumulated over the past several thousand years were approximately 10% of that over the past 60 years after correcting for bulk density. These results are similar to other coastal wetlands and suggest that time scale must be considered in determining the relative permanence of C and N storage in coastal wetland soils. This difference is especially important for assessing the role of C cycling in relation to global change models and N cycling related to water quality in accurately quantifying the role of coastal deltaic fresh water wetlands in regulating these biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Recent projections of climatic change have focused a great deal of scientific and public attention on patterns of carbon (C) cycling as well as its controls, particularly the factors that determine whether an ecosystem is a net source or sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Net ecosystem production (NEP), a central concept in C-cycling research, has been used by scientists to represent two different concepts. We propose that NEP be restricted to just one of its two original definitions-the imbalance between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We further propose that a new term-net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB)-be applied to the net rate of C accumulation in (or loss from [negative sign]) ecosystems. Net ecosystem carbon balance differs from NEP when C fluxes other than C fixation and respiration occur, or when inorganic C enters or leaves in dissolved form. These fluxes include the leaching loss or lateral transfer of C from the ecosystem; the emission of volatile organic C, methane, and carbon monoxide; and the release of soot and CO2 from fire. Carbon fluxes in addition to NEP are particularly important determinants of NECB over long time scales. However, even over short time scales, they are important in ecosystems such as streams, estuaries, wetlands, and cities. Recent technological advances have led to a diversity of approaches to the measurement of C fluxes at different temporal and spatial scales. These approaches frequently capture different components of NEP or NECB and can therefore be compared across scales only by carefully specifying the fluxes included in the measurements. By explicitly identifying the fluxes that comprise NECB and other components of the C cycle, such as net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome production (NBP), we can provide a less ambiguous framework for understanding and communicating recent changes in the global C cycle.

AB  - The use of riverine allochthonous organic matter by plankton in the northern Baltic Sea was studied using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Dissolved and particulate material was sampled in the main Swedish rivers entering the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea. At 4 sea stations, dissolved matter, plankton and nekton were sampled in 11 size-classes: below 0.7 mu m filtrate, 0.7-5, 5-20, 20-50, 50-100, 100-200, 200-500, 500-2500 mu m, mysids (similar to 10 and similar to 20 mm) and herring. A riverine influence could be detected in delta(13)C, but not in delta(15)N. Except for the: 5-20 mu m fraction, the carbon became enriched in C-13 with increasing salinity in all plankton size-fractions. This mainly reflected differences in the delta(13)C Of phytoplankton, due to the different delta(13)C Of marine and riverine dissolved inorganic carbon. Plankton use of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was tested with a 2-component model. The delta(13)C Of riverine DOC and the basin phytoplankton were taken to represent the allochthonous and autochthonous signals, respectively. Use of riverine DOC was indicated for larger zooplankton (200-2500 mu m) in the Bothnian Bay, confirming earlier suggestions of extensive use of riverine DOC in the zooplankton food webs in this basin. A new method to adjust delta(13)C in zooplankton for variations in lipid content by analysis of covariance was successfully demonstrated. The isotope data reflect the presence of 2 trophic structures, coinciding with the microheterotrophic food web (0.7-5 mu m) and the classic grazing food web (>50 mu m). From phytoplankton to large zooplankton, delta(15)N increased linearly with the logarithm of organism size in an basins. This increase was steeper in the Bothnian Sea and the Baltic Proper, where zooplankton diversity is higher, than in the Bothnian Bay, possibly reflecting more complex food-web interactions.

AB  - Mutualisms between fungi and fungus-growing animals are model systems for studying coevolution and complex interactions between species. Fungal growing behavior has enabled cultivating animals to rise to major ecological importance, but evolution of farming symbioses is thought to be restricted to three terrestrial insect lineages. Surveys along 2,000 km of North America's Atlantic coast documented that the marine snail Littoraria irrorata grazes fungus-infected wounds on live marsh grass throughout its range. Field experiments demonstrate a facultative, farming mutualism between Littoraria and intertidal fungi. Snails graze live grass primarily not to feed but to prepare substrate for fungal growth and consume invasive fungi. Fungal removal experiments show that snails and fungi act synergistically to suppress marsh grass production. These results provide a case of fungus farming in the marine environment and outside the class Insecta and reveal a previously undemonstrated ecological mechanism (i.e., facilitation of fungal invasion) by which grazers can exert top-down control of marine plant production.

AB  - In order to test the hypothesis that the ambient iron concentrations could regulate sulfate reducing activity (SRA) in mangrove areas, 10 cm cores were examined from test and reference sites. The test site at Diwar mangrove ecosystem is highly influenced by iron released by the movement of barges carrying iron ore during the non-monsoon seasons and the reference site at Tuvem is relatively pristine. The average iron concentrations were 17.9% (+/-8.06) at Diwar and 6.3% (+/-1.5) at Tuvem. Sulfate reducing rates (SRR) ranged from 50.21 to 698.66 nM cm(-3) d(-1) at Tuvem, and from 23.32 to 294.49 nM cm(-3) d(-1) in Diwar. Pearson's correlation coefficients between SRR and environmental parameters showed that at Tuvem, the SRR was controlled by SO(4)(-2) (r = 0.498, p < 0.001, n = 60) more than organic carbon (r = 0.316 p < 0.05, n = 60). At Diwar, the SRR was governed by the iron concentrations at an r-value of -0.761 (p < 0.001, n = 60), suggesting that ca.58% of the variation in SRR was influenced negatively by variations in ambient iron concentrations. This influence was more than the positive influence of TOC (r = 0.615, p < 0.001, n = 60). Laboratory experiments to check the influence of iron on SRR also supported our field observations. At an experimental manipulation of 50 ppm Fe(3+) there was an increase in SRR but at 100 ppm an inhibitory effect was observed. At 1000 ppm Fe(3+) there was a decrease in the SRR up to 93% of the control. Thus, our study showed that ambient iron concentrations influence SRR negatively at Diwar and counters the positive influence of organic carbon. Consequently, the influence could cascade to other biogeochemical processes in these mangrove swamps, especially the mineralization of organic matter to carbon dioxide by sulfate respiration.

AB  - Net ecosystem production (NEP) and the overall organic carbon budget for the estuaries along the East Coast of the United States are estimated. We focus on the open estuarine waters, excluding the fringing wetlands. We developed empirical models relating NEP to loading ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total organic carbon, and carbon burial in the sediment to estuarine water residence time and total nitrogen input across the landward boundary. Output from a data-constrained water quality model was used to estimate inputs of total nitrogen and organic carbon to the estuaries across the landward boundary, including fluvial and tidal-wetland sources. Organic carbon export from the estuaries to the continental shelf was computed by difference, assuming steady state. Uncertainties in the budget were estimated by allowing uncertainties in the supporting model relations. Collectively, U.S. East Coast estuaries are net heterotrophic, with the area-integrated NEP of -1.5 (-2.8, -1.0)TgCyr(-1) (best estimate and 95% confidence interval) and area-normalized NEP of -3.2 (-6.1, -2.3)molCm(-2)yr(-1). East Coast estuaries serve as a source of organic carbon to the shelf, exporting 3.4 (2.0, 4.3)TgCyr(-1) or 7.6 (4.4, 9.5)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources for the region are estimated at 5.4 (4.6, 6.5)TgCyr(-1) or 12 (10, 14)molCm(-2)yr(-1) and carbon burial in the open estuarine waters at 0.50 (0.33, 0.78)TgCyr(-1) or 1.1 (0.73, 1.7)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Our results highlight the importance of estuarine systems in the overall coastal budget of organic carbon, suggesting that in the aggregate, U.S. East Coast estuaries assimilate (via respiration and burial) similar to 40% of organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources and allow similar to 60% to be exported to the shelf.

AB  - There has been considerable discussion over the past several years about the potential negative effects of nutrient loading on coastal wetland stability. In particular, there have been concerns that high nitrate concentrations can fuel denitrification that can lead to soil organic matter loss and wetland deterioration. Here we review these issues for three case studies where there have been elevated levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, especially nitrate, coincident with wetland deterioration. These case studies include the Breton Sound estuary that receives diverted Mississippi River water at Caernarvon LA, a freshwater assimilation wetland that receives treated municipal effluent from a wastewater treatment plant at Hammond, LA, and a tidal creek in the Plum Island Sound estuary of northeastern Massachusetts where nitrate was introduced on each flood tide during the growing season for nearly ten years. We review the physical setting, ecology and biogeochemistry of these sites and use stoichiometric calculations to estimate how much soil organic matter decomposition could be accounted for by denitrification. Results of these calculations show that denitrification rates could not have caused the observed marsh deterioration at the two LA marshes. Denitrification may play a significant role in marsh loss at the MA site, however due to the unique hydrology of this site, denitrification rates induced by very high nitrogen loading rates in concert with the hydrology of the site may play a more significant role in marsh deterioration.

AB  - Despite extensive studies on how environmental factors influence plant nutrient distribution and stoichiometry, it remains unclear how elevation affects soil distribution and stoichiometry. Here, patterns of the spatial distribution and stoichiometry of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were studied (with 123 soil samples) along a small-scale elevation gradient in the wetland of East Dongting Lake, China. Plant nutrient concentrations (C, N and P), soil stoichiometry (C:N, C:P and N:P ratios) and their relations with other soil properties were analysed. In addition, the spatial distributions of plant nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry were evaluated geostatistically with regression kriging, entailing estimation of regression parameters by generalized least squares and ordinary kriging of the residuals. Soil C, N and P concentrations and stoichiometry had moderate to strong spatial dependence, and the ratios of C:P and N:P had similar patterns of distribution to soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN). The SOC, TN, C:N, C:P and N:P ratios increased with increasing elevation, whereas total phosphorus (TP) showed no marked change. Furthermore, SOC, TN, C:N, C:P and N:P decreased considerably with increasing duration of submergence, soil moisture and pH. Therefore, elevation appeared to influence the distribution of plant nutrients and stoichiometry as a result of changing soil moisture and duration of submergence. Highlights
   Study showed how elevation influences plant nutrient distribution and stoichiometry. Regression kriging was used to map soil properties. Plant nutrients and stoichiometry decreased with increasing duration of submergence. Elevation affected nutrient distribution because of soil moisture and water regime.

AB  - We studied the composition of the <25 mum seston size fraction as a food resource potentially available to suspension feeding ribbed mussels, Geukensia demissa, over an annual cycle in Canary Creek saltmarsh, Delaware Bay. There were significant seasonal variations in the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and total carbohydrate, but not cellulose. The concentration of cellulose, measured by hydrolytic cellulase enzyme assay, was relatively low (seasonal range 24 to 35 mugl(-1)) and only comprised from 3% of total carbohydrate in May 1996 to 13% in November 1995. We used the biomass of microalgae, estimated from chlorophyll a, and abundance of free-living bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates to calculate each component's equivalent carbon content. Microalgae were the most dominant carbon source (62% annually) among the four identified components (phytoplankton, bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and cellulose) in all seasons except in August 1995 when carbon from bacteria was most abundant (55%). The annual average carbon equivalents of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and cellulose were relatively small (2 and 4%, respectively). The total concentration of POC in the seston was much greater than the carbon derived from the four identified components. The proportions that these identified components contributed to POC varied seasonally and combined only accounted for 8-24% of POC. Based on these estimates, the bulk of the POC in Canary Creek marsh was not associated with any of the four components we identified. We suggest that this uncharacterized material was some type of non-lignocellulosic, amorphous detritus of unknown utility as a food resource for ribbed mussels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Denitrification (N2 production) and oxygen consumption rates were measured at ambient field nitrate concentrations during summer in sediments from eight wetlands (mixed hardwood swamps, cedar swamps, heath dominated shrub wetland, herbaceous peatland, and a wetland lacking live vegetation) and two streams. The study sites included wetlands in undisturbed watersheds and in watersheds with considerable agricultural and/or sewage treatment effluent input. Denitrification rates measured in intact cores of water-saturated sediment ranged from less-than-or-equal-to 20 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1 among the three undisturbed wetlands and were less variable (180 to 260 mumol N m-2 h-1) among the four disturbed wetlands. Denitrification rates increased when nitrate concentrations in the overlying water were increased experimentally (1 up to 770 muM), indicating that nitrate was an important factor controlling denitrification rates. However, rates of nitrate uptake from the overlying water were not a good predictor of denitrification rates because nitrification in the sediments also supplied nitrate for denitrification. Regardless of the dominant vegetation, pH, or degree of disturbance, denitrification rates were best correlated with sediment oxygen consumption rates (r2 = 0.912) indicating a relationship between denitrification and organic matter mineralization and/or sediment nitrification rates. Rates of denitrification in the wetland sediments were similar to those in adjacent stream sediments. Rates of denitrification in these wetlands were within the range of rates previously reported for water-saturated wetland sediments and flooded soils using whole core N-15 techniques that quantify coupled nitrification/denitrification, and were higher than rates reported from aerobic (non-saturated) wetland sediments using acetylene block methods.

AB  - We studied organic matter cycling in two Gulf Coast tidal, nonsaline marsh sites where subsidence causes intrusion and rapid submergence, which mimics increased sea-level rise. The sites experienced equally rapid submergence but different degrees of marine intrusion. Vegetation was hummocked and much of the marsh lacked rooted vegetation. Aboveground standing crop and production, as measured by sequential harvesting, were low relative to other Gulf Coast Spartina patens marshes. Soil bulk density was lower than reported for healthy S. alterniflora growth but that may be unimportant at the current, moderate sulfate levels. Belowground production, as measured by sequential harvesting, was extremely fast within hummocks, but much of the marsh received little or no belowground inputs. Aboveground production was slower at the more saline site (681 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than at the less saline site (1,252 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Belowground production over the entire marsh surface averaged 1,401 g m(-2) yr(-1) at the less saline site and 585 g m(-2) yr(-1) at the more saline site. Respiration, as measured by CO2 emissions in the field and corrected for CH4 emissions, was slower at the less saline site (956 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than at the more saline site (1,438 g m(-2) yr(-1)), reflecting greater contributions by S. alterniflora at the more saline site which is known to decompose more rapidly than S. patens. Burial of organic matter was faster at the less saline site (796 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than at the more saline site (434 g m(-2) yr(-1)) likely in response to faster production and slower decomposition at the less saline site. Thus vertical accretion was faster at the less saline site (1.3 cm yr(-1)) than at the more saline site (0.85 cm yr(-1)); slower vertical accretion increased flooding at the more saline site. More organic matter was available for export at the less saline site (1,377 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than at the more saline site (98 g;m(-2) yr(-1)). These data indicated that organic matter production decreased and burial increased in response to greenhouse-like conditions brought on by subsidence.

AB  - Introduction: Large stocks of ?blue carbon? exist in the ecosystems of coastal wetlands. This paper presents a case study of the Chinese city of Yancheng. First, through field surveys and laboratory analysis, changes in the organic carbon (OC) content in typical plant communities throughout the study area are described in detail. Second, an OC burial rate and economic value model is constructed to analyze the composition of the carbon sink values. Outcomes/other: The results are as follows: Of the typical plant communities, Spartina alterniflora has the highest OC content (5.80 g?kg-1), followed by Suaeda glauca (4.78 g?kg-1) and Phragmites australis (3.76 g?kg-1); the contemporary OC sedimentation rates are 2.01, 1.48, and 1.22 cm?yr-1, respectively. Spartina alterniflora communities have the highest annual average carbon sink value ($418.74/ha) in the study area, followed by Phragmites australis ($176.29/ha) and Suaeda glauca ($101.54/ha). Discussion: As a result of both the expansion of the Spartina alterniflora area and coastal erosion, the total OC value since 1987 has displayed two-stage characteristics: it first increased and then decreased. Conclusion: In recent years, the annual average decline in OC value has ranged from approximately $82,100 to $123,100 (reference: the Sweden carbon tax provided by the World Bank, 130$/ton)

AB  - The attenuation of the acid mine drainage is one of the most important environmental challenges facing the mining industry worldwide. Mining waste deposits from an ancient metallurgical extraction of heavy metals were found near to the San Antonio marsh in Patagonia. The aim of this work was to determinate which mechanisms regulate the mobilization and retention of metals by acid drainage. A geological and geomorphological survey was carried out and samples from the mining waste deposits and the marsh were collected to determine soil texture, Eh pH, organic matter, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe content, and soil mineralogical composition. Metals in marsh plants were determined in above-and below -ground structures. In the mining waste deposits polymetallic sulphides were recognized where the oxidation and formation of oxy-hydroxides and sulphates of Fe, Cu, Pb and Zn occurs. Then, by the alteration of those minerals, the metals enter in solution and are mobilized with the surface drainage towards the marsh where adsorption in the soils fine fraction and organic matter and/or by plants occurs. Locally, in the mining waste deposits, the precipitation/dissolution of Cu, Pb, and Zn sulphates take place in small centripetal drainage basins. In topographically lower portions of the marsh desorption and removal of metals by tidal flow could also be happen. The results allow to concluding that the marsh adjacent to the mining waste deposits is a geochemically active environment that naturally mitigates the contamination caused by acid drainage.

AB  - The rapid implementation of anaerobic digestion for renewable energy production has resulted in increased generation of anaerobically digested slurry, which contains a variety of pollutants and therefore has the potential to cause serious environmental problems. Tidal flow constructed wetlands, which could generate beneficial oxygen conditions, were investigated for their success in removing nitrogen, organic matter and pathogens in anaerobically digested slurry. The results indicated that tidal operation had a positive effect on promoting NH4+-N and organic matter (chemical oxygen demand (COD)) removal. With an average influent NH4+-N concentration of 288 mg/L and COD concentration of 839 mg/L, the average removal efficiency reached up to 93% (325 g/m(2) day) for NH4+-N and 53% (603 g/m(2) day) for COD, with total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal efficiency of 51% (226 g/m(2) day). The nitrogen removal in the tidal-operated CWs is highly dependent on the flooded and drained (F/D) time ratio. Changing flooded time from 3 to 5 h enhanced denitrification (nitrite reductase-K (nirK) abundance) and further resulted in improved TIN removal efficiency of 62% (237 g/m(2) day). The removal of faecal indicators was also examined, with reduction rate of approximately 0.9 log(10) CFU/100 mL for both Escherichia coli and total coliforms, which was independent of the influent loadings and differing flooded/drained time ratio. Tidal flow CWs were demonstrated to have the high potential to treat diluted anaerobically digested slurry.

AB  - In 2008, we studied contents of soil organic matters(SOM) and total sulfur(TS) in the surface and subsurface soils in nine typical sampling points that covered with different plant communities in the wetland of Yellow River Estuary in order to identify the influences of different plant communities. Results showed the contents of SOM varied in irregular "M" mode except for 0-10cm soil layer. The characteristics of vertical distribution were resemble of different sites in the whole, decreasing along with the depth though existing some waves. The diversity was remarkable (C.V. > 10%), showing as medium variability. For TS, contents decreased with plant communities succession. But the characteristics of vertical distribution was not very significant. Correlation analysis showed that SOM contents had significant correlation with TN contents(r=0.955, p<0.01), TP contents were closely linked with SOM and nitrogen contents, but TS contents had no remarkable correlation with any other element.

AB  - Purpose Humic acids (HA) have several environmental roles, but are particularly important in aquatic environments, being recognized as redox active natural organic matter (NOM) components. We examined NOM in recent sediments of a low-energy coastal environment which is free from inputs of dissolved terrestrial HA as their solubility is suppressed by bonding with Ca2+ ions. Our aim is to investigate the contribution of autochthonous versus terrestrial C sources to HA and their fractions along a river-coastal lagoon transect. Materials and methods Surface sediments were collected along the Aussa River (R), in the central basin of the Marano and Grado Lagoon (L) and within a secluded lagoon fish farm (FF). Extractable NOM components were obtained by extracting sediments first with 0.5 M NaOH (free NOM) and then with 0.1 M NaOH plus 0.1 M Na4P2O7 (bound NOM). Extracts were separated into non-humic and humic fractions by solid phase chromatography. Organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-tot), delta C-13, and delta N-15 were determined with an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage) coupled with an Elemental Analyzer (Costech Instruments Elemental Combustion System). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a FT-IR100 PerkinElmer Spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were recorded at pH 7 by a Varian Cary Spectrophotometer. Results and discussion Both NOM and HA display typical traits of terrestrial origin in river sediments and of a more marine (algal) origin in lagoon and fish farm sediments. This trend is evident in free HA, whereas bound HA seem more influenced by terrestrial inputs. A larger proportion (60-70%) of non-humic C was extracted by NaOH in all samples. Bound HA differ from free HA for their C/N ratios, which are higher and vary within a much narrower range. The changes in HA's C-13 isotopic composition, FTIR spectra, and spectroscopic parameters (SUVA(254), S-R, and aromaticity) highlight a progressive mixing of terrestrial and marine substrates that either undergo in situ humification or are transported as materials sorbed onto suspended mineral particles. Conclusions Our results highlight the existence of a complex, but continuous pattern of terrestrial and marine contributions to C sequestration and humification even in transitional environments where allochthonous humic C inputs are restricted due to insolubilization of humic substances by Ca2+. Along the examined transect, the NOM and free and bound HA appear well differentiated. Terrestrial inputs contribute to the bound HA fraction via transported mineral particles in all the samples, no matter the environment encountered.

AB  - Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) often accumulate in mangrove and seagrass sediments. As CaCO3 production emits CO2, there is concern that this may partially offset the role of Blue Carbon ecosystems as CO2 sinks through the burial of organic carbon (C-org). A global collection of data on inorganic carbon burial rates (C-inorg, 12% of CaCO3 mass) revealed global rates of 0.8 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) and 15-62 TgC(inorg) yr(-1) in mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. In seagrass, CaCO3 burial may correspond to an offset of 30% of the net CO2 sequestration. However, a mass balance assessment highlights that the C-inorg burial is mainly supported by inputs from adjacent ecosystems rather than by local calcification, and that Blue Carbon ecosystems are sites of net CaCO3 dissolution. Hence, CaCO3 burial in Blue Carbon ecosystems contribute to seabed elevation and therefore buffers sea-level rise, without undermining their role as CO2 sinks.

AB  - Volatile sulphur-containing compounds (VSC) are formed in large quantities in the gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract) of pigs and upon excretion from the animal; these compounds are released from the faeces causing emission of foul odour. However, very little is known about the rate and extent of their production or concentration along the GI-tract of the pig, and to what extent these parameters are influenced by the sulphur content of the diet. In order to address these questions, two diets with different sulphur content were formulated. Growing pigs were fed one of each diet during a minimum of three weeks after which they were killed and gas samples were removed from eight segments of the intact GI-tract and analysed for VSC, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. The concentration of individual VSC in gas samples from the intact GI-tract varied between segments. The total concentration of VSC was high in the cecum and throughout the colon. A significantly higher concentration of methanethiol in the stomach, cecum and proximal colon and of dimethyl sulphide in the cecum and along the colon of pigs fed the high-sulphur diet compared to those fed the low-sulphur diet was measured.

AB  - Recent studies in the southern Adriatic Sea have shown that dense water cascading is an effective off-shelf transport mechanism. In order to evaluate the relative importance of different processes affecting the down-slope transfer of organic matter (OM), a multi-proxy biogeochemical study was carried out in the southern Adriatic. Three sediment traps were deployed on the southern slope in March 2004 for 1 year at 35 m above the seabed. Surficial sediments were collected on the shelf and slope along a shore-normal transect. Suspended material in the water column at different water depths was collected along nine shore-normal transects. Organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13 and Delta C-14) and CuO reaction products were used to identify the OM sources and to asses the relative importance of vertical and lateral particulate fluxes. Both sinking particulates from the euphotic zone and advected material from the seafloor were collected by the moored instrumentations. During low-mass fluxes, the trapped material exhibited the highest Delta C-14 values (from -162.0 parts per thousand to +42.3 parts per thousand) and OC contents (from 1.13% to 2.17%) while the lignin displayed the lowest content (from 0.160 to 0.285 mg 100 mg(-1) OC). However, during dense water cascading events, the down-slope particulate flux showed different compositional features. In this period the trapped material displayed the most depleted Delta C-14 values (from -275.3 parts per thousand to -171.3 parts per thousand.), the lowest OC content (from 0.87% to 1.31%), and the highest lignin content (from 0.230 to 379 mg 100 mg(-1) OC). Holocene sea-level rise has drastically reduced sediment availability to the Bari canyon, and this in turn has affected the OC composition of the material funneled toward the deep Adriatic Sea. Parameters based on lignin CuO products suggest that the terrestrial material exported down the slope is very different from riverine inputs and inner shelf sediments. This indicates that neither river floods nor sediment resuspension from the inner shelf contributes directly to the down-slope flux. Rather, the material collected in the sediment traps exhibits an OM composition comparable to the surface sediments collected in the southern outer shelf. This correspondence suggests that resuspension of sediments by bottom currents in the southern outer shelf significantly contribute to down-slope OM transfer. Finally, the presence of lignin phenols in all cups indicates that lateral fluxes were constantly active on the slope throughout the deployment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - (1) A procedure and experimental apparatus are described that permit determination of oxygen and carbon-dioxide generation in nutrient cultures bathing roots of mature wetland plants. Roots ot five different species were isolated from the atmosphere so that the only significant route of gaseous transfer was through the plant itself. (2) At the level of the whole plant, and on a time scale of weeks, the net effect of wetland plants on the root environment was generally not to oxygenate it. Although plants transported large amounts of oxygen between shoots and roots, most of that oxygen was consumed before it reached the bulk solution. Oxygen content of solutions bathing the root systems typically remained at or below 31-mu-mol l-1. However. solutions were greatly enriched in carbon dioxide, containing c. 1-5 mmol l-1. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the plants transported large amounts of O2 to the roots but that most of the O2 was consumed by respiration within the plant or by microbes supported by carbon compounds derived from the plant. (3) Rates of oxygen generation within root zone solutions generally were well below 35-mu-mol O2 plant-1 day-1 for most experimental plants. Only Scirpus acutus generated oxygen in solution at rates as high as 58-mu-mol O2 plant-1 day-1 (4) Microscopic analysis of roots revealed a high proportion of cortical aerenchyma (40-48%) in 86-99% of the sampled lengths of primary roots.

AB  - Wetlands can potentially sequester vast amounts of carbon. However, over 50% of wetlands globally have been degraded or lost. Restoration of wetland systems may therefore result in increased sequestration of carbon. Preliminary results of our investigations into atmospheric carbon sequestration by restored coastal wetlands indicate that carbon can be sequestered in substantial quantities in the first 2-50 years after restoration of natural hydrology and sediment accretion processes.

AB  - Fuyuan county, located to the north-east of the Sanjiang Plain but excluding the Muling-Xingkai Plain to the south of the Wanda Mountain, northeastern Heilongjiang province (China), has seen rapid change to the marsh and its agriculture. In 1982, 16.9% of the county was marshland and only 0.7% was dedicated to paddy fields. By 2005, 12.9% was marshland and 7.7% was paddy field. During this period, the agricultural population in the county rose from 28.5x10(3) to 79.4x10(3), and the numbers of households from 3.7x10(3) to 26.1x10(3). At the same time, the price of paddy and the productivity of paddies also increased. All these pressures combined to drive substantial changes to the marsh and paddy field. This paper considers the loss of the marsh ecosystem in terms of its total value and value per unit area, and assesses the overall benefits to people from the changes in paddy production. The authors also identify the total lost value of carbon formerly sequestered in the marsh compared with the net agricultural gains. Carbon sequestration lost a value of 55.50x10(6) Chinese Yuan (CNY; 100 CNY was equivalent to roughly US$12 in 2005), which was considerably less than the value of products (272.42x10(6)CNY) returned from the paddy fields. In terms of the benefits to society, the marsh created between 210.8x10(6) and 266.3x10(6) CNY, though the commercial/private benefits of the paddy field outweighed the benefits to society due to the fact that they are real while the societal benefits (although also real) have a monetary compensation that is hypothetical. Value per unit area of paddy field was much higher than that of the marsh except in 1982, before the people began to pursue more profitable private activities. Understanding the societal trade-offs between the contributions of a wetland ecosystem and agricultural expansion is a key ingredient in successful ecosystem management.

AB  - This study demonstrates the advantage of a combined use of chemical and isotopic tools to understand the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) cycle in a regional confined methanogenic aquifer. DOC concentration and carbon isotopic data demonstrate that the soil zone is a primary carbon source of groundwater DOC in areas close to recharge zones. An in-situ DOC source linked to organic rich sediments present in the aquifer matrix is controlling the DOC pool in the central part of the groundwater flow system. DOC fractions, C-13-NMR on fulvic acids and C-14 data on DOC and CH4 support the hypothesis that the in-situ DOC source is a terrestrial organic matter and discard the Ordovician bedrock as a source of DOC.
