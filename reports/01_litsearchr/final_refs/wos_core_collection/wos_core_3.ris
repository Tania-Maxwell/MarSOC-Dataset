AB  - The relative importance of carbon sources supporting aquatic food webs within and among estuaries may be influenced by factors that affect relative availability of autotrophic carbon sources, as well as movement of individuals among marine, estuarine and freshwater zones. We used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine (1) the relative importance of carbon sources supporting estuarine consumers among estuaries with different hydrogeomorphic characteristics, (2) stable isotope signatures of consumer ecological guilds defined by dependence on estuarine habitats and residence time, and (3) if patterns in stable isotope signatures of ecological guilds repeat across estuaries with distinct hydrogeomorphological features. At the assemblage level, consumer carbon isotope signatures reflected the consumption of locally abundant primary production sources and differed across estuary types (choked lagoon, coastal river). Consumer ecological guilds differed in delta C-13 within sites, and the same trend repeated across sites but with differing magnitudes. This variation is attributed to movement and residence patterns in addition to differences in the relative abundances of autotrophic sources across sites. Although within-estuary variation in consumer resource use is to be expected, estuarine food webs may be broadly classified according to landscape-scale hydrogeomorphic factors that allow an initial prediction of the relative importance of carbon sources to secondary production. Predictions may be refined at the species level using knowledge of habitat use and residence time. Such predictions are useful as a starting point for poorly studied regions such as ours in southern Brazil, as well as for global-scale analyses of patterns in estuarine food webs.

AB  - The tidal freshwater marshes dominated by Phragmites australis (common reed) in the Chongxi Wetland are important components of the Yangtze River estuary in China. The litter from P. australis is exported to the surrounding estuarine area and the sea with the tidal flushing in the form of plant residue, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter and is an important organic carbon resource of the East China Sea. A model was constructed using STELLA((R)) software (version 9.1.3) to simulate the contribution of macrophyte-derived organic carbon to surrounding estuary and ocean ecosystems. The model is based on the monitoring and observational data from field surveys and published information on the Chongxi Wetland from 2008 to 2011, and the response of the total organic carbon flowing out of the wetland to global changes was also predicted in conditions of plant shoots that were annually harvested in winter. The results demonstrate the following: (1) the annual contributed organic carbon is 891gCm(-2), of which 612gCm(-2) flows out of the wetland directly as plant residue; (2) total organic carbon continually increases after a short decrease at the start of April of 2010, retains a high value from mid-July to mid-November and rapidly decreases to approximately zero during the harvest of the aboveground plant organs; and (3) accumulated annual organic carbon contributions to the surrounding estuarine and oceanic ecosystems are predicted to increase as the global average temperature rises, and the sea level increases.

AB  - Delta wetland sediments constitute a long-term natural carbon sink and play a critical role in the global carbon cycle. In this study, borehole core ZK3 (36.7-m long), drilled in 2012 in the Liaohe Delta wetland, was investigated to assess the rate of carbon sequestration and the factors influencing carbon burial since the Late Pleistocene. Here we report the results of integrated analyses of the core, including its sedimentary lithology, grain size, foraminiferal abundance, chemical elements, and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. The sedimentary environment has evolved from a fluvial-deposit, limnetic-deposit, littoral-deposit, shallow sea deposit, and finally to a delta-deposit environment since 40,000 cal yr BP. Environmentally induced differences in apparent mass accumulation rates (AMARs) of organic carbon (OC) have been significant; they have ranged between 3.73 and 30.77 g/(m(2)yr). The fact that the highest rates were associated with the delta-deposit environment indicates that the rate of carbon sequestration was greater in the sediments of estuarine wetlands than sediments of the continental shelf. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) proxy responded to several cold events, and there was a positive correlation between the CIA and OC-AMAR. Climate may therefore have regulated the excursions of ecosystem productions and in turn impacted the dynamics of carbon burial.

AB  - The Southern North Sea coast has served as an exemplification to analyse and discuss the genesis of soils from Holocene tidal deposits. The accumulation wedge of Holocene tidal deposits at the North Sea coast is artificially embanked for the most part. In the enclosed area (hinterland) a variety of different soils developed. Disparate models attempting to explain the genesis of these soils deduce genesis of hinterland soils from recent foreland conditions, disregarding that geogenic preconditions have fundamentally changed. By consolidating and reviewing established literature we show that differences in geogenic preconditions are the initiating key for a feasible model. Describing geogenic preconditions to infer pedogenic processes, we develop a model comprising four different development pathways. High settling velocities and regular flooding, as present in the foreland, cause high inputs of mineral sediments and carbonate, moderate sulfur dynamics and thus the development of calcareous soils. Synsedimentary decalcification prevails in irregularly flooded areas due to enduring low sedimentation rates, low carbonate inputs and moderate sulfur dynamics under alternating redox states, as mainly proposed for the unobstructed landscape. High contents of soil organic matter (SOM) facilitate intensive sulfur dynamics creating potential acid sulfate soils (PASS), which become extreme acid upon oxidation (actual acid sulfate soils (AASS)). A great gradient in depositional conditions, occurring at unobstructed plain coasts, enables the deposition of deflocculated fine-grained sediments which promotes the formation of very compact soils with low water conductivities. Although this proposed model is based mainly on conditions known from the German North Sea coast, it is shown that shaping geogenic and pedogenic processes are applicable to other humid coastal regions around the world.

AB  - Soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and stoichiometries can be used to evaluate the success indicators to the effects of wetland restoration and reflect ecosystem function. Restoration of inland soda saline-alkali wetlands is widespread, however, the soil nutrition changes that follow restoration are unclear. We quantified the recovery trajectories of soil physicochemical properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) pools, for a chronosequence of three restored wetlands (7 yr, 12 yr and 21 yr) and compared these properties to those of degraded and natural wetlands in the western Songnen Plain, Northeast China. Wetland degradation lead to the loss of soil nutrients. Relative to natural wetlands, the mean reductions of in SOC, TN, and TP concentrations were 89.6%, 65.5% and 52.5%, respectively. Nutrients recovered as years passed after restoration. The SOC, TN, and TP concentrations increased by 2.36 times, 1.15 times, and 0.83 times, respectively in degraded wetlands that had been restored for 21 yr, but remained 29.2%, 17.3%, and 12.8% lower, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C:N (R-CN), C:P (R-CP), and N:P (R-NP) ratios increased from 5.92 to 8.81, 45.36 to 79.19, and 7.67 to 8.71, respectively in the wetland that had been restored for 12 yr. These results were similar to those from the natural wetland and the wetland that had been restored for 21 yr (P > 0.05). Soil nutrients changes occurred mainly in the upper layers (<= 30 cm), and no significant differences were found in deeper soils (> 30 cm). Based on this, we inferred that it would take at least 34 yr for SOC, TN, and TP concentrations and 12 yr for R-CN, R-CP, and R-NP in the top soils of degraded wetlands to recover to levels of natural wetlands. Soil salinity negatively influenced SOC (r =.0.704, P < 0.01), TN (r =.0.722, P < 0.01), and TP (r =.0.882, P < 0.01) concentrations during wetland restoration, which indicates that reducing salinity is beneficial to SOC, TN, and TP recovery. Moreover, plants were an important source of soil nutrients and vegetation restoration was conducive to soil nutrient accumulation. In brief, wetland restoration increased the accumulation of soil biogenic elements, which indicated that positive ecosystem functions changes had occurred.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are ecosystems that provide multiple benefits to human settlements; nonetheless, they are seriously threatened due to both a lack of planning instruments and human activities associated mainly with urban growth. An understanding of their functioning and status is crucial for their protection and conservation. Two wetlands with different degrees of urbanization, Rocuant-Andalien (highly urbanized) and Tubul-Raqui (with little urbanization), were analyzed using temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, granulometry, fecal coliform, and macroinvertebrate assemblage variables in summer and winter. In both wetlands marked seasonality in salinity, temperature and sediment texture classification, regulated by oceanic influence and changes in the freshwater budget, was observed. In the Rocuant-Andalien wetland, the increases in pH, dissolved oxygen, gravel percentage, and coliform concentration were statistically significant. Urbanization generated negative impacts on macroinvertebrate assemblage structure that inhabit the wetlands; greater richness and abundance (8.5 times greater) were recorded in the Tubul-Raqui wetland than in the more urbanized wetland. The multivariate statistical analysis reflects the alteration of these complex systems.

AB  - The maintenance of marsh platform elevation under conditions of sea level rise is dependent on mineral sediment supply to marsh surfaces and conversion of above-and belowground plant biomass to soil organic material. These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here, we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to aboveground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, aboveground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary, USA. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important tradeoff with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, aboveground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of belowground biomass as the root : shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation.

AB  - Microbial respiration in peat and overlying plant litter, as influenced by water level and phosphorus; enrichment, was evaluated for an Everglades (Florida, USA) marsh ecosystem by measuring CO2 and CH4 release from soil-water microcosms. intact cores of peat, overlying plant litter, and surface water were collected at. seven locations in cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.) and sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) stands along a phosphorus (P) enrichment gradient in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A). Each soil-water. microcosm was outfitted with a controlled Air circulation system whereby outflow gas-from the headspace could be analyzed for CO2 and CH4 to determine flux of C from the soil-Water column to the atmosphere. Gaseous C flux was determined for flooded conditions (10-cm water depth) and for water levels. of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm. below the peat surface. Overall, decreasing water level resulted in significantly increased C flux, although rates were significantly higher under flooded conditions than under nonflooded, saturated-soil conditions, presumably due to O-2 availability associated with algal photosyntions, within the litter layer in the water column. Carbon flux decrease significantly for sites increasingly distant from the primary hydrologic and nutrient inflows to WCA-2A. The microcosm study demonstrated that the C turnover rate was significantly increased by accelerated nutrient loading to the marsh, and was further enhanced by decreasing Water level under drained conditions. Our -results also demonstrated that photosynthesis within the water column is a poteniially important regulator of C mineralization rate.in the litter layer

AB  - The vascular plant community in a freshwater tidal wetland on the lower Connecticut River was studied in 2000. The effects of abiotic conditions on density and species density of plants in 70 samples, each 0.25 m(2) in area, were characterized. Sixty species were recorded. The mean species density was highest in shallow water because the number of emergent species in the community was far greater than the number of submerged species, which occurred with higher frequency in deeper water. Plant density had a bimodal distribution because of the different responses of emergent and submerged plants to water depth and was lowest in shallow water, where physiological stress, physical disturbance, and possibly herbivory are suspected of being limiting. Ordination and regression analyses found that water depth and the amount of organic matter and nitrogen in the sediment had the greatest effect on wetland plant density, although other variables also were influential. Abundance of emergent and submerged species differed in their responses to ammonium and nitrate levels. Overall species density was most strongly correlated with water depth. Several plant associations, including associations of submerged and emergent species, were identified, based on shared affinities for environmental conditions.

AB  - This study examines long-term burial rates of organic carbon (OC), organic nitrogen (ON), and total sulphur (TS) in a tidal-dominated coastal wetland with a high spatial heterogeneity and habitat diversity, and long history of human impacts, Cadiz Bay (SW Spain). Using replicate sediment cores, we quantified fluxes of these elements over a transect, extending from the lower saltmarsh (Spartina maritima, similar to 0.3 m mean sea level, MSL) to the lower intertidal region (Zostera noltei, similar to - 0.7 m MSL). Potential organic matter (OM) sources to the sediment were examined using an extensive dataset on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, and C:N molar ratios of primary producers in the region. OC burial rates decreased from the sites below MSL (similar to 80 gC.m(-2).y(-1)) to the lower saltmarsh (similar to 50 gC.m(-2).y(-1)), whereas ON burial rates showed an opposite pattern (similar to 3 gN.m(-2).y(-1) and similar to 4 gN.m(-2).y(-1) observed below and above MSL, respectively). TS burial rates (0.5-46 gS.m(-2).y(-1)) did not show any trend along the sea-land gradient. Hence, (tidal) elevation appeared to be an important determinant of sediment biogeochemical properties, and predictor of OM burial rates. The Bayesian mixing model suggested a well-mixed combination of subtidal and terrestrial/high-marsh OM sources to the surface sediments, with no clear indication of an increased contribution from the particular vegetation species inhabiting the sediments. The indication that there is substantial transport, remineralization and cycling of OM between habitats, suggests diversity may play an important role in maintaining this function, reinforcing the idea that a holistic, catchment-scale view is appropriate for understanding and preserving the long-term burial of OM in coastal wetlands.

AB  - The rapid invasion of the plant Spartina alterniflora in coastal wetland areas can threaten the capacity of their soils to store carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S). In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of C, N and S of both soil and (native and invasive) plants in four typical coastal wetlands in the core area of the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The results show that the invasive S. alterniflora greatly influenced soil properties and increased soil C, N and S storage capacity: the stock (mean +/- standard error) of soil organic carbon (SOC, (3.56 +/- 0.36) kg/m(3)), total nitrogen (TN, (0.43 +/- 0.02) kg/m(3)), and total sulfur (TS, (0.69 +/- 0.11) kg/m(3)) in the S. alterniflora marsh exceeded those in the adjacent bare mudflat, Suaeda salsa marsh, and Phragmites australis marsh. Because of its greater biomass, plant C ((1193.7 +/- 133.6) g/m(2)), N ((18.8 +/- 2.4) g/m(2)), and S ((9.4 +/- 1.5) g/m(2)) storage of S. alterniflora was also larger than those of co-occurring native plants. More biogenic elements circulated in the soil-plant system of the S. alterniflora marsh, and their spatial and temporal distribution patterns were also changed by the S. alterniflora invasion. Soil properties changed by S. alterniflora's invasion thereby indirectly affected the accumulation of soil C, N and S in this wetland ecosystem. The SOC, TN, and TS contents were positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and moisture, but negatively correlated with the pH and bulk density of soil. Together, these results indicate that S. alterniflora invasion altered ecosystem processes, resulted in changes in net primary production and litter decomposition, and increased the soil C, N and S storage capacity in the invaded ecosystems in comparison to those with native tallgrass communities in the coastal wetlands of East China.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in soils is often characterized by the presence of resource-enriched patches ranging in size from a single shrub to wooded thickets. If the patches persist long enough, the primary constraint on production may transition from one limiting environmental factor to another. Tree islands that are scattered throughout the Florida Everglades basin comprise nutrient-enriched patches, or resource islands, in P-limited oligotrophic marshes. We used principal component analysis and multiple regressions to characterize the belowground environment (soil, hydrology) of one type of tree island, hardwood hammocks, and examined its relationship with the three structural variables (basal area, biomass, and canopy height) indicative of site productivity. Hardwood hammocks in the southern Everglades grow on two distinct soil types. The first, consisting of shallow, organic, relatively low-P soils, is common in the seasonally flooded Marl Prairie landscape. In contrast, hammocks on islands embedded in long hydroperiod marsh have deeper, alkaline, mineral soils with extremely high P concentrations. However, this edaphic variation does not translate simply into differences in forest structure and production. Relative water depth was unrelated to all measures of forest structure and so was soil P, but the non-carbonate component of the mineral soil fraction exhibited a strong positive relationship with canopy height. The development of P-enriched forest resource islands in the Everglades marsh is accompanied by the buildup of a mineral soil; however, limitations on growth in mature islands appear to differ substantively from those that dominate incipient stages in the transformation from marsh to forest.

AB  - The southern-most reproducing Longfin Smelt population occurs in the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA. Long-term monitoring of estuarine habitat for this species has generally only considered deep channels, with little known of the role shallow waters play in supporting their early life stage. To address the need for focused research on shallow-water habitat, a targeted study of Longfin Smelt larvae in littoral habitat was conducted to identify potential rearing habitats during 2013 and 2014. Our study objectives were to (1) determine if larval densities vary between littoral habitats (tidal slough vs. open-water shoal), (2) determine how larval densities in littoral habitats vary with physicochemical and biological attributes, (3) determine if larval densities vary between littoral habitats and long-term monitoring channel collections, and (4) determine what factors predict larval rearing distributions from the long-term monitoring channel collections. Larval densities did not vary between littoral habitats but they did vary between years. Water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a were found important in predicting larval densities in littoral habitats. Larval densities do not vary between littoral and channel surveys; however, the analysis based on channel data suggests that Longfin Smelt are hatching and rearing in a much broader region and under higher salinities (similar to 2-12 psu) than previously recognized. Results of this study indicate that conservation efforts should consider how freshwater flow, habitat, climate, and food webs interact as mechanisms that influence Longfin Smelt recruitment in estuarine environments.

AB  - This study analyzed the variations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) with depth in coastal wetlands of Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea. Generally, average contents of SOC and TN were higher at tidal flooding Guangrao wetland (GRA) than those at Changyi (CY) wetland where the tidal can rarely reached. Among the five profiles, higher variations of SOC and TN were observed in CYB1 and CYB2, where the TP contents showed lower variations. SOC showed a rapid decrease with depth in CYB1 and CYB2, whereas they tended to increase with depth in GRA1 and GRA2. Vertical distributions of TN were significantly correlated with SOC in profile GRA1, CYB1, and CYB2. However, no clear trend was found on the vertical variations of TP. Additionally, C, N, and P ecological stoichiometry in these two coastal wetlands had high complexities within wetland. The C/N ratios were generally higher, while the C/P ratios and the N/P ratios were comparatively low, indicating the coastal wetland biogeochemical processes were more limited by N and P, with the former may being the primary factor. Our results also indicated that both vegetation coverage and tidal flooding were important in the biogeochemical processes of these coastal wetlands.

AB  - Plant biomass and its allocation patterns are instrumental in understanding global carbon sinks; however, knowledge is still limited, especially in high-altitude peatlands. We investigated aboveground and belowground biomass allocation in the Zoige peatland of the Tibetan plateau, China, and its relationship with environmental factors using data collected from 32 sites across the peatland during 2011 and 2012. Standardized major axis, multiple factor analysis and linear regression functions were used to perform data analysis. The average aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, total biomass and root: shoot ratio for the Zoige alpine peatland were 341.01, 3262.93, 3620.36 g m(-2) and 10.32, respectively. On average, approximately 86% of the root biomass was located in the top 30 cm of soil. There was positive allometric relationship (p < 0.01) between belowground biomass and aboveground biomass. The water conditions, soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen were the main factors that influenced plant biomass and biomass allocation in the Zoige peatland.

AB  - Laboratory experiments and field measurements were conducted to examine the effect of tide on the organic carbon mineralization rate in sediments under aerobic conditions of an intertidal estuary. Core samples of surface sediments were collected from an intertidal estuary of the Kurose River, Hiroshima, Japan. To mimic low and high tide in the intertidal estuary, organic carbon mineralization rates in the samples were measured in the laboratory under both air-exposed and submerged conditions. Mineralization rates under air-exposed conditions were two to five times higher than those under submerged conditions. Field measurements of the rate of CO(2) emission from the sediment surface revealed a rapid increase in the rate as the sea level fell during ebb tide. The estimated amount of daily organic carbon mineralization assuming a constantly submerged condition was 30% less than that estimated when considering the semi-diurnal fluctuation in sea level. These results indicate that tide has a marked impact on the organic carbon mineralization rate in sediments under aerobic conditions on an intertidal estuary, and tidal effects need to be considered when the amount of mineralized organic carbon is estimated.

AB  - The BIT index represents the relative abundances of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) and the isoprenoid GDGT, crenarchaeol. While bGDGTs are produced mainly by soil (anaerobic) bacteria, crenarchaeol is known to be a biomarker for aerobic ammonia oxidation by chemolithoauto-trophic Thaumarchaeota, particularly in the open ocean or lakes. Thus, the index in marine and lacustrine settings has been widely used as a proxy for soil input. Here, we have investigated GDGT distribution along two transects extending from the lake shore marsh to upland soils on the NE Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The results show that soil water content (SWC) correlates positively with concentration of bGDGTs and negatively with concentration of crenarchaeol; consequently, there is a significant positive correlation between SWC and the BIT index. Our study highlights a new potential application of BIT as a humidity proxy in loess/soil and peat deposits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, and lots of them are invaded by Spartina alterniflora across different climate zones. We chose Jiuduansha wetland as a typical wetland ecosystem with minimal human activities to study the impacts and interactions between S. alterniflora invasion, soil functional microorganisms, and GHGs emission. Our findings indicated that in comparison to the mudflat and S. mariqueter habitat, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which was highly positively related to aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and the ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) concentration, but negatively related to the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration. The relative abundances of soil C-decomposing bacteria increased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with S. mariqueter habitat. Compared with the P. australis habitat, S. alterniflora invasion reduced soil CO2 emission, which was negatively related to salinity. The relative abundances of soil C-fixing bacteria (phylum Chloroflexi) and functional genes (acsA-F and rbcL) decreased in S. alterniflora habitat. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion increased soil methane (CH4) emission compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats, which was positively related to aboveground biomass, SOC and NH4+-N concentration, and negatively related to the NO3--N concentration. Besides, the relative abundances of CH4 oxidation functional genes were decreased in S. alterniflora habitat compared with the S. mariqueter and P. australis habitats. Meanwhile, the oxidation of CH4 to methanol was mainly regulated by mmoX gene at our study site. Thus, the soil CO2 and CH4 emissions after S. alterniflora invasion were regulated by soil environmental factors and soil C-fixing, C-decomposing, and CH4 oxidation functional microorganisms. Our results are helpful to better understand the mechanisms involved in the impacts of S. alterniflora invasions on GHG emissions in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Delta wetlands are increasingly recognized as important sinks for 'blue carbon,' although this and other ecosystem services that deltas provide are threatened by human activities. We investigated factors that affect sediment accretion using short term (3 years using marker horizons) and longer-term measures (similar to 50 year using Cs-137 soil core distribution and similar to 100 year using Pb-210 distribution), the associated carbon accumulation rates, and resulting changes in surface elevation in the Ebro River Delta, Catalonia, Spain. Fifteen sites were selected, representing the geomorphological settings and range of salinities typical of the delta's wetlands. Sediment accretion rates as measured by Cs-137 distribution in soil cores ranged from 0.13 to 0.93 cm yr(-1). Surface elevations increased at all sites, from 0.10 to 2.13 cm yr(-1) with the greatest increases in natural impoundments with little connection to other surface waters. Carbon accumulation rates were highly spatially variable, ranging from 32 to 435 g C m(-1) yr(-1) with significantly higher rates at bay sites (p = 0.02) where hydrologic connectivity is high and sediment resuspension more intense. Sites with high connectivity had significantly higher rates of carbon accumulation (averaging 376 +/- 50 g C m(-1) yr(-1)) compared to sites with moderate or low connectivity. We also found high rates of carbon accumulation in brackish sites where connectivity was low and biomass production was characteristically higher than in saline sites. A stepwise regression model explained 81% of variability in carbon accumulation rates across all sites. Our data indicate deltaic wetlands can be important sinks for blue carbon, contributing to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Fatty acid profiles of food sources, dominant zooplankton, macrofauna and a few small ichthyofauna in a temperate estuary on the southeastern coast of South Africa were used to trace the original carbon sources and the degree of feeding plasticity of consumers within an oligotrophic environment. Fatty acid analysis is seldom used to examine food web ecology in estuaries, as these systems are typically highly complex owing to the variety of potential food sources and the variable nature of detritus. We hypothesized that generalist consumers would exhibit similar and overlapping fatty acid compositions, whereas any specialist consumers would 'stand out' as they may contain high proportions of fatty acids specific to their preferred food sources. Within-species variation was very small in the food sources, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allowed resolution of most species and sample types into distinct clusters. Variation of fatty acid composition was greater within the consumers, with PCA resolving several clusters by collection location within the site and feeding mode of the animals (suspension feeders, grazers and omnivores). We considered the fatty acid profiles (with particular reference to polyunsaturated fatty acids and essential fatty acids) of the consumers in relation to the food sources to determine which organisms played significant roles in the sequestration and cycling of high quality organic material within the estuary.

AB  - The major gases contributing to the greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide and methane (60 and 15-18%, respectively). The former Soviet Union area accounts for 11% of the global methane flux on the average. However, virtually no records of methane flux were kept in Russia in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Inventories of methane emission in Russia were reported in the middle 1990s, but those data were confined to measurements performed by the early 1990s. This paper presents generalized data on methane and carbon dioxide emission from the surfaces of marsh ecosystems in West Siberia in the 1990s, when the majority of measurements were carried out.

AB  - Background The lateral movements of mass and energy across the terrestrial-aquatic interface are being increasingly recognized for their importance in the carbon (C) balance of coastal/estuarine wetlands. We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.

AB  - Coastal wetlands in Louisiana experience high rates of edge erosion due to combined eustatic sea level rise and coastal subsidence. This study sought to (1) evaluate site-specific spatial and temporal patterns in marsh edge erosion rates within Barataria Bay, LA, (2) develop an understanding of the physical and chemical properties of eroding soils through biogeochemical and spectroscopic characterization, and (3) evaluate interactions between erosion, saltwater incursion, and soil properties through a comparison of sites with different erosion rates and varying distances from the eroding edge. Replicate soil cores were collected at three distances inland (1 m, 3 m, 5 m) at three different sites (west, south, and north) to a depth of 1 m. Erosion rates were measured at each site, and soils were sectioned into 10 cm intervals for a total of 270 soil and porewater samples. Each soil sample was subjected to soil physicochemical analysis (bulk density, moisture content, organic matter content, and total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)) as well as assessments of biogeochemical cycling (production of CO2, mineralization of N and P, and extractable nutrient concentrations). Porewater samples were analyzed to elucidate spectroscopic and fluorometric indicators of carbon quality (aromaticity, humification, lignin proportion, and C source). Erosion rates at the west, north, and south sites were 3.36 +/- 0.4, 1.34 +/- 0.2, and 038 +/- 0.03 m yr(-1), respectively. Neither erosional magnitude nor saltwater incursion was found to be significant predictors of any measured spectroscopic or biogeochemical parameters, though depth was a significant control on 18 of the measured 20 parameters. The top 30 cm were more biologically active (as indicated by greater mineralization of C, N and P) and were characterized by lower molecular weight porewater DOM with less aromaticity. Degree of humification and aromaticity of porewater DOM increased with both depth and distance inland. Concentrations of bioavailable N and P at 1 m depth were at least 5 times greater than surface concentrations, representing a pool of nutrients that could be exported into the coastal ocean with ongoing erosion. This study is the first to couple spectroscopic and biogeochemical measurements for the purpose of assessing soil and porewater physicochemistry within wetland soils and illustrates an as-yet unaccounted for potential for the export of labile C, N, and P into the coastal ocean.

AB  - Separating the two major components of soil respiration, root respiration (Rr) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), is an important step for understanding and modelling carbon cycling in organic soils. However, few partitioning studies exist regarding wetland ecosystems. For this study, we selected a freshwater marsh on Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China and used a trenching method to determine the contribution of R-r to soil respiration during the two growing seasons in 2010 and 2011. The decomposition rate of dead roots (R-D) was estimated to correct the soil respiration of the trenching plots. The soil respiration rates in the control plot increased from May (288-508 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) to late June (1103 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 2010) or early July (1278 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 2011) and later decreased during the last growing season. The soil respiration rate in the trenching plot exhibited a similar pattern of seasonal change, but the rates were lower than in the control plot, except at the beginning of trenching. When considering the dead root decomposition in the trenching plots, the contributions of R-r to total soil respiration in the two growing seasons were estimated to range from 22 to 77 % (2010) and 46 to 81 % (2011). The mean contribution of R-D was approximately 12 % in the growing season of the first year (2010) and later decreased to approximately 6 % in the second year (2011). The contents of soil NH4+-N and NO3--N were significantly greater in the trenching plots than in the control plots. The content of microbial biomass nitrogen tended to increase after trenching for the 0- to 30-cm soil depth. These results indicate that the microbial community may change in the second year, which may affect the estimation of the contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts of Saudi Arabia thrive in an extremely arid and oligotrophic environment, with high seawater temperatures and salinity. Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on Pb-210 and for the last millennia based on C-14) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m(-2) in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m(-2) in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm(-2) yr(-1) in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm(-2) yr(-1) in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.

AB  - Abiotic global change factors, such as rising atmospheric CO2, and biotic factors, such as exotic plant invasion, interact to alter the function of terrestrial ecosystems. An invasive lineage of the common reed, Phragmites australis, was introduced to North America over a century ago, but the belowground mechanisms underlying Phragmites invasion and persistence in natural systems remain poorly studied. For instance, Phragmites has a nitrogen (N) demand higher than native plant communities in many of the ecosystems it invades, but the source of the additional N is not clear. We exposed introduced Phragmites and native plant assemblages, containing Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus, to factorial treatments of CO2 (ambient or +300 ppm), N (0 or 25 g m(-2) year(-1)), and hydroperiod (4 levels), and focused our analysis on changes in root productivity as a function of depth and evaluated the effects of introduced Phragmites on soil organic matter mineralization. We report that non-native invasive Phragmites exhibited a deeper rooting profile than native marsh species under all experimental treatments, and also enhanced soil organic matter decomposition. Moreover, exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 induced a sharp increase in deep root production in the invasive plant. We propose that niche separation accomplished through deeper rooting profiles circumvents nutrient competition where native species have relatively shallow root depth distributions; deep roots provide access to nutrient-rich porewater; and deep roots further increase nutrient availability by enhancing soil organic matter decomposition. We expect that rising CO2 will magnify these effects in deep-rooting invasive plants that compete using a tree-like strategy against native herbaceous plants, promoting establishment and invasion through niche separation.

AB  - The mechanism and environmental controls on soil hydrogen (H-2) uptake are not well understood but are essential for understanding the atmospheric H-2 budget. Field observations of soil H-2 uptake are limited, and here we present the results from a series of measurements in forest, desert, and marsh ecosystems in southern California. We measured soil H-2 fluxes using flux chambers from September 2004 to July 2005. Mean H-2 flux rates and standard deviations were -7.9 + -4.2, -7.6 + -5.3 and -7.5 + -3.4 nmol m(-2) s(-1) for the forest, desert, and marsh, respectively ( corresponding to deposition velocities of 0.063 + -0.029, 0.051 + -0.036, 0.035 + -0.013 cm s(-1)). Soil profile measurements showed that H-2 mixing ratios were between 3% and 51% of atmospheric levels at 10 cm and that the penetration of H-2 into deeper soil layers increased with soil drying. Soil removal experiments in the forest demonstrated that the litter layer did not actively consume H-2, the removal of this layer increased uptake by deeper soil layers, and the exposure of subsurface soil layers to ambient atmospheric H-2 levels substantially increased their rate of uptake. Similar soil removal experiments at the desert site showed that extremely dry surface soils did not consume H-2 and that fluxes at the surface increased when these inactive layers were removed. We present a model of soil H-2 fluxes and show that the diffusivity of soils, along with the vertical distribution of layers that actively consume H-2 regulate surface fluxes. We found that soil organic matter, CO2 fluxes, and ecosystem type were not strong controllers of H-2 uptake. Our experiments highlight H-2 diffusion into soils as an important limit on fluxes and that minimum moisture level is needed to initiate microbial uptake.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

AB  - Rates of bacterial production were measured in the water column, on the surface of plant detritus, and in the surface sediments of a freshwater marsh in the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, USA. Bacterioplankton production rates were not correlated with several measures of quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter, including an index of the relative importance of vascular plant derivatives. Bacterioplankton productivity was high (mean: 63 mug C liter-1 day-1) compared with rates reported for other aquatic ecosystems. Somewhat paradoxically, bacterial productivity on plant detritus (mean: 13 mug C g-1 day-1) and sediments (mean: 15 mug C g-1 day-1) was low relative to other locations. On an areal basis, total bacterial productivity in this marsh ecosystem averaged 22 mg C m-2 day-1, based on sample dates in May 1990 and February 1991. Marsh sediments supported the bulk of the production, accounting for 46% (May) and 88% (February) of the total. The remainder was contributed approximately equally by bacteria in the water column and on accumulated stores of plant detritus.

AB  - The distribution and quantity of organic sulfur and iron sulfur species were determined in the Holocene sediments from Mud Lake, Florida. The sediments of this shallow, sinkhole lake are characterized by high sulfur and organic carbon contents as well as active sulfate reduction. They record a shift from a basal peat (below 2 in) comprised of water lily-dominated organic matter to the present cyanobacterial/algal-dominated lake deposit (upper I m). This shift in depositional environment and subsequent organic matter source was accompanied by variation in the amount of reactive iron delivered to the sediments, which in turn influenced the type and extent of organic matter sulfurization. Extractable intramolecular organic sulfur is principally found as C(25) highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) thiolanes. Extractable poly Sulfide-linked lipids, determined by selective chemical cleavage with MeLi/MeI and analyzed as methylthioethers (MTE), are dominated by n-alkanes with sulfur attachments at position 1 and 2, as well as lower amounts of C(25) HBI-MTE. The delta(13)C values and carbon-chain length distribution of both series of n-alkylMTE indicate that they are derived from distinct biological precursors. Among the n-alkyIMTE with sulfur attachment at position I there are three homologous series: one saturated and two with both cis and trans enethiol isomers. The identification of the enethiol in the sulfur-linked macromolecules indicates that n-alkylaldehydes are precursors lipids. The intervals of high concentration of bulk organic sulfur and sulfurized lipids coincide with the intervals of high mineral sulfur content (acid volatile sulfide and chromium reducible sulfur). We suggest that the main control on the enhanced addition of sulfur to the organic matter in Mud Lake was the increased formation of polysulfides during the reduction of iron hydroxides and the subsequent reaction of those polysulfides with mildly oxidized sedimentary organic matter, Copyright (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - We combined Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and mass spectrometric analysis of stable carbon isotopes, a traditional method for tracking DOM sources, to investigate the variation in the complexity of water samples collected along a salinity gradient in Delaware Bay in March and August 2014. Detailed analyses of optical properties (ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) absorbance and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy) were carried out. Results from statistical parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of EEM data were also used to track and further constrain fluorescent DOM (FDOM). Optical analyses and FT-ICR-MS data showed large differences between late winter and summer conditions, and the stable carbon isotopic composition was more variable in summer than in late winter. Although terrestrial inputs of DOM are evident at low salinities in both seasons, our data suggest that a significant source of FDOM, from either in situ water column production or from benthic aquatic or semi-aquatic plant communities, contributes DOM to low and mid-salinity waters in Delaware Bay during summer but not in late winter.

AB  - This study used stable isotope analysis to evaluate the hypothesis that upstream migrations by anadromous clupeid (Alosa spp.) fishes represent an ecologically important seasonal subsidy to annual energy and nutrient budgets for coastal waters of the Atlantic slope. Dual stable isotope ratio analyses (delta(31)C and delta(15)N, parts per thousand) were conducted on >200 samples representing major ecological components of Wards Creek, Virginia, and temporal trends in the stable isotope signatures of these components were related to the timing of Alosa-derived allochthonous inputs. Carbon ratios (delta(13)C) for migratory (oceanic) Alosa spp. arriving in Wards Creek were enriched by 10.2 parts per thousand compared to ratios for resident fishes. The timing and magnitude of shifts in the delta(13)C values of documented Alosa predators suggest that predators in Wards Creek derive a substantial proportion of their biomass carbon from marine sources during the Alosa spawning run. The unique trophic structure of Wards Creek may be related to ecological linkages between tidal fresh waters and coastal marine systems and the greater taxonomic complexity of tidal freshwater faunal assemblages compared to other aquatic systems.

AB  - Spatial and seasonal variations of sulphate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients and metabolic products were determined down to 5 m sediment depth in pore waters of intertidal flats located in NW Germany. The impact of sediment permeability, pore water flow, and organic matter supply on deep pore water biogeochemistry was evaluated. Low sediment permeability leads to an enrichment of remineralisation products in pore waters of clay-rich sediments. in permeable sandy sediments pore water biogeochemistry differs depending on whether tidal flat margins or central parts of the tidal flat are studied. Pore water flow in tidal flat margins increases organic matter input. Substrate availability and enhanced temperatures in summer stimulate sulphate reducers down to 3.5 m sediment depth. Sulphate, DOC, and nutrient concentrations exhibit seasonal variations in deep permeable sediments of the tidal flat margin. In contrast, seasonal variations are small in deep pore waters of central parts of the sand flat. This study shows for the first time that seasonal variations in pore water chemistry are not limited to surface sediments, but may be observed down to some metres depth in permeable tidal flat margin sediments. In such systems more organic matter seems to be remineralised than deduced from surface sediment studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are highly sensitive to changes occurring at the coastline. It is critically important to determine region-specific projections for these areas due to their specificities and vulnerabilities to climate change. This work aimed to value the impacts of recent climate changes at West Africa Sahara coastland, southern Morocco, at Khnifiss Lagoon. We have applied a combined approach using remote sensing techniques and environmental reconstructions based on high-resolution analysis of sediment cores, covering the current warm period. Remote sensing highlighted changes to the lagoon inlet, accompanied by a greater meandering character of the tidal channels. As a response, the sediment cores have recorded a predominant vegetation substitution due to changes in the tidal limit, and an increase in organic carbon accumulation was observed. For the current climatology, during positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, winds reaching the coast strengthen in an east-to-west direction. In the Khnifiss Lagoon, whose inlet is dominated by the ebb tide, the intensity and direction of the winds on the coast at surface level modifies its connection to the ocean by increasing sediment transport toward the interior of the lagoon. Locally biological responses to wind intensification, and possibly sea-level rise, exemplify the lagoon sensitivity to large-scale processes. Coastal vegetated wetlands are considered to be highly dynamic environments. However, we expect a loss of the upper tidal vegetation due to boundary conditions limiting the accommodation space in this arid environment in a possible future scenario of continuously inland tidal line displacement.

AB  - Recent accretion was measured by the feldspar marker horizon method in two gravity-drained, managed, marsh impoundments and unmanaged reference marshes located on the rapidly subsiding coast of Louisiana. Water level management was designed to limit hydrologic exchange to the managed marsh by regulating the direction and rate of water flows. During a drawdown-flooding water management cycle, the unmanaged reference marshes had significantly higher vertical accretion rates, higher soil bulk density and soil mineral matter content, lower soil organic matter content, and higher rates of organic matter accumulation than the managed marsh. The rate of mineral matter accumulation was higher in both reference marshes, but was significantly higher in only one. Spatial variability in accumulation rates was low when analyzed in one managed marsh site, suggesting a primarily autochthonous source of matter. In contrast, the associated reference marsh apparently received allochthonous material that settled out in a distinct spatial pattern as water velocity decreased. The impoundment marshes experienced an accretion deficit of one full order of magnitude (0.1 vs. 1.0 cm/yr) based on comparison of accretion and sea level rise data, while the unmanaged reference marshes experienced a five-fold smaller deficit or no deficit. These data suggest that the gravity-drained impoundments likely have a shorter life expectancy than the reference marshes in the rapidly subsiding Louisiana coast.

AB  - Reconstructing landscapes after open pit mining of the Canadian oil sands presents enormous challenges. Freshwater peatlands dominate the pre-disturbance landscape; however, elevated salinity in the post-disturbance landscape will exclude the use of many freshwater vegetation species for reclamation. Successful reclamation will require plants to grow and accumulate peat despite elevated salinity. We evaluated the potential of salt-tolerant plants to accumulate peat by integrating plant production and decomposition rates in natural and oil sands wetlands across a salinity gradient. These wetlands were dominated by marsh-like vegetation with relatively rapid decomposition, especially of the belowground plant material. Aboveground production was high enough to compensate for rapid decomposition, resulting in mean annual organic matter accumulation of 307 g m(-2). Thus, both natural wetlands (which despite the elevated salinity had peat deposits >35 cm) and the oil sands wetlands accumulated organic matter during the study. There is potential for peat to accumulate in future oil sands wetlands, although long-term accumulation rates may be slower than in undisturbed freshwater fens and bogs. A reliable water supply and a host of other factors will be required for wetlands to accumulate organic matter, and eventually peat, in the post-mining landscape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The relative importance of different organic matter sources to macrobenthic consumers was investigated at two vegetational habitats (Phragmites australis and Suaeda japonica) and at a bare intertidal flat in Suncheon Bay in May and August 2010, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers. The delta C-13 of consumers was much narrower in range than that of potential food sources (microphytobenthos, marsh plants, and riverine and marine particulate organic matter), and values were similar between sites. However, cluster analysis based on the consumer's isotope values showed that they are divided according to functional groups rather than habitat type and taxonomical group, suggesting that the exploitation of different dietary sources depends on feeding strategy. Except for two suspension feeders and nonselective deposit feeders at the Phragmites bed, most consumers had similar delta C-13 to those of microphytobenthos. An isotopic mixing model calculation revealed the consistent importance of microphytobenthos to the nutrition of benthic invertebrates among wetland habitats in different seasons. In contrast, very little contribution of marsh plant-derived organic matter to consumer nutrition was detected at all sites. Furthermore, our results suggest that the summer monsoon event does not lead to a seasonal shift in dietary sources of consumers in this coastal wetland system.

AB  - Coastal wetlands play an increasingly important role in regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus affecting climate change. However, the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of GHG fluxes in these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify patterns and drivers of GHG fluxes across coastal wetlands in China. Average methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were estimated as 2.20 +/- 0.31 mg.m(-2).h(-1), 16.44 +/- 2.96 mu g.m(-2).h(-1), and 388.76 +/- 42.28 mg.m(-2).h(-1), respectively. GHG emissions varied with tidal inundation, where CH4 and CO2 emissions during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. CH4 and CO2 emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude, while N2O did not. CH4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature and aboveground biomass, and CO2 emissions were positively related to soil organic carbon. N2O fluxes were lower with increasing soil pH, and CH4 and CO2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that the fluxes of CH4 and N2O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback to global warming, which is mainly driven by the CH4 emission. Our synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field observations of GHG fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in GHG fluxes and the assessment of net GHG balance and its contribution to the GWP of coastal wetlands.

   A basic knowledge of tidal dynamics is a condition to understand different processes occurring in coastal zones, and in this particular study, in the Tagus estuary. The main goal of this study is to characterize Tagus estuary tidal dynamics through an analysis of the amplitude, phase and tidal ellipses parameters of the main semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents.
   A two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic model was considered to be adequate to simulate Tagus estuary hydrodynamics and a model developed from the SIMSYS2D model was applied. Harmonic analysis of the model results was carried out to identify the main constituents of the tide as well as the tidal ellipses along the entire estuary. This work proved to be important because until the present there were few studies about the specific analysis of these parameters in Tagus estuary, and therefore the estuarine tidal dynamics was barely known. Results showed that the most important semi-diurnal and diurnal constituents in this system are M-2 and K-1, respectively. It was observed that the variations in amplitude occur where changes in the estuary morphology and depth are larger. The ellipses orientation reveals the importance of the bottom topography and of the bay geometry on the tidal fluxes, with the main flux being through the deeper zones. In fact, model results show that the tidal dynamics of this system is extremely dependent on the estuarine topography and coastline features, resulting essentially from a balance between convergence/divergence and friction effects and from an estuarine resonance mode with a period close to twelve hours.

AB  - The sulphur cycle in the sediment of the Venice canal network was investigated by considering the sulphate reduction rate (SRR) and the distribution of sulphur compounds, in both pore water and sediment. Sulphate reduction (SR) is the main process in the metabolism of the organic matter supplied to the network by untreated urban effluents. Although it might account for the decomposition of only a limited percentage of the total organic-C inputs, the estimated rates are among the highest observed in coastal sediments. Measured rates range from 0.26 to 0.99 ltmol cm(-3) d(-1), while mean annual values, estimated by a diagenetic model, vary from 0.16 to 0.43 mu mol cm(-3) d(-1). The speciation of S in the sediment reveals that pyrite-S is the most abundant component of the total reduced S pool, whereas acid volatile sulphides and elemental sulphur together account for less than 45%. A preliminary budget indicates that the rate of burial of solid-phase S is small compared to the S produced by SR (from 10 to 25%). A large amount of reduced S is then lost from the canal deposits to be re-oxidised at the sediment-water interface or in the overlying water column. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effects of land use on hydrology, organic matter sources, and processing may be proportionately greater in tidal creeks than large estuaries, yet tidal creek systems have been undervalued in assessments of emerging effects of anthropogenic land use. Through sampling of dated sediment cores, we identified indicators of historical land use change (past 150 yr) in a microtidal northern Gulf of Mexico tidal creek system in the early stages of urbanization. We found that tidal creeks differed from open water sites, and urbanized sites differed from less altered sites, primarily due to changes in carbon sources indicated by differences in sediment stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values, and concentrations of fecal indicator bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Total organic carbon (%TOC) and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) increased twofold in tidal creeks during upstream urbanization in the early 20th century, which led to elevated mid-century sediment TOC accumulation rates (5-10 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)), followed by decreases in TOC accumulation in tidal creeks and open waters since the 1960s (0.4-1.8 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)). C. perfringens and nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) were, respectively, 1.8 and 1.5 times higher at wastewater-influenced sites than at other sites, increasing through time or remaining high at wastewater-influenced sites from approximately the 1950s-present, when human populations quadrupled. Hence, urbanization altered estuarine inputs from upland C sources and increased inputs from human-derived N and microbes. These findings suggest that tidal creeks are more sensitive archives of land-use change than open water systems due to their proximity and greater connectivity to the watershed.

AB  - Mixed-redox (suboxic, or oscillating between oxidizing and reducing conditions) to anoxic marine sediments from the Raritan -New York Bay complex and the Inner New York Bight of the eastern U.S. were studied to investigate the factors controlling the accumulation of pore-water dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOC increased with depth at each of four study sites, but accumulation was generally limited in the mixed-redox zone relative to the anoxic zone. Humic-like fluorescence intensity also differed between mixed-redox and anoxic zones of the sediment, such that anoxic pore waters were relatively enriched in fluorescent. humic-like compounds.
   A pore-water DOC model was tested for its capacity to explain these geochemical patterns. Model results for a heavily irrigated and a non-bioturbated site both suggest that, excluding the uppermost few cm of the sediment column, pore-water DOC is predominantly comprised of poorly-reactive material with estimated degradation rate constants on the order of 10(-3) yr(-1). Model results are also consistent with the suggestion that DOC accumulation is suppressed in the mixed-redox compared to the anoxic zones of the sediment due to rapid oxidation of high-molecular-weight DOC, and limited production and enhanced oxidation of the less reactive polymeric low-molecular-weight component of the DOC pool. An assessment of sorptive behavior of DOC in the surface sediments of the study area suggests that sorption can influence pore-water DOC distributions under conditions of high sedimentation and low bioirrigation.

AB  - The ability of the simultaneously extracted metals/acid volatile sulfides ( n-ary sumation SEM/AVS) index to ascertain environmental risk from potentially toxic elements in calcareous saltmarsh soils was tested using structural equation modeling. This technique allows the detection of both direct and indirect relationships among AVS, SEM, and other soil variables, representing results in a graphical view. The dataset included 90 soil samples from 21 different sites belonging to 6 different saltmarshes and featured a wide range of soil chemicophysical properties. Variables included in the a priori model were hydroperiod, pH, soil redox potential, labile organic carbon, carbonates, total iron, and total amount of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The best optimized model pointed out the main soil properties that affect AVS accumulation and SEM speciation in these soils. Effect plots of AVS and SEM calculated with the partial linear mixed-effects models included in the piecewise structural equation modeling showed a significant and positive influence of pH and carbonates on AVS and a highly significant effect of carbonates and labile organic carbon on SEM. Single SEM components were also considered separately, to define the potential contributions of labile organic carbon or carbonates as alternative binding phases. Simultaneously extracted Cu, Ni, and Zn were preferentially bound to carbonates, followed by labile organic carbon, whereas Pb and Cd were easily bound to labile organic carbon.

AB  - The C sequestration in coastal blue carbon (C-b) ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, was discovered to be useful in mitigating the increasing trend of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to climate change. In this study, we systematically estimate traditional C-b ecosystem distribution and the associated C-b sequestration rate, and then further quantify the C-b sinks fishery contribution to C-b ecosystem due to human activity in coastal ecosystem. The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively. In China, the C-b pools are 162 TgC in mangroves, 67 TgC in saltmarshes and 75 TgC in seagrass. The human activity induced global C-b sink fishery on C-b ecosystem is about 26.58-37.6 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 30.7%-43.4% of the world's traditional C-b sequestration ecosystem. The global C-b sequestration potential reaches up to 86.59 Tg yr(-1), while China can explain 1.70% of the world's total C-b sequestration. However, in China, the C-b sequestration due to human activity reaches up to 632-7.89 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 20.9%-23.7% of global C-b sink fishery. Therefore, it is very important to build the C-b sink fisheries measure and monitor system to scientifically valuate C-b sink fisheries and associated development potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estimates of rates of organic matter degradation by bacterial sulfate reduction in aquifers are few, and all are obtained by indirect means.  Here we present the first direct radiotracer measurements of in situ rates of sulfate reduction for an aquifer (Romo, Denmark).  Sulfate reduction occurs in distinct reaction zones within the aquifer at rates that vary greatly over short lateral distances.  In situ rates of sulfate reduction are significantly higher than previous indirect estimates.  In contrast, rates of sulfate reduction in aquifers are orders of magnitude lower than in marine and limnic environments, emphasizing the low reactivity of natural organic matter in aquifers.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and saltmarsh environments, can store significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC); however, most studies focus on tropical and subtropical environments. We assessed SOC stocks and fractions in temperate mangrove (two sites) and saltmarsh (sites SM1, SM2 and SM3) environments in southern Australia. The SOC fractions were separated according to particulate organic carbon (POC), humic carbon (HC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) by size fractionation. Saltmarsh sites generally had the highest SOC content (up to 12.4% SOC). The POC fraction was the highest at the surface in the saltmarsh site and decreased relative to the HC and RC fractions with depth. Conversely, the proportion of POC at the mangrove sites did not decrease with depth, forming up to 76% of the SOC. The vertical displacement of soil of up to 5.8 mm year(-1) at the saltmarsh sites, measured using root ingrowth bags, suggest significant contributions of POC via root materials. Retention of these POC inputs are likely to be related to waterlogging, which decreases decomposition rates - with much lower soil moisture content at SM1, where the lowest POC content occurred below the surface, compared with SM2 and SM3.

AB  - Wetland restoration and creation efforts have been widely attempted as a way to compensate for wetland losses and to recover wetland functions; however, to date, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content recovery at a regional scale. This meta-analysis synthesizes 48 articles to identify the general patterns of soil C and N change after wetland restoration and creation in the United States. Our results indicate that, after 11-20 years, soil C and N in restored and created wetlands are still significantly lower by 51.7% and 50.3%, respectively, than those in natural wetlands. The soil C and N in restored wetlands recovered faster than in created wetlands. Furthermore, the soil C in restored organic flat and created depressional wetlands recovered more rapidly than in restored and created hydrologically open wetlands (riverine and tidal), respectively. Mean annual temperature and soil texture were recognized as two crucial abiotic factors affecting soil C and N recovery. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between the restoration and creation effect sizes on soil C and N, indicating that wetlands may alleviate N limitations intrinsically during C recovery processes.

AB  - Tidal dynamics of shallow estuaries and lagoons is a complex matter that has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers over the last few decades. The main purpose of the present work is to study the intricate tidal dynamics of the Tagus estuary, which states as the largest estuary of the Iberian Peninsula and one of the most important wetlands in Portugal and Europe. Tagus has large areas of low depth and a remarkable geomorphology, both determining the complex propagation of tidal waves along the estuary of unknown manner. A non-linear two-dimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic model was considered to be adequate to simulate its hydrodynamics and an application developed from the SIMSYS2D model was applied to study the tidal propagation along the estuary. The implementation and calibration of this model revealed its accuracy to predict tidal properties along the entire system. Several model runs enabled the analysis of the local variations in tidal dynamics, through the interpretation of amplitude and phase patterns of the main tidal constituents, tidal asymmetry, tidal ellipses, form factor and tidal dissipation. Results show that Tagus estuary tidal dynamics is extremely dependent on an estuarine resonance mode for the semi-diurnal constituents that induce important tidal characteristics. Besides, the estuarine coastline features and topography determines the changes in tidal propagation along the estuary, which therefore result essentially from a balance between convergence/divergence and friction and advection effects, besides the resonance effects.

AB  - We experimentally increased salinities in a tidal freshwater marsh on the Altamaha River (Georgia, USA) by exposing the organic rich soils to 3.5 yr of continuous (press) and episodic (pulse) treatments with dilute seawater to simulate the effects of climate change such as sea level rise (press) and drought (pulse). We quantified changes in root production and decomposition, soil elevation, and soil C stocks in replicated (n = 6) 2.5 x 2.5 m field plots. Elevated salinity had no effect on root decomposition, but it caused a significant reduction in root production and belowground biomass that is needed to build and maintain soil elevation capital. The lack of carbon inputs from root production resulted in reduced belowground biomass of 1631 +/- 308 vs. 2964 +/- 204 g/m(2)in control plots and an overall 2.8 +/- 0.9 cm decline in soil surface elevation in the press plots in the first 3.5 yr, whereas the control (no brackish water additions) and the fresh (river water only) treatments gained 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 cm, respectively, in a 3.5-yr period. There was no change in elevation of pulse plots after 3.5 yr. Based on measurements of bulk density and soil C, the decline of 2.8 cm of surface elevation resulted in a loss of 1.4 +/- 0.08 kg C/m(2)in press plots. In contrast, the control and the fresh treatment plots gained 0.7 +/- 0.05 and 0.8 +/- 0.05 kg C/m(2), respectively, which represents a net change in C storage of more than 2 kg C/m(2). We conclude that, when continuously exposed to saltwater intrusion, the tidal freshwater marsh's net primary productivity, especially root production, and not decomposition, are the main drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. Reduced productivity leads to loss of soil elevation and soil C, which has important implications for tidal freshwater marsh persistence in the face of rising sea level.

AB  - We examined the effects of tidal fluctuations on CO2 and CH4 fluxes from sediment or soil to the atmosphere in the littoral zone of a brackish-water lake during the growing seasons in 2004 and 2005. The dominant plants at the study site formed three sub-zones (Phragmites zone, Juncus zone and Miscanthus zone) across a topographic gradient on the shoreline. In the Phragmites and Juncus zones, we observed a positive correlation between hourly changes in CO2 and CH4 fluxes and changes in the water table. In particular, the magnitude and pattern of daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes were different on days during spring tide and neap tide in the Phragmites and Juncus zones. Variations in CO2 and CH4 fluxes in the Phragmites and Juncus zones over the course of a day during spring tide were correlated with water-table level. We found that the rate of change of the water table, as distinguished from just differences in the water table, was a major environmental factor controlling the CO2 and CH4 fluxes. In the Miscanthus zone during spring tide, soil temperature was the main factor affecting daily variation in CO2 and CH4 fluxes.

AB  - How common reed (Phragmites australis Trin. ex Steud.) colonization correlates to soil heterogeneity and environmental determinants remains unclear in arid areas. We conducted a field investigation and soil sampling in 100 plots along Keriya River Basin to uncover the relationship between common reed and heterogeneous soils. Reed colonization variables and its soil properties were measured and recorded for the analysis of their relationship using pearson correlation and redundancy analysis methods. The comparison results of common reed characteristics among 100 plots showed that common reeds performed strong tolerance and ecophysiological plasticity to edaphic stresses. Common reed colonization was tightly connected to soil heterogeneity according to the correlation analysis between its colonization characteristics and soil properties. Common reed colonization got feedbacks on soil properties as well, including the increase of soil organic matter and the alleviation of salt uplifting. The main limiting environmental determinant of common reed colonization was soil salt, followed by pH and soil water content.

AB  - Estuaries are characterized by a variety of interrelated, abiotic and biotic, structural components and intensive physical, chemical, and biological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal- and tidal-mediated variability in water temperature, salinity, suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and zooplankton abundance in the Bahia Blanca estuary, Argentina. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed variability are also discussed. Sampling was carried out every two months (December 2004-April 2006) during 14-h tidal cycles in a fixed station located in the inner zone of the estuary. Vertical profiles of temperature and salinity and water samples were obtained at the surface and the bottom to determine SPM, POM, Chl-a, and zooplankton. SPM (97.3 +/- 6.9 mg L-1) showed a strong seasonality, mainly attributed to biological activity. POM concentration (1539 +/- 107.6 mgC m(-1)) was high, possibly derived from vascular plants and benthic microalgae. Chl-a (6.91 +/- 0.73 mg m(-3)) and zooplankton (2024.23 +/- 9.16 individuals m(-3)) also showed a seasonal pattern, with higher concentrations in the summer. During the tidal cycle, the highest amounts of the measured variables were observed during the ebb tide. The results highlight the strong variability in the physicochemical and biological variables at different time scales in mesotidal, temperate estuaries. It is essential to take into account this variability in any monitoring program performed in a temperate system dominated by such a tidal regime.

AB  - We examined the isotopic compositions of fatty acids, sterols, and hydrocarbons isolated from three coastal macrophytes (Zostera marina, Spartina alterniflora, and Juncus roemerianus) in order to investigate the relative contribution of these vascular plants as sources of organic matter in coastal sediments such as Cape Lookout Eight, North Carolina. On average, lipid biomarker compounds extracted from the plants were depleted in C-13 by 3-5 parts per thousand relative to delta(13)C total organic carbon (TOC). However, individual compounds within each lipid class varied by up to 5.6 parts per thousand. Trends in the isotopic compositions of lipids were consistent with delta(13)C(TOC); compounds obtained from Z. marina were the most enriched in C-13 and those from J. roemerianus were the most depleted. The range in isotopic abundances and molecular compositions of the sediments was greater than that obtained from the plants, indicating that additional, presently unidentified sources of organic matter contribute to the Cape Lookout Eight sediments. Similarity between the signatures for suspended particulate matter and the sediments indicates that much of the sedimentary organic matter is derived from algal and bacterial sources. Bacterial sources of organic matter are Likely greater during summer/early fall, and incorporation of C-13-enriched bacterial biomass may contribute to observed seasonal shifts in delta(13)C(TOC) in the surficial sediments.

AB  - The principal scenario concerning the potential effects of climate change on mangrove forest communities revolves around sealevel rise with emphases on coastal abandonment and inland retreat attributable to flooding and saline intrusion. However, at the decade to century scale, changes in precipitation and catchment runoff may be a more significant factor at the regional level. Specifically, for any given sealevel elevation it is hypothesized that reduced rainfall and runoff would necessarily result in higher salinity and greater seawater-sulfate exposure. This would likely be associated with decreased production and increased sediment organic matter decomposition leading to subsidence. In contrast, higher rainfall and runoff would result in reduced salinity and exposure to sulfate, and also increase the delivery of terrigenous nutrients. Consequently, mangrove production would increase and sediment elevations would be maintained. Support for this scenario derives from studies of the high production in saline mangrove impoundments which are depleted in seawater sulfate. This paper also examines other components of climate change, such as UVb, temperature, and storm frequency, and presents a suite of hypotheses and analytical protocols to encourage scientific discussion and testing.

AB  - Estuaries profoundly transform the large amounts of carbon delivered from rivers before their transfer to the adjacent coastal zone. As a consequence of the complex biogeochemical reworking of allochthonous carbon in the sediments and the water column, CO2 and CH4 are emitted into the atmosphere. We attempt to synthesize available knowledge on biogeochemical cycling of CO2 and CH4 in estuarine environments, with a particular emphasis on the exchange with the atmosphere. Unlike CH4, the global emission of CO2 to the atmosphere from estuaries is significant compared to other components of the global carbon cycle.

AB  - Invasive plants compete with natives, and their litter can suppress natives and alter ecosystem function. Understanding the mechanisms of effect of invasive plants and testing whether invader removal reverses these effects is important to guide restoration and management. We addressed these questions in a Great Lakes marsh invaded by Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail), which produces monodominant stands with considerable litter accumulation. We teased apart effects of live T. x glauca versus its litter on the marsh ecosystem with a live/litter transplant experiment, and tested whether effects were reversible by a live/litter removal experiment in a Typha stand. Over two to four years, in both native marsh and Typha stand, the presence of litter decreased light and increased inorganic nitrogen. Live T. x glauca addition to the native marsh increased inorganic nitrogen and soil organic matter, but removal did not reverse these effects. Litter addition decreased native richness and abundance, and litter removal reversed these effects; however, characteristic native marsh sedges and rushes were not restored, but rather terrestrial grasses and forbs recruited. This suggests that litter removal is essential in cattail restoration projects to increase diversity, but that further active management will likely be necessary to restore marsh communities per se. Because many wetland invaders share similar traits with T. x glauca, including litter accumulation, conclusions are broadly applicable to a variety of wetland invasions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is generally assumed that shrimp cultured in intensive aquaculture systems receive little or no nutrition from natural pond biota. However, recent experiments indicate that even under intensive growout conditions, shrimp growth is enhanced by unknown growth factors produced autochthonously in an intensive shrimp pond. As part of an ongoing research effort to characterize the growth factors contained in shrimp pond water, an experiment was conducted to compare the effects of pond water, with selected solid fractions removed, on the growth of juvenile white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei. Fractions were removed from pond water by passing the water through a series of mechanical and activated carbon filters.
   In the presence of water-column solids between 0.5 and 5.0-mu-m, shrimp growth rates increased by 53% over growth rates attained in clear well water, while solids > 5.0-mu-m improved shrimp growth by an additional 36%. These solids consisted predominantly of microalgae and microbial-detrital aggregates. Solids < 0.5-mu-m, including dissolved organic carbon, did not appear to contribute to shrimp growth. Water-column solids produced autochthonously in shrimp ponds are also known to improve growth in oysters, brine shrimp, and calanoid copepods. Efforts continue to further characterize these solids and to explore the possibility of their extraction, preservation, and use as feed additives.

AB  - Mangrove- and saltmarsh-dominated estuaries have high rates of organic carbon burial. Here, we estimate soil, pore water, and surface-water carbon fluxes in an Australian estuarine tidal creek to assess whether (1) advective pore water exchange releases some of the soil carbon, (2) outwelling (lateral exports) represents a major carbon sequestration mechanism, and (3) methane emissions offset soil carbon sequestration. A radon (Rn-222) mass balance implied tidally driven pore-water exchange rates ranging from 5.5 +/- 3.6 to 15.6 +/- 8.1 cm d(-1). Pore water exchange explained most of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and methane surface-water fluxes but not dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity. Organic carbon burial in soils derived from Pu239 + 240 dating was 11-63 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Methane and carbon dioxide emissions at the water-air interface were 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 63 +/- 166 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. When calculated as CO2-equivalents, aquatic CH4 emissions converted to 19-94 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Upscaling methane and soil carbon fluxes to representative areas revealed that CH4 emissions could offset < 5% of soil carbon burial. DIC outwelling (12 +/- 6 mmol m(-2) catchment d(-1)) was less than five-fold greater than DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) outwelling and four-fold greater than catchment-wide carbon burial. Because much of this DIC remains in the ocean after air-water equilibration, lateral DIC exports may represent an important long-term carbon sink. Recent research has focused on quantifying carbon burial rates in blue carbon habitats such as saltmarshes and mangroves. We suggest that DIC outwelling and methane outgassing should also be considered when assessing the carbon sequestration capacity of these coastal vegetated habitats.

AB  - The distribution of both carbon and nutrient stores in the landscape is not homogeneous, and is influenced by soil properties such as texture and organic content as well as spatial gradients such as inundation frequency. In this study the distribution of water extractable soil nutrients and water mobile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its bioavailability were investigated at specific levels along a cross-sectional gradient that extended from the baseflow level deep in the channel to the floodplain. The frequency with which these specific levels are inundated was modelled under three flow regimes to determine if flow change is likely to influence nutrient supply to the river. Soil surface litter and soil organic carbon content, DOC and SRP increased along a trajectory from the base of the channel onto the floodplain. Ammonium increased and nitrate decreased as in-channel height decreased. This reflects an increase in soil inundation frequency lower in the channel decreasing nitrification rates and increasing NO3- losses via mobilisation and denitrification. Bioavailable soil DOC (BDOC) was lowest in the most frequently inundated soils; however, overall soil BDOC did not relate to either changing soil properties or inundation frequency. There were no significant differences in nutrient and carbon supply to the river under the three modelled flow regimes (with flows extraction rules, without flow extraction rules and natural flows) explored as flow change was most marked in the channel bed region, where little organic matter was stored.

AB  - We investigated the morphological and genetic variations found in Suaeda maritima growing on sand dunes at Jogeum-naru, Muan-gun, in Korea. Our objective was to determine how plant density, biomass, and morphological characteristics were affected by habitat and environmental factors. Differences in elevation dictated that habitats for this species be divided into three positions: low, middle, and high areas. The higher the elevation, the lower the amount of available water, total nitrogen, phosphate, and organic matter. Correlations between biomass and environment were statistically significant. For example, plant density and biomass declined as elevation increased. in low areas, the lengths of aerial stems and leaves were 17.98 +/- 0.46 and 7.83 +/- 0.12 mm, respectively; values measured at high areas were 0.70 and 0.83 times smaller, respectively. Likewise, lengths of main roots in low areas were 8.06 +/- 0.21 mm; in higher areas, roots were 1.58 times longer. Leaf widths in low areas were 1.88 +/- 0.01 mm, and 1.16 times greater at higher elevations. Values for these parameters in middle areas were intermediate between those for the other two. Nevertheless, when we used an MVSP computer program to conduct a similarity coefficient analysis, we found that the morphological variations recorded at the three elevations were not matched by differences in DNA patterns, although genetic variations were observed within individual populations.

AB  - Fiddler crabs are a key benthic macrofauna group in estuarine environments. Species distribution is determined by relatively distinct zones, based on biotic and abiotic factors. As sediment organic matter is thought to be one of the most important zoning factors of mangrove macrofauna, we tested the effects of organic matter content on the infra-specific distribution of the fiddler crabs Leptuca thayeri and Leptuca uruguayensis. Organic matter content and crab abundance and size were assessed in both species by field observations, while the choice of adult or juvenile L. uruguayensis for high -or low- organic matter was tested in the laboratory. Both species showed no relationship between organic matter and crab abundance or size. Furthermore, L. uruguayensis juveniles or adults did not show any preference for specific organic matter content. Therefore, fiddler crabs intraspecific distribution in mangrove forests is not dependent of the water-land gradient decrease of organic matter.

AB  - There is a growing interest in how the management of 'blue carbon' sequestered by coastal wetlands can influence global greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets. A promising intervention is through restoring tidal exchange to impounded coastal wetlands for reduced methane (CH4) emissions. We monitored an impounded wetland's GHG flux (CO2 and CH4) prior to and following tidal reinstatement. We found that biogeochemical responses varied across an elevation gradient. The low elevation zone experienced a greater increase in water level and an associated greater marine transition in the sediment microbial community (16S rRNA) than the high elevation zone. The low elevation zone's GHG emissions had a reduced sustained global warming potential of 264 gm(-2) yr(-1) CO2-e over 100 years, and it increased to 351 gm(-2) yr(-1) with the removal of extreme rain events. However, emission benefits were achieved through a reduction in CO2 emissions, not CH4 emissions. Overall, the wetland shifted from a prior CH4 sink (-0.07 to -1.74 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) to a variable sink or source depending on the elevation site and rainfall. This highlights the need to consider a wetland's initial GHG emissions, elevation and future rainfall trends when assessing the efficacy of tidal reinstatement for GHG emission control.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are critical in the global carbon budget while vulnerable to plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a typical invasive plant species, has rapidly expanded in China's coastal area since 1979, which disturbed the carbon cycle of the coastal wetland ecosystems. However, until now, the effect and underlying mechanisms of S. alterniflora invasion on methanotrophs are poorly known in coastal wetlands. Here, a largescale investigation of the activity, abundance and community structure of methanotrophs was conducted in seven wetlands under both native (dominated by Phragmites australis, Kandelia candel or Avicennia marina) and invasive plants (dominated by S. alterniflora) across the southeast coast of China. Compared with the native community, S. alterniflora invasion led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in activity and abundance of methanotrophs, which increased by 62.1% and 64.0% in average, respectively. The invasion of S. alterniflora did not greatly alter the methanotrophic community structure in most of the examined wetlands. However, the relative abundance of type I methanotrophs decreased under P. australis community, while type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis) increased after S. alterniflora invasion. In addition, the soil organic carbon content, ammonium content and salinity were identified as important environmental factors affecting the activity and community structure of methanotrophs. Overall, our results demonstrated that the activity and abundance of methanotrophs responded positively to S. alterniflora invasion, suggesting the important role of methanotrophs in reducing methane emissions from China's coastal wetlands.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine nursery grounds are essential habitats for sustaining flatfish stocks since only these shallow and productive areas provide the high food supply that allows maximizing juvenile growth and survival in most flatfish species. However, the main organic matter sources at the basis of benthic food webs might differ drastically between estuarine nursery grounds under strong freshwater influences, where food webs are mainly supported by continental organic matter, and coastal ecosystems under limited freshwater influence, where the local marine primary production is the main source of carbon for the benthos. To better understand the links between continental inputs to the coastal zone and stock maintenance in the highly prized common sole, Solea solea (L.), we investigated the variability in the organic matter sources supporting the growth of its young-of-the-year (YoY) in five contrasted estuarine and coastal nursery grounds under varying freshwater influence. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen allowed tracing the origin of the organic matter exploited by YoY soles in the very first months following their benthic settlement, i.e. when most of the juvenile mortality occurs in the species. A mixing model was run to unravel and quantify the contribution of all major potential sources of organic matter to sole food webs, with a sensitivity analysis allowing assessment of the impact of various trophic enrichment factors on model outputs. This meta-analysis demonstrated a relative robustness of the estimation of the respective contributions of the various organic matter sources. At the nursery scale, the upstream increase in freshwater organic matter exploitation by YoY soles and its positive correlation with inter-annual variations in the river flow confirmed previous conclusions about the importance of organic matter from continental origin for juvenile production. However, inter-site differences in the organic matter sources exploited for growth showed that, although freshwater organic matter use is significant in all nursery sites, it is never dominant, with especially high contributions of local primary production by microphytobenthos or saltmarsh macrophytes to juvenile sole growth in tidal nursery ecosystems. These patterns stress the need for maintaining both the intensity of freshwater inputs to the coastal zone and of local autochthonous primary production (especially that of the intertidal microphytobenthos) to preserve the nursery function of coastal and estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - An understanding of trace metal pollution due to reclamation activities around Yancheng National Nature Reserve is important for the utilisation and management of the reserve and surrounding coastal and marine areas. In the present study, we evaluated the current state of Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn pollution (total concentrations and ecological risk), their potential hazard (availability index and desorption rate) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, iron and manganese oxide content, soil organic matter, salinity and pH) in different land use types around this nature reserve. Although the current state of trace metal pollution was not severe, the potential hazards of these trace metals should not be ignored, especially for Cd because of its significantly higher availability index values in farmlands and aquaculture ponds than in natural habitats (by 33 and 32% of the total amount of Cd respectively). Thus, strict monitoring and environmentally responsible land reclamation management practices should be considered for these coastal areas.

AB  - There are divergent views about the dominant factors controlling vegetation distribution in coastal deltas. To determine the dominant factors controlling vegetation distribution, we explored the relationships between six abiotic factors (annual temperature, annual precipitation, soil organic matter, soil moisture, soil salinity, soil pH) and vegetation patterns along a belt transect throughout seven vegetation zones (bare beach, seepweed, common reed, meadow, rice, maize, woods) in the Liaohe Delta. The methods of data analysis included the Kriging interpolation method, grade-ranks method, correlation analysis, Euclidean distance analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis. Contrary to the view that climate controls vegetation pattern, our results suggested that climate had a limited influence on vegetation pattern. Edaphic factors were shown to exert the strongest influence on vegetation pattern, with soil salinity being identified as the dominant factor, followed by soil moisture, soil pH, and soil organic matter.

AB  - The decomposition of macroalgal detritus (tubular and planar Ulva spp.) was studied in a microcosm under a daily light:dark cycle to simulate the decomposition on intertidal sediment. The consequences of bloom decay were evaluated in the bulk water phase and in the sediment. Inorganic nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, PO43- and SiO32-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) were measured in the inflowing and outflowing seawater. Vertical microprofiles Of 02, pH and H2S at the sediment-water interface, sediment contents of organic matter (OM), inorganic and organic carbon (C,,,g), total nitrogen (N) and inorganic nutrients were measured before and after addition of macroalgal detritus. Changes in the taxonomic composition of microphytobenthos were studied by optical microscopy and by the analysis of photosynthetic pigments. Macroalgal detritus vanished from the sediment surface in 6 d. Macroalgal decomposition shifted the microcosm net balance to higher releases of DOC, DIC and inorganic nutrients, suggesting rapid release from macroalgal biomass. Besides being released to the water column, a fraction of macroalgal carbon and of nitrogen was incorporated into the sediment as indicated by a transient increase in C-org and N. Aerobic mineralization of macroalgal detritus reduced 02 in the water column and the sediment. Microbenthos photosynthetic activity was initially suppressed but recovered from the third day as macroalgal detritus decomposed. Photosynthetic 02 production by microbenthos largely determined the fraction of macroalgal detritus that was aerobically mineralised. Decomposition of macroalgal detritus favoured the dominance of cyanobacteria over diatoms in the microbenthos.

AB  - The impact of redox potential (E-H), pH, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), chloride (Cl-), aliphatic and aromatic dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and sulfate (SO42-) on the release of dissolved arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), and vanadium (V) were studied in Louisiana freshwater marsh Wax Lake Delta soil (Mississippi River) using an automated biogeochemical microcosm apparatus. The experiment was conducted from reducing (-60 mV) to stepwise oxidizing (+491 mV) conditions. The initial pH was 7.4 and decreased under reducing conditions to 4.9, and remained constant during the increase of EN. Concentrations of As (1.3-120.5 mu g L-1), V (0.9-48.6 mu g L-1), Fe, DOC, and the specific UV absorbance increased under reducing conditions and decreased with rising E-H. Release of As and V appeared to be related to changes of E-H/pH, co-precipitation with Fe oxides, and the release of dissolved aromatic carbon compounds. Concentrations of soluble Cd (4.8-11.2 mu g L-1), Mn, SO42-, and Cl- increased under oxidizing conditions. Release of Co (166.6-258.2 mu g L-1) was related to the chemistry of Fe, Mn and DOC. Phospholipid fatty acids analysis indicated the potential for the microbial community to be involved in biogeochemical processes such as the formation of sulfides, oxidation and reduction of compounds, and the bio-methylation of elements such as As. Overall, we measured a release of As and V under anoxic conditions, while oxic conditions favored the release of Cd. These results outline concern on the potential risk of mobilization of toxic elements in temporary waterlogged soils for agricultural purposes in deltaic ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the geochemical dynamics of sediment organic matter (OM) and examined the usefulness of sedimentary OM delta C-13, TOC and C/N proxies for reconstructions of the depositional history from mangrove sediments in a coastal site of the Pearl River mouth region. The analyses of the delta C-13, TOC and C/N from plant leaves and sediment OM of three mangrove vegetation zones (mudflat with macro-algae, mangrove forest and supratidal mixed forest) across a mangrove wetland indicate significant exchanges of mangrove OM with marine aquatic algal OM and mixed forest plant OM caused by tidal currents and freshwater discharge in both landward and seaward directions. Despite the OM exchanges, the delta C-13, TOC and C/N of modern surface sediments show values distinctive between mudflat, mangrove and mixed forest zones. Specifically, these three signatures appear as -24.3 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, 1.6 +/- 0.2% and 4.4 +/- 1.3 for mudflat sediment, -26.8 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand, 3.1 +/- 0.7% and 8.6 +/- 1.6 for mangrove sediment, and -28.5 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, 8.4 +/- 2.2% and 11.9 +/- 2.0 for mixed forest sediment. Such clear divisions of sediment OM signatures between vegetational zones confirm their usefulness as coastal environmental proxies. Together with the chronologies based on radiocarbon, 210 Pb and 137 Cs analyses, these proxies were successfully applied to sediment cores to reconstruct the mangrove wetland's depositional history in the past century. This study has enhanced our understanding on organic geochemical dynamics in mangrove environments, and the improved reconstruction provides new insights into environmental responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers.

AB  - Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

AB  - New aspects and advancements in classical uncertainty propagation methods were used to develop a nutrient budget with associated uncertainty for a northern Gulf of Mexico coastal embayment. Uncertainty was calculated for budget terms by propagating the standard error and degrees of freedom. New aspects include the combined use of Monte Carlo simulations with classical error propagation methods, uncertainty analyses for GIS computations, and uncertainty propagation involving literature and subjective estimates of terms used in the budget calculations. The methods employed are broadly applicable to the mathematical operations employed in ecological studies involving step-by-step calculations, scaling procedures, and calculations of variables from direct measurements and/or literature estimates. Propagation of the standard error and the degrees of freedom allowed for calculation of the uncertainty intervals around every term in the budget. For scientists and environmental managers, the methods developed herein provide a relatively simple framework to propagate and assess the contributions of uncertainty in directly measured and literature estimated variables to calculated variables. Application of these methods to environmental data used in scientific reporting and environmental management will improve the interpretation of data and simplify the estimation of risk associated with decisions based on ecological studies.

AB  - Organic matter (OM) remineralization plays a key role in controlling the biogeochemistry of marine sediments. Through their burrowing activities, bioturbating macrofauna not only induces physical, chemical and biological modifications, which can affect microbial communities responsible for organic matter remineralization, but it could also directly affect the distribution and bioavailability of sedimentary organic matter. Through in situ experiments manipulating crab and burrow density in intertidal soft-bottoms, we assessed if crab-bioturbation affects benthic metabolism, and the amount, distribution, and bioavailability of sedimentary OM. Crab-bioturbation enhanced overall benthic metabolism and benthic flux of dissolved OM toward the water column at both mudflat and saltmarsh zones. Moreover, our results revealed that bioturbation also changes the quality, bioavailability and distribution of sedimentary OM in mudflats and saltmarshes. Overall, bioturbation enhanced the proportion of labile organic carbon of bioturbated sediments and homogenized the sediment column in terms of their proportion of labile organic carbon. However, crabs also generated biogenic structures (e.g., mounds) that could promote spatial heterogeneity of high nutritional-value OM. Bioturbation-induced changes on benthic metabolism and on OM availability would result in a reduction of the storage capacity of carbon in our intertidal systems. Previous works indicated that crab-burrows trap detritus and OM-rich sediments. Our results suggest that detritus are efficiently remineralized at bioturbated sediment, and finally they are quickly exported to the water column as CO2 and DOC. Thus, crabs are modifying the OM processing at intertidal soft bottoms, and the ways in which carbon is exported to coastal waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetlands can influence global climate via greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Few studies have quantified the full GHG budget of wetlands due to the high spatial and temporal variability of fluxes. We report annual open-water diffusion and ebullition fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O from a restored emergent marsh ecosystem. We combined these data with concurrent eddy-covariance measurements of whole-ecosystem CO2 and CH4 exchange to estimate GHG fluxes and associated radiative forcing effects for the whole wetland, and separately for open-water and vegetated cover types. Annual open-water CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were 915 +/- 95 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), 2.9 +/- 0.5 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), and 62 +/- 17 mg N-N2O m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Diffusion dominated open-water GHG transport, accounting for > 99% of CO2 and N2O emissions, and -71% of CH4 emissions. Seasonality was minor for CO2 emissions, whereas CH4 and N2O fluxes displayed strong and asynchronous seasonal dynamics. Notably, the overall radiative forcing of open-water fluxes (3.5 +/- 0.3 kg CO(2)eq m(-2) yr(-1)) exceeded that of vegetated zones (1.4 +/- 0.4 kg CO2-eq m(-2) yr(-1)) due to high ecosystem respiration. After scaling results to the entire wetland using object-based cover classification of remote sensing imagery, net uptake of CO2 (-1.4 +/- 0.6 kt CO2-eq yr(-1)) did not offset CH4 emission (3.7 +/- 0.03 kt CO2-eq yr(-1)), producing an overall positive radiative forcing effect of 2.4 +/- 0.3 kt CO2-eq yr(-1). These results demonstrate clear effects of seasonality, spatial structure, and transport pathway on the magnitude and composition of wetland GHG emissions, and the efficacy of multiscale flux measurement to overcome challenges of wetland heterogeneity.

AB  - The seasonal dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a subterranean estuary were examined in a coastal water-table aquifer extending across a forest-marsh interface into an adjacent tidal creek that leads to North Inlet (SC). The aquifer is characterized by groundwater flow from the forest recharge area towards the creek. DOC concentrations range from 50 to 140 mg L-1 in the shallow portions of the aquifer below the forest and undergo seasonal changes that are inversely related to temperature and precipitation conditions. Markedly lower DOC concentrations (< 10 mg L-1) in the deep portion of the aquifer are consistent with the loss of a large fraction of the original DOC along the groundwater flow paths. Mass balance estimates indicate that over 60% of the DOC losses are due to sorption reactions whereas the rest appear to be caused by heterotrophic decay. Groundwater DOC discharge from the forest, which occurs in a restricted zone of the high marsh, is 5.5 mg carbon m(-2) d(-1) and accounts for a minor component of the annual carbon export from North Inlet. In contrast, moderately saline (2 - 12 ppt) ground waters below the marsh display elevated DOC concentrations (&SIM;20 mg L-1) that appear to be the result of mixing of fresh ground waters and surface seawater during tidal seepage and concentration during evapotranspiration. The flux of DOC associated with the discharge of these saline ground waters is 600 mg carbon m(-2) d(-1), which represents a significant fraction of the annual DOC budget for North Inlet.

AB  - This year the Montreal Protocol celebrates its 20th Anniversary. In September 1987, 24 countries signed the 'Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer'. Today 191 countries have signed and have met strict commitments on phasing out of ozone depleting substances with the result that a 95% reduction of these substances has been achieved. The Montreal Protocol has also contributed to slowing the rate of global climate change, since most of the ozone depleting substances are also effective greenhouse gases. Even though much has been achieved, the future of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on full compliance of the Montreal Protocol by all countries for the remaining substances, including methyl bromide, as well as strict monitoring of potential risks from the production of substitute chemicals. Also the ozone depleting substances existing in banks and equipment need special attention to prevent their release to the stratosphere. Since many of the ozone depleting substances already in the atmosphere are long-lived, recovery cannot be immediate and present projections estimate a return to pre-1980 levels by 2050 to 2075. It has also been predicted that the interactions of the effects of the ozone layer and that of other climate change factors will become increasingly important.

AB  - The present study explores the use of stable carbon isotopes to trace organic matter sources of intertidal nematodes in the Schelde estuary (SW Netherlands). Stable carbon isotope signatures of nematodes from a saltmarsh and 4 tidal flat stations were determined in spring and winter situations, and compared to isotope ratios of organic matter sources within the estuary. Nematodes collected from fine sandy tidal flat sediments in late spring and during mild and sunny late winter weather had delta(13)C values consistent with microphytobenthos as their prime carbon source. Nematodes from a silty station and individuals sampled under cold and dark winter conditions had delta(13)C values intermediate between those of microalgae and particulate organic matter, The isotopic signatures of nematodes from the saltmarsh station were intermediate between those of microalgae, Spartina anglica-litter and particulate organic matter. An in situ (HCO3-)-C-13 spike experiment at 2 tidal flat stations corroborated the importance of microphytobenthos as a carbon source for nematodes, yet at the same time contradicted the hypothesis that direct grazing would be the main pathway of microalgal carbon to nematode consumers. A laboratory experiment adding C-13-labeled algal detritus to sediment microcosms demonstrated the nematodes' ability to rapidly utilize settling organic matter too. Incorporation of carbon from phytodetritus by subsurface nematodes in both enrichment experiments was high, but, compared to carbon utilization by surface individuals, showed time-lags largely consistent with sediment mixing rates, A combination of observed natural isotope signatures and experimental results suggests that tidal flat nematodes preferentially utilize labile organic carbon derived from microphytobenthos or settling phytoplankton; organic matter from terrestrial or riverine origin does not contribute significantly to the diet of nematodes at our study sites.

AB  - The artificial introduction and rapid expansion of Spartina alterniflora Loisel (S. alterniflora) have greatly changed the natural evolution of tidal flats, especially along the Jiangsu coast, China. The occurrence of an elevation gap at the seaward marsh margin (marsh-edge cliffs) manifests that tidal flats have experienced severe regional erosion and the state transformation from the smooth slope to the stepped profile. However, the mechanisms controlling the formation of marsh-edge cliffs and the state transformation of tidal flats remain elusive while the future evolution of a marsh-cliff-flat system is unclear. Here we show the rapid formation process of marsh-edge cliffs within less than five years in Yancheng Nature Reserve, Jiangsu coast, China, as a fantastic example for the first time, via examining the cross-shore topographic changes during 2008-2014 and investigating sediment characteristics, vegetation biomass, marsh deposition rate, currents and waves during 2013-2014. A one-dimension cross-shore model was used to estimate the relative predominance of waves and currents in response to the variations of tidal flat cross-shore profile and help interpret the formation of marsh-edge cliffs. The fast accretion of the marsh area after the introduction of S. alterniflora (approximately 4.3-5.3 cm/yr) accelerated the seaward shift of marsh margin, narrowing the width of bare flat; meanwhile, reduced sediment supply from offshore triggered the down-cutting of the lower bare flat (e.g., the maximum of about 0.5 mat the mean sea level from 2010 to 2011), strengthening wave actions to erode bare flat landward. These two processes jointly led to the predominance of waves (0.43-0.90 N/m(2)) over currents (mostly <0.40 N/m(2)) on the upper bare flat, which is consistent with the numerical modeling outcomes. As a consequence, the bed slope increased from 0.6%0 in 2008 to 1.0%. in 2014, being vulnerable to wave attacks. The vegetation-root bonding of underlying sediments and the wave breaking at the marsh margin finally facilitated the formation of marsh-edge cliffs during 2011-2013. The cliffs were roughly estimated to retreat 20-110 m during 2013-2014. The future evolution of tidal flat accompanied by the continuous backward shifting of cliffs, the initiation and seaward spread of new marsh area, and the formation of new marsh-edge cliffs, resemble the hysteresis effect, as seaward advance and backward erosion will take almost equivalent time of nearly 9-50 years. This hysteresis effect of tidal flat evolution might further alter the local biological community structure and the pathway of coastal organic carbon flows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present field data and data from the literature to highlight the effects of low-tide rainfall on particulate organic carbon (POC) redistribution in intertidal landscapes. The POC exchanges reported from disparate but related studies were standardized to a storm-induced exchange rate (gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1)) and compared. Results show that these intertidal areas have a characteristic response to rainfall with an average flux of 0.040 +/- 0.038 gPOC m(-2) mmRain(-1). Further, low-tide rainfall can entrain and redistribute 7-54% of annual sedimentary POC accumulation, or 12-75% of annual POC export, based on current outwelling assessments. Finally, we provide a conceptual model describing the variability of rainfall-driven POC exchange through the hierarchical structure of intertidal landscapes and how observations of POC flux can be expected to change across the intertidal landscape. This information should be used to guide sampling strategies for continued intertidal zone rainfall work.

AB  - Despite sedimentation being recognized as a very important process in wetlands, very little is known about its dynamics. This study analyzed sedimentation on a short-term scale in the semiarid floodplain wetland Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park (central Spain). In monthly sampling intervals during 1997 and 1998, we measured seasonal and spatial sedimentation patterns of total solids, organic and mineral matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus using sediment traps. The highest mean mass accumulation rates were obtained at the wetland-input site (135 +/- 57 g m(-2) d(-1)), but a decrease in sedimentation rates was noted with increasing distance from the inflow (49 +/- 39 g m(-2) d(-1) in the terminal zone of the wetland). Flow and water level explained only 13% of variance in sedimentation, The sedimentation patterns presented clear seasonality, coinciding with the period of vegetation growth. There existed a marked spatial heterogeneity in sedimentation that can be attributed to differences in vegetative cover. In vegetated areas, sedimentation of solids was related with nutrient deposition coming from detritus. Sedimentation of mineral matter dominated over the organic fraction. Autochthonous material comprised a very important fraction of accumulated sediment (between 31-57% of mineral matter and 45-65% of organic matter). Sedimentation of autochthonous total phosphorus made up about 90% of total settling phosphorus. Reed (Phragmites australis) and sawgrass (Cladium mariscus) plant cover significantly explained sedimentation of organic matter in the wetland (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.57, respectively). The contribution of phytoplankton primary productivity to total organic carbon sedimentation was negligible and observed only at the deeper sampling stations. The autochthonous mineral matter of the settling seston may originate either from primary precipitation of endogenic calcite and/or rapid mineralization of organic matter on the sediment surface. Accretion rates were very high (1.61-3.87 cm yr(-1)), suggesting that the wetland will silt up within the next century if present rates are maintained. Thus, sedimentation dynamics must be involved in management strategies in order to conserve important wetlands.

AB  - Coastal blue carbon activities are being implemented by a variety of countries, using different approaches. Existing regulatory regimes, including on coastal protection, are still very useful tools to protect and conserve mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, and preserve their carbon value and role. These approaches suffer, however, from traditional' issues such as lack of enforcement, human and financial constraints as well as unclear or misguiding government mandates. Successes are witnessed using a community-based carbon project approach, ensuring high stakeholder participation via direct or indirect incentive programmes. Comprehensive coastal zone management approaches seem very promising, but success overall, and regarding carbon specifically, are yet to be reported. The Paris Agreement has introduced new tools which could serve as means to trigger more and better coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts. Their implementation details are, however, still under negotiation and their impacts can only be expected in a few years.

AB  - Research on biosaline agriculture has been increasing worldwide in recent years. In this respect, the Iberian halophyte diversity present a high-value ecological solution to be implemented for biosaline-based agroecosystems. The research on these halophytic species has been increasing worldwide and, in the recent years, especially in terms saline agriculture adaptation, osmophysiology and nutraceutical potential, highlighting the importance and potential of these species in terms of agrosolutions. The Mediterranean area has high biodiversity in terms of endemic halophytic vegetation (ca. 62 species), providing an alternative pool of potential new agricultural products to be cultivated in adverse conditions. Besides being highly diverse, most of these species are endemic and present a perennial life cycle with several applications in terms of food, forage, nutraceutical, feedstock and remediation. More specifically, the Iberian halophytic flora shows potential as resources of essential fatty acids, minerals and antioxidants-all very important for human and animal nutrition. Alongside the establishment of halophyte agroecological solutions is the provision of key ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and soil rehabilitation. Moreover, halophyte-based ecosystems provide additional recognized ecosystem services, beyond the final product production, by improving soil health, ecosystem biodiversity and storing large amounts of carbon, thereby increasing the ecosystem resilience to climate change and offering a green solution against climate change.

AB  - Oxygen demand, carbon dioxide release and total alkalinity shift were calculated from changes in oxygen, pH and total alkalinity produced by bottom dark incubations at the water-sediment interface of the 3 bottom types identified in a southwest lagoon in New Caledonia. Total sediment oxygen demand (DELTAO2) was corrected from nonbiological oxygen demand (NBOD) in order to obtain the apparent biological activity (DELTAO2-degrees). Total carbon dioxide flux (DELTACO2) was corrected from total alkalinity shift in order to estimate organic carbon processes. The resulting mean carbon dioxide flux (DELTACO2-degrees = 2.58 mmol m-2 h-1, SE = 0.12) exceeded biological oxygen demand (DELTAO2-degrees 1.60 mmol m-2 h-1, SE = 0.08). The highly significant ratio estimates from functional regression lines of DELTACO2-degrees on DELTAO2 and DELTACO2-degrees on DELTAO2-degrees gave a total community respiratory quotient (CRQ) of 1. 17 (SE = 0.06) and an organic respiratory quotient (CRQ-degrees), involving only direct biological processes, of 1.42 (SE = 0.07) for the lagoon. The significance and the use of these ratios are discussed in order to calculate the anaerobic metabolism proportion (40.3 % of total metabolism for an aerobic respiratory quotient of 0.85). Thus, the simultaneous measurement in the field of O2 fluxes and CO2 fluxes, corrected from appropriate alkalinity changes, allows a rapid approach for estimating carbon production at the water-sediment interface of undisturbed communities.

AB  - Biogeochemical process studies and molecular microbiological analyses were applied to assess the effect of invasive Spartina anglica (SA) on organic carbon (C-org) oxidation pathways and microbial community structures in intertidal sediments vegetated by the indigenous marsh plant Suaeda japonica (SJ) and unvegetated mud flats (UMF). Invasive S. anglica possessed 10 times the below-ground biomass of native S. japonica, which was responsible for releasing a substantial amount of labile dissolved organic matter and creating relatively oxidized conditions at the SA site. As a result, microbial metabolic activities measured by rates of anaerobic C-org oxidation, iron reduction (FeR) and sulfate reduction (SR) appeared to be greater at SA site compared with the SJ and UMF sites. SR was the dominant anaerobic respiration pathway at a depth of 0-10 cm for vegetated sediments, but the contribution of FeR to C-org oxidation was exceptionally high in the rhizosphere of the vegetated sites, comprising 60% and 70% of anaerobic C-org oxidation of SA and SJ, respectively. The iron turnover rate at the rhizosphere was 3 times higher at SA site (0.063 d(-1)) compared with the SJ site (0.023 d(-1)), indicating that the denser root system of invasive S. anglica greatly accelerates iron cycling. Bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA genes analysis revealed that members in Desulfuromonadaceae related to the reduction of FeOOH and S-0 were highly abundant at the relatively oxidized SA site, whereas Desulfobulbaceae, which are known as sulfate reducers, were more dominant at the relatively reduced SJ site. Similarly, two sulfur-oxidizing bacteria groups with different eco-physiological strategies thrived in each of the two vegetated sites. Thioprofundaceae in the Gammaproteobacteria were the predominant S-oxidizers at the less-reduced SA site, whereas Sulfurovum in the Epsilonproteobacteria dominated at the relatively reduced SJ site. Our results suggest that an invasion of tall S. anglica and its subsequent displacement of native S. japonica would greatly alter the biogeochemical C-Fe-S cycles and associated microbial communities, which ultimately generate multidirectional variations in ecological and biogeochemical processes in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Due to its geographical situation, Baja California Sur is the most arid Mexican state, with the longest length of coast in the country.  Hence, the study of halophytes for incorporation into rural agriculture is a priority for this region.  In this research, the growth and development of a natural population of the oilseed halophyte Salicornia bigelovii Torr. as affected by environmental factors are analysed.  Four transects were traced in the field, with sample sites of 1 m2 every 3 m along each transect from which samples of soil and plants for laboratory analysis were taken, starting at the lowest seashore tide line.  Edaphic and environmental factors as well as biomass, plant density, size, and dry matter were analysed through multivariate statistical methods.  Three edaphic factors showed correlation with growth and development of individuals:  growth was positively correlated with soil organic matter, and negatively correlated with the percentage of sand as a component of texture and with the balance of sodium (SAR parameter) in the soil saturated paste.  Part of the results are unexpected because most of the previous work had dealt only with the salinity factor.  The results will enable us to determine the next steps to promote the economic use of this species in the study region.

AB  - The extent to which ecological properties of restored coastal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico recover to natural wetland conditions has not been synthesized. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether vegetation and soil parameters at marsh sites restored through sediment addition recovered to levels found at paired reference sites. From 1342 candidate publications, we identified 25 studies (< 1 to > 30 years since initial restoration) suitable for quantitative meta-analysis. Vegetation cover was 50% lower at restored sites compared to reference sites over the first 5 years of restoration while aboveground biomass was 25% higher. On average, belowground parameters (root biomass and soil organic matter) were 44 to 92% lower at restored sites during the first 15 years of restoration compared to reference sites. Mean recovery trajectories for belowground biomass and productivity, vegetation cover, and soil parameters indicated that mean values for restored sites reached reference site conditions within 30 years following restoration. We also evaluated recovery curves for the 20th percentile of site data, which we suggest provides a valuable perspective for natural resource agencies to consider when evaluating individual projects, as it should ensure higher success rates compared with using mean recovery rates to estimate success. Understanding marsh recovery rates following restoration helps future restoration design and monitoring, but recovery rates vary across measurement endpoints. Deciding on the appropriate response(s) to use as the basis of performance measures and monitoring will influence the apparent success of marsh restoration projects.

AB  - We used the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine the food webs of three small floodplain lakes (billabongs) in south-eastern Australia. With few exceptions, stable carbon isotope analysis could not be used to discriminate among the conspicuous potential sources of fringing, emergent or floating vegetation or benthic detritus. These primary sources showed little spatial or temporal variation in delta(13)C values, with means ranging from -28.5 to -26.8% in spring and -29.1 to -25.4% in late summer. Submerged vegetation had similar delta(13)C values to the above sources in spring but showed greater spatial variation and were less C-13- depleted, considerably so in some species, in late summer. Epiphytes and algae were C-13-depleted in spring compared with the other primary sources but became more C-13-enriched in late summer. Mean delta(13)C values for primary and secondary consumers were not only far more variable (-37.4 to -22.7%) but in general were more negative than the potential food sources, particularly in spring. Using the combined information from stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis, we could narrow down the list of potential primary sources driving food webs in these billabongs. The freshwater crayfish (Cherax) was one of the few taxa that appeared to obtain its biomass carbon from detrital material. Gastropods and leptocerid caddis larvae on emergent or submerged vegetation obtained a mixture of carbon from epiphytes and macrophytes; in both taxa, epiphytes contributed more to biomass carbon than did the macrophytes. However, other common grazers and collector/ gatherers sampled from macrophytes, e.g. baetid mayflies, chironomid larvae and atyid shrimps, were often too C-13-depleted even to have derived their biomass carbon solely from epiphytes. Many other primary consumers, including zooplankton, and mussels (Velesunio), and most of the secondary consumers, including water mites (Hydracarina), phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus) and fish, were also C-13-depleted. The enormous biomass of littoral and fringing vegetation could contribute to metazoan food webs in these billabongs only if an additional highly C-13-depleted source was consumed simultaneously. Methane released from billabong sediments could provide such a C-13-depleted carbon source that is reintroduced into metazoan food webs via the consumption of methanotrophic bacteria. Alternatively, food webs in these water bodies are largely driven by an unknown and inconspicuous C-13-depleted primary producer, such as planktonic Chlorophyta.

AB  - Tidal wetlands experiencing increased rates of sea-level rise (SLR) must increase rates of soil elevation gain to avoid permanent conversion to open water. The maximal rate of SLR that these ecosystems can tolerate depends partly on mineral sediment deposition, but the accumulation of organic matter is equally important for many wetlands. Plant productivity drives organic matter dynamics and is sensitive to global change factors, such as rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. It remains unknown how global change will influence organic mechanisms that determine future tidal wetland viability. Here, we present experimental evidence that plant response to elevated atmospheric [ CO2] stimulates biogenic mechanisms of elevation gain in a brackish marsh. Elevated CO2 (ambient + 340 ppm) accelerated soil elevation gain by 3.9 mm yr(-1) in this 2-year field study, an effect mediated by stimulation of below-ground plant productivity. Further, a companion greenhouse experiment revealed that the CO2 effect was enhanced under salinity and flooding conditions likely to accompany future SLR. Our results indicate that by stimulating biogenic contributions to marsh elevation, increases in the greenhouse gas, CO2, may paradoxically aid some coastal wetlands in counterbalancing rising seas.

AB  - With an aim to determine whether Spartina alterniflora actively changes the habitat environment, thus facilitating its successful competition over native species, a field experiment was carried out at the Jiuduansha Wetland National Nature Reserve. Sulfur concentrations in the soil sediments were compared among wetlands dominated by the exotic Spartina alterniflora, the co-occurring native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. The results show that the soil sulfur concentrations in the Spartina alterniflora community showed significant spatiotemporal variability with the years since invasion. The S. alterniflora community contained the highest concentrations of sulfur in the soil sediment. Moreover, the sulfur concentrations were higher in the initial invasion area than at the edges of the invading area. The was little difference in soil sulfur concentrations between communities containing native species S. mariqueter and unvegetated mudflat. There were significant correlations between soil sulfur concentrations and carbon and nitrogen concentrations; the soil nitrogen concentrations were negatively correlated with the sulfur concentrations, and the carbon concentrations were positively correlated with the sulfur concentrations. In different seasons, the concentration of sulfur is relatively higher in spring than which in other seasons. Furthermore, the sulfur concentrations at different soil depths also exhibited significant changes with depths. In addition, the soil sulfur concentrations associated with S. alterniflora also showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with depth, the soil sulfur concentrations in S. alterniflora soils were obviously higher than those in the S. mariqueter community and unvegetated mudflat, the maximum concentrations in S. alterniflora soils occurred at the depth of 40-60 cm. The findings of this study indicate that S. alterniflora increases wetland sulfur storage, which may explain the mechanism of expansion of S. alterniflora in the Jiuduansha Wetland.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are significant components of the coastal landscape with important roles in ecosystem service provision and mitigation of climate change. They are also likely to be the system most impacted by climate change, feeling the effects of sea levels rise, temperature increases and rainfall regime changes. Climate change impacts on estuarine coastal wetlands (mangroves, saltmarsh) have been thoroughly investigated; however, the impacts on coastal freshwater wetlands (CFWs) are relatively unknown. To explore the current knowledge of the impacts of climate change on CFWs globally, we undertook a systematic quantitative literature review of peer-reviewed published literature. We found surprisingly little research (110 papers of an initial 678), the majority of which was conducted in the USA, focusing on the effects of sea level rise (SLR) on CFW vegetation or sediment accretion processes. From this research, we know that SLR will lead to reduced productivity, reduced regeneration, and increased mortality in CFW vegetation but little is known regarding the effects of other climate change drivers. Sediment accretion is also not sufficient to keep pace with SLR in many CFWs and again the effects of other climate drivers have not been investigated. The combination of unhealthy vegetation communities and minimal gain in vertical elevation can result in a transition towards a vegetation community of salt-tolerant species but more research is required to understand this process.

AB  - Crude oil exploration and production has been the largest anthropogenic factor contributing to the degradation of Momoge Wetland, China. To study the effects of crude oil on wetland soils, we examined the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), as well as pH and electricity conductivity (EC) from oil sites and uncontaminated areas in the Momoge Wetland. All contaminated areas had significantly higher (p < 0.05) contents of TPH and TOC, but significantly lower (p < 0.05) TN contents than those of the uncontaminated areas. Contaminated sites also exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) pH values, C/N and C/P ratios. For TP contents and EC, no significant changes were detected. The level of soil contamination and impact of oil residuals on soil quality greatly depended on the length of time the oil well was in production. Oil residuals had caused some major changes in the soils' chemical properties in the Momoge Wetland.

AB  - A study of the spatial distribution and abundance of fiddler crabs was carried out in Guaratuba Bay, Parana State, southern Brazil. Fiddler crabs were collected from 10 biotopes located along a salinity gradient from zero to 32 inside Guaratuba Bay (between 48 degrees 30 degrees W-25 degrees 50'S and 48 degrees 45'W-25 degrees 54'S). Seven species were found, among which, Uca mordax (Smith, 1870) occurred only in biotopes inundated by low salinity water, from zero to 16. Remaining species tolerated wide range of salinity oscillation, but Uca maracoani (Latreille, 1802-1803) and Uca leptodactyla Rathbun, 1898 predominated in saltier waters, from 14 to 32, while U. burgersi Holthuis, 1967, Uca rapax (Smith, 1870), Uca thayeri Rathbun, 1900, and Uca uruguayensis Nobili, 1901 were collected in more than three biotopes and showed to be euryhaline: they tolerated salinities from 4 to 32. However, other soil characteristics such as pebble/ sand/ silt/ clay balance, organic matter content and presence of seagrass also influenced the spatial distribution of these crabs. U. leptodactyla occurred with maximum density of 240 ind.m(-2), a highest recorded value.

AB  - 1. Knowledge about processes and dynamics underlying organic matter accumulation in transitional waters is crucial for the protection of these ecologically important coastal habitats. This study investigated the relationship between large particle accumulation and decomposition in a coastal lake included in a Site of Community Interest (SCI) using sediment trap and litterbag techniques.
   2. Two sets of sediment traps were deployed at five sites along the longitudinal axis of the lake. One set was emptied once a month for 12 months, and the other twice a year. The contents of the monthly and the 6-monthly traps and the superficial sediments were then compared to estimate the organic matter accumulation and loss. To determine the mass loss rate of the three major allochthonous sources of detritus (the reed Phragmites australis, the cordgrass Spartina juncea, and the seagrass Posidonia oceanica), litterbags were placed near the sediment traps at three out of the five sites at the beginning of each 6-month period and retrieved monthly.
   3. The amount of annual particulate organic matter (POM) deposition in the traps was 1320.2 +/- 58.5 g m(-2) y(-1) and consisted of 25% large particles (CPOM). Allochthonous litter comprised an important fraction of CPOM, and its breakdown rate changed with the plant species, site and season. Loss rate of CPOM accumulated at the lake bottom was significantly related with the mass loss rate of reed and cordgrass litter, but not with that of seagrass.
   4. Due to slow litter breakdown and tidal landward advection, the lake acted as a sediment trap for allochthonous matter, especially from Posidonia. The important role of marine-derived litter in organic matter sedimentation suggests addressing conservation strategies of the lake functioning towards the selective control of allochthonous CPOM inputs, in particular at the mouth where the incoming tide brings suspended material and salinity decelerates matter flow to the sea and decomposition. This study supports the hypothesis that sedimentation and decomposition dynamics are important factors for coastal lake evolution, and shows litterbag and sediment trap techniques as simple useful investigation tools in management strategies aiming at conserving transitional waters.

AB  - Seasonal and spatial variations of dissolved and particulate methylmercury were evaluated for the first time in sediment cores from the Tagus Estuary.
   Results showed the highest MeHg concentrations in summer months indicating that the "seasonally" methylation process occurs not only at the topmost layers of the sediments but also in the deeper layers of the sediment column.
   The proportion of MeHg (up to 92%) in some of our pore water samples was higher than values reported in the literature for other estuaries suggesting that the sedimentary environment in the Tagus tends to favour Hg methylation.
   This work points to the importance of seasonal variation of the MeHg production in sediment cores. In physically dominated estuaries this enhances seasonal MeHg production in deeper sediments that can have serious ecological impacts due to resuspension or advection processes under extreme events by the increase of MeHg transported to the water column.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is essential to evaluate the effects of wetland restoration projects. A monitoring program before and after restoration has been carried out in the study area located in the Yellow River Delta since 2001. Water quality, soil salinity. soil organic matter, plant community. and bird species were chosen as indicators in this program. During the past seven years, the restored wetland showed increasing efficiency in reducing water pollution levels. Soil quality was constantly improved through salinity reduction and soil organic matter accumulation. The vegetation community quickly re-established after the restoration was initiated in 2002. The restored vegetation communities provide favorable habitat conditions for birds and thirty-seven bird species were observed in October 2007. Based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plant species and vegetation community are mainly influenced by soil salinity and water depth. These indicate that conducting freshwater to the project area is an efficient measure for vegetation restoration. While monitoring results show that the restoration project had positive effects on the wetland ecosystem over the past seven years, two issues remain for future study: (1) the contribution of harvesting vegetation to stabilizing nutrient removal rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter in the soil; and (2) the effects of excessive propagation of Phragmites australis on spatial heterogeneity and plant diversity.

AB  - High sedimentation rates and high organic matter contents promote the development of anoxic conditions in the Ria de Vigo (NW Spain). In these anoxic environments, elements such as S, Fe, and Mn are involved in redox processes affecting the CH4 dynamic. In this work, speciation of S, Fe, and Mn was evaluated through a five-step sequential extraction procedure (exchangeable form and bound to carbonate, present in the reductive phase bound to Fe/Mn oxides, weakly bound to organic matter, strongly bound to organic matter, and residual fractions) in order to identify the origin of S, Fe, and Mn, distinguishing between fractions bound to organic compounds from those in the sulfide phase in these anoxic sediments. The study was conducted on samples from three gravity cores retrieved in the inner and outer zones of the ria in November 2012. S was mainly found in the fraction strongly bound to organic matter, showing that S is incorporated in the organic matter. However, the S in this fraction was associated with total organic carbon only in the inner zone (r = 0.833). More than 65% of total Fe and Mn was found in the residual fraction at all zones, being the highest in the outer zone, and showing an intense diagenesis in the ria, where precipitation of these elements as sulfides is favored by anoxic conditions. SO42- reduction, Fe and Mn reduction processes coexist in the same area within the cores.

AB  - Along a trophic gradient from the head of an estuary to the open ocean, carbon isotope ratios were determined both in tissues of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas and in different components of the oysters' potential food resource. In the study area, the Marennes-Oleron Bay (France), a gradient in delta(13)C occurred in the particulate organic carbon (POC) from riverine (-29.2- -27.4 parts per thousand) to open sea littoral (-21.8- -19.5 parts per thousand). Isotope composition of oysters collected along this estuarine gradient followed a similar trend, indicating a predominant contribution of organic matter derived from terrestrial detritus to the diet of C. gigas inhabiting the upper estuarine reaches. A remarkable departure from this general pattern was noted in the isotope composition of oysters sampled from a reef, at the mouth of the Charente river. These oysters exhibited enriched C-13 composition, suggesting that they were largely feeding upon benthic microalgae (-16 parts per thousand) from an adjacent wide mudflat. The reported results suggest that C. gigas is able to preferentially ingest and/or assimilate particular food sources (i.e, benthic diatoms) among diverse sources within the total organic matter pool.

AB  - In theory, carbon is highly mobile in aquatic systems. Recent evidence from carbon stable isotopes of crabs (Parasesarma erythrodactyla and Australoplax tridentata), however, shows that in subtropical Australian waters, measurable carbon movement between adjacent mangrove and saltmarsh habitats is limited to no more than a few metres. We tested whether the pattern in crab delta C-13 values across mangrove and saltmarsh habitats was explained by crab movement, or the movement of particulate organic matter. We estimated crab movement in a mark-recapture program using an array of pitfall traps on 13 transects (a total of 65 traps) covering an area of 600 m(2) across the interface of these two habitats. Over a 19-day period, the majority of crabs (91% for P. erythrodactyla, 93% for A. tridentata) moved < 2 m from the place of initial capture. Crab movement cannot, therefore, explain the patterns in delta C-13 values of crabs. delta C-13 values of detritus collected at 2-m intervals across the same habitat interface fitted a sigmoidal curve of a similar form to that fitting the delta C-13 values of crabs. delta C-13 values of detritus were 2-4 parts per thousand more depleted in saltmarsh (-18.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand), and 4-7 parts per thousand more depleted in mangroves (-25.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) than delta C-13 values of crabs recorded previously in each habitat. Assimilation by crabs of very small detrital fragments or microphytobenthos, more enriched in C-13, may explain the disparity in delta C-13 values. Nevertheless, the pattern in delta C-13 values of detritus suggests that crabs obtain their carbon from up to several metres away, but without themselves foraging more then a metre or so from their burrow. Such detailed measurements of carbon movement in estuaries provide a spatially explicit understanding of the functioning of food webs in saltmarsh and mangrove habitats.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion and inundation can affect soil microbial activity, which regulates the carbon (C) balance in mangroves and helps to determine if these coastal forests can keep pace with sea level rise (SLR). This study evaluated the effects of increased salinity (+15 ppt), increased inundation (-8 cm), and their combination, on soil organic C loss from a mangrove peat soil (Everglades, Florida, USA) under simulated tides. Soil respiration (CO2 flux), methane (CH4) flux, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and porewater nutrient concentrations were quantified. Soil respiration was the major pathway of soil organic C loss (94-98%) and was approximately 90% higher in the control water level than the inundated treatment under elevated salinity. Respiration rate increased with water temperature, but depended upon salinity and tidal range. CH4 flux was minimal, while porewater DOC increased with a concomitant, significant decline in soil bulk density under increased inundation. Porewater ammonium increased (73%) with inundation and soluble reactive phosphorus increased (32%) with salinity. Overall, the decline in soil organic C mineralization from combined saltwater intrusion and prolonged inundation was not significant, but results suggest SLR could increase this soil's susceptibility to peat collapse and accelerate nutrient and DOC export to adjacent Florida Bay.

AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) is an important component in the carbon cycle of estuarine systems. Many studies have utilized carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13-POC) to estimate the origin of POC. Most of the early studies were restricted to areas of minimum terrestrial inputs of POC, whereas later studies used multiple stable isotope analysis. In our study, we assess the proportion of POC from C-3 and C-4 plants and microalgae in two terrestrially affected, contrasting estuaries of the southeastern U.S.A.: the Altamaha (Piedmont) and the Satilla (blackwater) Rivers. Our analysis was based on a mass balance equation, taking into consideration the estimated amounts of microalgae and C-3 and C-4 plant material. Analysis of delta C-13 Of extracted chlorophyll a (Chl a) was used to estimate the isotopic signature of microalgae to constrain the three endmember mass balance. The maximum concentration of POC fluctuated between 9 and 11 mg C L-1, coinciding with the period of maximum riverine flow. The POC represented 50-70% of the total organic carbon. However, large fluctuations were observed, suggesting important tidal- and wind-driven resuspension. The delta C-13-POC ranged from -21 to -28 parts per thousand, being more depleted at lower salinities. This indicates rapid dilution of terrestrially derived material with estuarine- or marine-derived material. The Chi a concentration was maximal during summer in upstream stations of the Altamaha estuary, while the Satilla generally showed a midestuary maximum. The delta C-13 of Chi a ranged from -20.7 to -31.43 parts per thousand, indicating isotopically depleted inputs of microalgal-derived material (MaDM). Our results suggest that MaDM is the dominant component of POC in the Altamaha River during summer, whereas the C-3 component is dominant during periods of lower productivity and high flushing. Although MaDM is significant in the Satilla estuary, most of the POC consists of material derived from C-3 and C-4 plants.

AB  - The sources of organic matter (OM) in surface sediments from Wilson Inlet, an enclosed and seasonally barred inlet in Western Australia, have been determined using a combination of lipid biomarkers (including fatty acids, sterols, phytol, long chain alcohols, alkyl diols, tetrahymanol and C-32 hopanol) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data for bulk OM and delta C-13 data for n-alkanols. The organic composition of sediments from the inflowing rivers was used as a proxy for terrestrial inputs of higher plant OM, since these sediments contained only small amounts of carbon from microalgae (mostly diatoms), bacteria and cyanobacteria. The relative proportions of "marine" and "terrestrial" OM in the sediments could be estimated using the stable carbon isotope signature of the bulk organic carbon. The sediments from Wilson Inlet showed similar lipid compositions and isotope values, and the sterol and fatty acid distributions showed the complexity typical of marine ecosystems. Relative contributions from algal (phytoplankton and microphytobenthos), bacterial, terrestrial plants and seagrass sources were estimated using biomarker/organic carbon ratios in the different source terms. Microalgae and bacteria are the most important source of OM within the inlet (over 80% in most sediments) and most of the algal material originates from the water column, except in sandy shallow sediments at the eastern end of the inlet where a contribution from microphytobenthos can be discerned. The distributions, abundances and delta C-13 isotope values of long chain n-alkanols proved to be useful in quantifying the contributions from terrestrial plants and the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa. The latter is a relatively small contributor (< 10%) to the OM in the sediments, despite the presence of large seagrass beds around the edges of the inlet and the presumed importance of seagrass as a source of carbon in the foodwebs of the inlet. Nonetheless, seagrass is a significant contributor of the "higher plant" marker 24-ethylcholesterol (sitosterol) in the sediments. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to follow the uptake and allocation of N in different plant functional types and microbes in two tundra ecosystems differing in nutrient availability, we performed a N-15-labeling experiment with three N forms and followed the partitioning of N-15 label among plants, microorganisms and soil organic matter. At both sites the deciduous dwarf shrub Betula nana and the evergreen Empetrum hermaphroditum absorbed added N-15 at rates in the order: NH4+ > NO3- > glycine, in contrast to the graminoid Carex species which took up added N-15 at rates in the order NO3- > NH4+ > glycine. Carex transported a high proportion of N-15 to aboveground parts, whereas the dwarf shrubs allocated most N-15 to underground storage. Enhanced C-13 in Betula nana roots represents the first field evidence of uptake of intact glycine by this important circumpolar plant. Plant and microbial uptake of label was complementary as plants took up more inorganic than organic N, while microbes preferred organic N. Microbes initially took up a large part of the added label, but over the following four weeks microbial N-15 decreased by 50% and most N-15 was recovered in soil organic matter, while a smaller but slowly increasing proportion was retained in plant biomass.

AB  - Normalized biomass size spectra (NBSS) and the stable nitrogen isotopic composition of food webs were analyzed to determine the inter-specific relationships between trophic level (measured as delta N-15) and body size in macrobenthic communities living on the continental shelf of the southeastern Weddell Sea (SEWS). We found that the relationship between trophic level and body size for the whole macrobenthic community was not significant (r(2) = 0.08, p > 0.05), probably associated with biomass accumulated in the larger body size fractions, which are represented particularly by suspension feeders such as sponges and tunicates. We used an alternative method of studying trophic structure of the aquatic communities based on the distribution of residuals of the NBSS. Here we demonstrate how residual distribution exhibited dome-like patterns, which may offer an additional quantitative tool for studying the relationship between trophic level and body size. These domes of biomass represent trophic positions derived from relationships between the body size distribution of the predators in one trophic position and their prey in another. We found 4 well defined domes of biomass, which appear when large benthic species are abundant, especially favored in an environment with high organic matter flux. A significant positive relationship (r(2) = 0.59, p < 0.05) between the trophic level and residuals derived from NBSS suggests that these domes might be considered as functional groups comprising organisms from different trophic levels. We suggest that dome-like patterns in the biomass size spectra can provide a robust framework for conceptualizing and statistically modeling trophic levels of macrobenthic communities.

AB  - Metal accumulation by Juncus maritimus and the role of this plant on the physical and chemical composition of sediments, from the Douro river estuary(NW Portugal),were investigated. The contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were determined (by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in sediments, rhizosediments (those among plant roots and rhizomes), and different plant tissues (roots, rhizomes, leaves, and stems). Metal fractionation in sediments through sequential extraction was carried out and used for interpretation of sediment/J. maritimus interactions. Two estuarine sites with different characteristics were studied: site I displayed sandy sediment with lower organic matter and metals more weakly bound to it than site II sediment, which was muddy. At both sites, higher metal contents were observed in rhizosediments than in the surrounding sediment, but metals were more weakly bound to rhizosediment. Therefore, J. maritimus markedly influenced the sediments among its roots and rhizomes, changing metal distribution and speciation. Different patterns of both metal uptake and metal distribution among J. maritimus tissues were observed at the two sites. Plant bioaccumulation was only observed for Cd, Cu, and Zn, being similar for Cd at the two sites and significantly higher for Cu and Zn (9 and 4 times higher, respectively) at site I. In conclusion, J. maritimus was shown to have potential for phytoextraction (or phytostabilization) of Cd, Cu, and Zn in estuarine environment. However, an eventual application of J. maritimus for this purpose will require a periodic removal of the plants together with their own rhizosediment.

AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns in the basal resources fueling the macrobenthic food web of a temperate coastal embayment subject to a low-turbidity riverine discharge (Gwangyang Bay, Korea) were evaluated using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study examined trophic links of macrobenthic food web with primary production in diverse wetland habitats along the riverine-estuarine-coastal marine continuum. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of macrobenthic assemblages collected along the salinity gradient of the main channel and their putative sources of organic matter (i.e., riverine particulate organic matter (RPOM), Phragmites australis, microphytobenthos (MPB), phytoplankton, and Zostera marina) were determined. A permutational analysis of variance test showed seasonal uniformity in the isotopic niches of the macrobenthic community within different channel locations. In contrast, isotopic nestedness calculated for the microbenthic community emphasized clearly different trends in its isotopic niches among locations. The delta C-13 values of phytoplankton, suspended and sedimentary organic matter, and macrobenthic community displayed a consistently positive relationship with salinity, characterizing an important contribution of local phytoplankton to the nutrition of macrobenthic community. The isotope mixing model revealed that Phragmites-derived organic matter contributed considerably to the nutrition in the estuarine channel, whereas MPB and Zostera provided trophic subsidies to the deep bay and offshore communities. The nutritional importance of RPOM was minimal at all sites. Overall results suggest that phytoplankton production is a major nutritional contributor to the macrobenthic community in the main channel and that trapping POM originated from neighboring wetlands leads to a longitudinal isotopic niche shift in the macrobenthic community.

AB  - While growth history of vegetation within upland systems is well studied, plant phenology within coastal tidal systems is less understood. Landscape-scale, satellite-derived indicators of plant greenness may not adequately represent seasonality of vegetation biomass and productivity within tidal wetlands due to limitations of cloud cover, satellite temporal frequency, and attenuation of plant signals by tidal flooding. However, understanding plant phenology is necessary to gain insight into aboveground biomass, photosynthetic activity, and carbon sequestration. In this study, we use a modeling approach to estimate plant greenness throughout a year in tidal wetlands located within the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. We used variables such as EVI history, temperature, and elevation to predict plant greenness on a 14-day timestep. We found this approach accurately estimated plant greenness, with larger error observed within more dynamic restored wetlands, particularly at early post-restoration stages. We also found modeled EVI can be used as an input variable into greenhouse gas models, allowing for an estimate of carbon sequestration and gross primary production. Our strategy can be further developed in future research by assessing restoration and management effects on wetland phenological dynamics and through incorporating the entire Sentinel-2 time series once it becomes available within Google Earth Engine.

AB  - Present-day habitats of the Ebro Delta, NE Iberian Peninsula, have been ecologically altered as a consequence of intensive human impacts in the last two centuries (especially rice farming). Benthic foraminiferal palaeoassemblages and sediment characteristics of five short cores were used to reconstruct past wetland habitats, through application of multivariate DCA and CONISS techniques, and dissimilarity coefficients (SCD). The timing of environmental changes was compared to known natural and anthropogenic events in order to identify their possible relationships. In deltaic wetlands under altered hydrological conditions, we found a decrease in species diversity and calcareous-dominated assemblages, and a significant positive correlation between microfaunal changes and organic matter content. Modern analogues supported palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the recent evolution of the Delta wetlands. This research provides the first recent reconstruction of change in the Ebro Delta wetlands, and also illustrates the importance of benthic foraminifera for biomonitoring present and future conditions in Mediterranean deltas.

AB  - Sulphate reduction was investigated over 24 h cycles in Zostera marina-bearing sediments. The experiments were carried out at the beginning (April) and end (August) of the growing season of the eelgrass. The sulphate reduction rates were 3 times higher in August (similar to 90 mmol SO42- m(-2) d(-1)) than in April. In both periods, the sulphate reduction rates were significantly higher in the light than in the dark. The stimulation in the light may be due to increased root exudation of organic matter related to photosynthetic activity. The exuded organic carbon accounted for approximately 2 to 4% of the total amount of carbon fixed by the plants. The sulphate reduction rates responded rapidly to shifts from dark to light and vice versa, indicating the presence of a limited pool of labile organic matter in the sediment. A positive correlation between sulphate reduction rates and root+rhizome biomass was observed in April and August during the daytime and in August but not April in the dark.

AB  - Environmental variables as well as methanogenic abundance and activity were analysed in selected human impacted regions of Ashtamudi estuary. Sediment samples were collected during summer and monsoon of 2013. Each was analysed for environmental variables such as temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, sulphate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, organic carbon, organic matter and redox potential. Abundance and methanogenic potential of two distinct groups of methanogenic archaea (i.e. aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogens) were quantified by incubating the sediment samples in basal media, added with acetate or methanol as substrate. Most of the environmental variables showed significant differences spatially and temporally. Among the environmental variables, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and salinity were higher during summer, while total kjeldahl nitrogen, sulphate and organic carbon were higher during monsoon. Abundance of both aceticlastic and methylotrophic methanogens showed significant variations both spatially and temporally. Aceticlastic methanogens were abundant during monsoon, with a maximum value of 810 +/- 13 CFU g(-1), and methylotrophic methanogens were abundant during summer, with a maximum value of 1770 +/- 30 CFU g(-1). Results of methanogenic potential of sediment samples showed a range of 0.01 +/- 0.00 to 12.03 +/- 035 mol m(-3). Among the two substrates, methanol favoured the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens, while acetate induced the methanogenic activity. Methanogenic activity was higher during monsoon than summer that can be attributed to the favourable sedimentary conditions (like reduced redox potential and increased substrate availability). Aceticlastic methanogens were abundant at bottom layers and methylotrophic methanogens in top layers of the sediments. The results of canonical correspondence analysis revealed the existence of linear relationship between methanogenic archaea and environmental variables among the sampling stations. Higher values of salinity, electrical conductivity and total kjeldahl nitrogen favoured the distribution and abundance of aceticlastic methanogens. However, the abundance of methylotrophic methanogens was favoured by highly reduced conditions and high pH values. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain, USA, are managed through a combination of fall or winter burning and structural marsh management(i.e., levees and water control structures; hereafter SMM). The goals of winter burning and SMM include improvement of waterfowl and furbearer habitat, maintenance of historic isohaline lines, and creation and maintenance of emergent wetlands. Although management practices are intended to influence the plant community, effects of these practices on primary productivity have not been investigated. Marsh processes, such as vertical accretion and nutrient cycles, which depend on primary productivity may be affected directly or indirectly by winter burning or SMM. We compared Chenier Plain plant community characteristics (species composition and above- and belowground biomass) in experimentally burned and unburned control plots within impounded and unimpounded marshes at 7 months (1996), 19 months (1997), and 31 months (1998) after burning. Burning and SMM did not affect number of plant species or species composition in our experiment. For ail three years combined, burned plots had higher live above-ground biomass than did unburned plots. Total aboveground and dead above-ground biomasses were reduced in burned plots for two and three years, respectively compared to those in unburned control plots. During all three years, belowground biomass was lower in impounded than in unimpounded marshes but did not differ between burn treatments. Our results clearly indicate that current marsh management practices influence marsh primary productivity and may impact other marsh processes, such as vertical accretion, that are dependent on organic matter accumulation and decay.

AB  - Tidal wetland restoration through dike removal can enhance coastal ecosystem services, such as flood attenuation, fish production, and carbon sequestration. However, landscape-level heterogeneity may influence recovery. For a 169-ha restoration project in Tillamook Bay, Oregon, we hypothesized that areas of more intensive pre-restoration land use/land cover (cropping, grazing) would differ more from reference conditions before restoration than less-intensive uses and that initial post-restoration recovery would vary by land-use/land-cover type and wetland elevation. Before the restoration, the project site overall had higher non-native plant cover, lower elevation and groundwater levels, and lower soil pH than reference high marsh, with some differences by land-use/land-cover type. The cropped and grazed areas were strongly dominated by non-native species, such asPhalaris arundinacea, and were 74 and 31 cm lower than reference high marsh. Less intensively managed areas had elevations intermediate to the cropped and grazed areas and a trend towards higher native plant cover. The restoration led to higher dry-season groundwater levels, increased soil salinity to mesohaline conditions, and a 10-fold increase in soil pH at the project site, while reducing total plant cover. The degree of pre- to early post-restoration change for some parameters differed by land-use/land-cover type (total and non-native plant cover) and by wetland elevation (soil salinity, pH, and accretion rate; and total and non-native plant cover). Our results suggest that pre-restoration heterogeneity in elevation and land cover/land use may influence early post-restoration recovery. Restoration planning can incorporate such spatial variability into management targets and interventions for specific outcomes.

AB  - Recent air-to-sea CO2 flux measurements at several major continental shelves suggest that shelves may act as a one-way pump and absorb atmospheric CO2 into the ocean. The U. S. South Atlantic Bight (SAB) contrasts these findings in that it acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere while simultaneously exporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the open ocean. The shelf-wide heterotrophy and carbon exports in the SAB are subsidized by the export of organic carbon from the abundant intertidal marshes, which are a sink for atmospheric CO2. It is proposed here that the SAB represents a marsh-dominated heterotrophic ocean margin as opposed to river-dominated autotrophic margins. Based on this and other studies, DIC export flux from margins to the open ocean must be significant in the overall global ocean carbon budget.

AB  - Optical measurements using ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometric sensors and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) sensors have recently been used as proxies of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in streams and rivers at a high temporal resolution. Despite the merits of the sensors, temperature changes and particulate matter in water can interfere with the sensor readings, over-or underestimating DOC concentrations. However, little efforts have been made to compare responses of the two types of the sensors to critical interferences such as temperature and turbidity. The performance of a UV-VIS sensor and an FDOM sensor was compared in both laboratory experiments and in situ monitoring in a forest stream in Korea during three storm events. Although the UV-VIS sensor did not require temperature correction in laboratory experiments using the forest stream water, the deviations of its values from the DOC concentrations measured with a TOC analyzer increased linearly as turbidity increased. In contrast, the FDOM sensor outputs decreased significantly as temperature or turbidity increased, requiring temperature and turbidity correction for in situ monitoring of DOC concentrations. The results suggest that temperature correction is relatively straightforward but turbidity correction may not be simple because the attenuation of light by particles can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the sensors in highly turbid waters. Shifts in composition of fluorophores also need to be carefully tracked using periodically collected samples since light absorbance and fluorescence can vary as the concentrations of dominant fluorophores change.

AB  - Top soils (0-10 cm) were collected in three sampling belts during four seasons in 2014, including bare land (HN1), Calamagrostis epigeios (HN2), Typha orientalis (HN3), Phragmites australis (HN4), Tamarix chinensis (HN5) and Suaeda salsa (HN6) along a water and salinity gradient in the Yellow River Delta, China. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), total sulfur (TS) and their ecological stoichiometry were measured to investigate their seasonal and horizontal distribution patterns, as well as their important influencing factors such as electric conductivity (EC) and water content (WC). Our results showed that the contents of SOC and TN exhibited similar changing tendency along the water and salinity gradient. The TP contents followed the order HN5 approximate to HN2 > HN3 approximate to HN6 > HN4 > HN1. TS levels generally increased with increasing salinity from HN1 to HN6. The higher levels of SOC and TP were mostly observed in October and August, respectively, while the seasonal variations in TN were heterogeneous under different plant covers. TS contents were lower in August compared with other sampling periods except for HN4. The mean values of the C/N, C/P and C/S ratios along a water-salinity gradient ranged from 26 to 72, 20 to 74, and 61 to 292, respectively. Generally, higher C/P ratios were observed in sampling sites with plant covers in October expect for HN1, whereas they were lower in January or August. SOC, TN and TP were significantly positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM), silt, WC and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (p < 0.05), whereas TS showed a positive correlation with EC and cations content (p > 0.05). Bulk density (BD) had a great influence on C/N ratio, C/P ratio were mainly effected by SOM, EC and silt, while C/S ratio showed a significant negative correlation with BD, EC, K+, Na+, and Mg2+ (p < 0.05).

AB  - In a general theoretical ecosystem model, we investigate the conditions under which herbivores increase primary production and lead to grazing optimization through recycling of a limiting nutrient.
   Analytical and simulation studies of the model lead to several general results. Grazing optimization requires that (1) the proportion of nutrient lost along the herbivore pathway be sufficiently smaller than the proportion of nutrient lost throughout the rest of the ecosystem; and that (2) inputs of nutrient into the system be greater than a threshold value, which depends on the sensitivity of plant uptake rate to an increase in soil mineral nutrient. An increase in nutrient turnover rate is not sufficient to explain grazing optimization in the long term. When a nutrient is the single limiting factor, plant biomass and productivity at equilibrium are determined only by the balance of ecosystem inputs and outputs of nutrient. Processes that do not have an impact on these inputs or outputs have no effect on primary producers.
   On the other hand, turnover rates are important for the transient dynamics of the system, and the equilibrium analysis is relevant only if it can be reached in a reasonable time scale. The equilibrium is not reached by a compartment with a very slow turnover rate, such as the resistant soil organic matter, before several centuries. On a small time scale, such a compartment can be considered constant, and the trend of the system is predicted with a simplified system.
   The results at equilibrium are insensitive to the functional form used to describe herbivore consumption: the results obtained for simple, linear, donor-controlled herbivory also apply to most forms of more realistic, recipient-controlled herbivory.
   We conclude that grazing optimization is most likely to occur in systems with large losses of the limiting nutrient during recycling of plant detritus, or where herbivores bring nutrient from outside the ecosystem considered (which acts to reduce, or even make negative, the fraction of nutrient lost along the herbivore detritus pathway).

AB  - The exotic species Spartina alterniflora has recently rapidly expanded in the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve. As a result, many technologies to control this organism have been developed. To clarify the effects of S. alterniflora invasion as well as the controlling technologies on the organic carbon reservation capability of the Chongming Dongtan Wetland, variations in soil microbial respiration (SMR) after S. alterniflora invasion and the implementation of different controlling technologies in Chongming Dongtan were analyzed, and their influencing mechanisms were studied by analyzing the soil and plant litter characteristics. The results showed that the SMR of S. alterniflora rhizosphere was 1.87 times (P = 0.000 < 0.05) higher than that of the Phragmites communis rhizosphere, but that their annual organic matter input was almost identical. These findings implied that the organic carbon reservation capability of the S. ahead-flora wetland was lower than that of the native P. communis wetland. S. alterniflora stalks more easily decayed into soil than P. communis stalks due to their lower lignin content and C/N ratio. This resulted in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and TN content in soil of the S. alterniflora rhizosphere, which likely promoted microbial activities, thereby accelerating SMR and organic carbon output. In addition, three artificial measures for controlling the spread of S. alterniflora were found to generally improve the soil microbial activities, thereby increasing organic carbon output when compared to the control. However, when compared to other measures, the effects of mowing plus tillage and waterlogging (MTW) on soil microbial activities and SMR were relatively low owing to restriction by waterlogging. Overall, MTW was a relatively low carbon method for control of the spread of S. alterniflora. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most ecosystems. Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (Spartina spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of' invasion by a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora X S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system shifted from all algae-bascd to a detritus-based food web. We then tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing that species that consume Spartina detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing N-15-labeled Spartina detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following Spartina invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up N-15 from labeled native and invasive Spartina detritus. In contrast, We found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based oil C-13 enrichment experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of' detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect N-15 uptake from cletritus. Our investigations support a "trophic shift" model for ecosystem response to wetland plant invasion and preview loss of key trophic support for fishes and migratory birds by shifting dominance to species not widely consumed by species at higher trophic levels.

AB  - The carbon isotope fractionation between CO2 and CH4 was studied during open system (related to gas flow) culture experiments with CO2-reducing methanogenic Archaea. To study the temperature dependence of isotope fractionation during biological methanogenesis, three representatives of the order Methanococcales were cultivated in the temperature range 35-85 degrees C. In the stationary growth phase, the carbon isotope fractionation factor between CO2 and CH4 was found to range between 1.048 and 1.079, depending on the growth temperature and on the type of fermenter. In contrast to published data derived from culture experiments, our results fall in the range of naturally occurring carbon isotope fractionations of coexisting CO2-CH4 pairs in marine sediments. Moreover, the fractionation closely approached the thermodynamic equilibrium between both gases, although thermal isotope exchange processes are unlikely to occur below 200 degrees C. Our findings suggest that flow-through culture experiments are useful when studying biological methanogenesis and associated (carbon-) isotope fractionation as a means of deciphering complex methanogenic processes in sediments.

AB  - Hypothetical models in the scientific literature suggest that ecosystem restoration and creation sites follow a smooth path of development (called a trajectory), rapidly matching natural reference sites (the target). Multi-million-dollar mitigation agreements have been based on the expectation that damages to habitat will be compensated within 5-10 years, and monitoring periods have been set accordingly. Our San Diego Bay study site, the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge, has one of the longest and most detailed records of habitat development at a mitigation site: data on soil organic matter, soil nitrogen, plant growth, and plant canopies for up to 10 years from a 12-year-old site. High interannual variation and lack of directional changes indicate little chance that targets will be reached in the near future. Other papers perpetuate the trajectory model, despite data that corroborate our findings. After reviewing "trajectory models" and presenting our comprehensive data for the first time, we suggest alternative management and mitigation policies.

AB  - Large areas of natural coastal wetlands have suffered severely from human-driven damages or conversions (e.g., land reclamations), but coastal carbon flux responses in reclaimed wetlands are largely unknown. The lack of knowledge of the environmental control mechanisms of carbon fluxes also limits the carbon budget management of reclaimed wetlands. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a coastal wetland at Dongtan of Chongming Island in the Yangtze estuary was monitored throughout 2012 using the eddy covariance technique more than 14 years after this wetland was reclaimed using dykes to stop tidal flooding. The driving biophysical variables of NEE were also examined. The results showed that NEE displayed marked diurnal and seasonal variations. The monthly mean NEE showed that this ecosystem functioned as a CO2 sink during 9 months of the year, with a maximum value in September (-101.2 g C m(-2)) and a minimum value in November (-8.2 g C m(-2)). The annual CO2 balance of the reclaimed coastal wetland was -558.4 g C m(-2) year(-1). The ratio of ecosystem respiration (ER) to gross primary production (GPP) was 0.57, which suggests that 57 % of the organic carbon assimilated by wetland plants was consumed by plant respiration and soil heterotrophic respiration. Stepwise multiple linear regressions suggested that temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were the two dominant micrometeorological variables driving seasonal variations in NEE, while soil moisture (M (s)) and soil salinity (PSs) played minor roles. For the entire year, PAR and daytime NEE were significantly correlated, as well as temperature and nighttime NEE. These nonlinear relationships varied seasonally: the maximum ecosystem photosynthetic rate (A (max)), apparent quantum yield (a,), and Q (10) reached their peak values during summer (17.09 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), autumn (0.13 mu mol CO2 mu mol(-1) photon), and spring (2.16), respectively. Exceptionally high M (s) or PSs values indirectly restricted ecosystem CO2 fixation capacity by reducing the PAR sensitivity of the NEE. The leaf area index (LAI) and live aboveground biomass (AGB(L)) were significantly correlated with NEE during the growing season. Although the annual net CO2 fixation rate of the coastal reclaimed wetland was distinctly lower than the unreclaimed coastal wetland in the same region, it was quite high relative to many inland freshwater wetlands and estuarine/coastal wetlands located at latitudes higher than this site. Thus, it is concluded that although the net CO2 fixation capacity of the coastal wetland was reduced by land reclamation, it can still perform as an important CO2 sink.

AB  - We explore the role of plant matter accumulation in the sediment column in determining the response of fluvial-deltas to base-level rise and simple subsidence profiles. Making the assumption that delta building processes operate to preserve the geometry of the delta plain, we model organic sedimentation in terms of the plant matter accumulation and accommodation (space made for sediment deposition) rates. A spatial integration of the organic sedimentation, added to the known river sediment input, leads to a model of delta evolution that estimates the fraction of organic sediments preserved in the delta. The model predicts that the maximum organic fraction occurs when the organic matter accumulation rate matches the accommodation rate, a result consistent with field observations. The model also recovers the upper limit for coal accumulation previously reported in the coal literature. Further, when the model is extended to account for differences in plant matter accumulation between fresh and saline environments (i.e., methanogenesis versus sulfate reduction) we show that an abrupt shift in the location of the fresh-salt boundary can amplify the speed of shoreline retreat.

AB  - Stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used to analyse the food web downstream of the largest estuary on the French coast: the Gironde. The different sources of organic matter supporting the most abundant and commercially important fish species were determined, as well as habitat connectivity for fish. Stable isotope analysis was performed in different producers (marine, freshwater and local sources), primary consumers (zooplankton and macrozoobenthos) and nine fish species (Alosa alosa, Engraulis encrasicolus, Sprattus sprattus, Liza ramada, Pomatoschistus minutus, Platichthys flesus, Solea solea, Dicentrarchus punctatus and Argyrosomus regius) in three habitats of the downstream area of the estuary in June-July 2012. All sources and invertebrates had significantly different isotopic signatures in different habitats. Only sole, S. solea, presented distinct dual isotopic signatures, indicating a higher feeding location fidelity, no other fish species showed significant differences in isotopic signatures. This overlap was interpreted as evidence that fish had not been feeding exclusively in the habitat where they were collected, instead ingesting food with different isotopic signatures, reflecting high habitat connectivity for these fish. As the base of the fish food web significantly differed among habitats, the present study indicated the suitability of stable isotopes in tracing fish movements and their fidelity/connectivity for habitats separated by less than 10 km, particularly estuarine habitats without salinity differences but located on opposite banks. The SIAR mixing model estimations of organic matter contribution to fish diets in the Gironde estuary were quite similar for the fish species investigated. The major organic source was marine-derived POM, with contributions > 75 % for each species. Freshwater and local POM (generally indicated as the sources structuring estuarine food webs) contributed little to the overall fish food webs in the Gironde estuary. Only flounder, P. flesus, and shad, A. alosa, migratory amphihaline species, utilised freshwater POM in greater proportion than marine. The observed low freshwater POM-high marine POM contribution to the fish food web seems to be explained by the reduced intertidal surface of the system. This characterization of the trophic base and habitat connectivity for the most important Gironde estuary fish provides a novel insight for future management of the estuary, especially in the current context of global change.

AB  - Insufficient sedimentation. coupled with high rates of relative sea-level rise (subsidence plus eustatic sea-level rise). are two important factors contributing to wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. USA. We hypothesized that adding nutrient-rich, secondarily treated wastewater effluent to subsiding wetlands in Louisiana could promote vertical accretion in these systems through increased organic matter production and subsequent deposition and allow accretion to keep pace with estimated rates of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). However. we also hypothesized that nutrient enrichment could stimulate the decomposition of organic matter, thus negating any increase in accretion due to increased organic matter accumulation. To test these hypotheses, We measured leaf-litter decomposition, litter nutrient dynamics. and sediment accretion in a permanently flooded and subsiding forested wetland receiving wastewater effluent and in an adjacent control site, both before and after effluent applications began. We also measured organic and mineral matter accumulation in the treatment site before and after effluent applications began. A Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) statistical analysis revealed that neither leaf-litter decomposition rates nor initial leaf-litter N and P concentration were affected by wastewater effluent. A similar analysis revealed that final N and P leaf-litter concentrations did significantly increase in the treatment site relative to the control after effluent was applied. Total pre-effluent accretion, measured 34 months after feldspar horizon markers were laid down, averaged ( SE) 22.3 +/- 3.2 mm and 14.9 +/- 4.6 mm in the treatment and control sites. respectively, and were not significantly different. However, total accretion measured 68 months after the markers were installed and 29 months after effluent additions began in the treatment site averaged 54.6 +/- 1.5 mm in the treatment site and 19.0 +/- 3.2 mm in the control site and were significantly different. Additionally, after wastewater applications began, the estimated rate of accretion in the treatment site (11.4 mm yr(-1)) approached the estimated rate of RSLR ( 123 mm yr-1). Most of this increase in accretion was attributed to organic matter inputs, as organic matter accumulation increased significantly in the treatment site after effluent application began, while mineral accumulation rates remained constant. These findings indicate that there is a potential for using wastewater to balance accretion deficits in subsiding wetland systems.

AB  - For the first time, the methane emissions from diverse coastal wetlands of South India have been measured. Annual emission rates varied widely, ranging from 3.10 mg/m(2)/hr (Bay of Bengal) to 21.56 mg/m(2)/hr (Adyar River), based on nature of the perturbance to each of the ecosystems studied. Distinct seasonality in methane emission was noticed in an unpolluted ecosystem (mangrove: 7.38 mg/m(2)/hr) and over a twofold increase was evident in the ecosystem that was disturbed by human activities (21.56 mg/m(2)/hr). The wide ranges in estimate suggest that methanogenesis occurs by both natural and anthropogenic activities in these coastal wetlands. Several physical and chemical factors such as salinity, sulfate, oxygen, and organic matter content influenced methanogenesis to a large degree in each of these ecosystems in addition to individual responses to human-induced stress. For example, there was a clear negative correlation between oxygen availability (0.99), sulfate (0.98), and salinity (0.98) with CH(4) emission in the Adyar river ecosystem. Although similar results were obtained for the other wetland ecosystems, CH(4) emission was largely influenced by tidal fluctuations, resulting in a concomitant increase in methanogenesis with high sulfate concentrations. This study demonstrates that coastal wetlands are potentially significant sources of atmospheric methane and could be a greater source if anthropogenic perturbations continue at the current rate.

AB  - We applied a spectroscopic analysis to Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected from low and medium altitudes during and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to delineate the distribution of oil-damaged canopies in the marshes of Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Spectral feature analysis compared the AVIRIS data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 23 mu m, which arise from C-H bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3%, 89.8%, and 90.6% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5 m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2 m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the AVIRIS data to 30 m reduced the accuracy to 73.6% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4 m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5 m AVIRIS data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat ETM data to 30 m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, similar to 40 km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11 m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21 m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey. July 10, to the latest airborne survey. October 4, 2010. The results demonstrate the applicability of high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data to identifying contaminants in the environment for use in evaluating ecosystem disturbance and response.

AB  - The macrobenthos is important in benthic remineralization processes; it represents a trophic link and is also often used as a bio-indicator in monitoring programs. Variations of the environmental parameters strongly influence the structure of the macrobenthic communities in the marshes and since macrobenthos is the most important food item for marsh-visiting fish species in the Schelde, the variation in food resources can have a strong effect on the higher trophic level. The present study deals with the variation in macrobenthic communities in different habitats of intertidal marshes along the salinity gradient and the differences between the marsh creeks and the intertidal part of the estuary. The study measured density and species richness together with the biomass, and sampled a large intertidal channel and a smaller creek within five marshes along the salinity gradient of the Schelde estuary every six weeks between May and October in 2000.
   The small creeks had a smaller grain size and higher organic matter content than those in the large channel although the differences in the environmental parameters did not explain the different communities in the two habitats. Marshes had distinct macrobenthic communities but the abundance of macrofauna fluctuated along the estuary without an identifiable spatial trend. In contrast, the total biomass increased towards the euhaline area due to the domination of Nereis diversicolor. Diversity showed a significant positive correlation with the salinity.
   Comparison of the macrofaunal communities in the marsh with those on the intertidal flats of the estuary indicated similar trends in density, biomass and diversity along the salinity gradient. The density was similar in both habitats whereas biomass was much higher in the intertidal habitats of the estuary, partly due to the higher biomass of molluscs and annelids. Diversity indices were higher in the marsh, and the freshwater area had more species than in the estuary. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is assumed that to treat excess NO3- high soil organic matter content (%OM) is required to maintain high denitrification rates in natural or restored wetlands. However, this excess also represents a risk by increasing soil decomposition rates triggering peat collapse and wetland fragmentation. Here, we evaluated the role of %OM and temperature interactions controlling denitrification rates in eroding (Barataria Bay-BLC) and emerging (Wax Lake Delta-WLD) deltaic regions in coastal Louisiana using the isotope pairing (IPT) and N-2:Ar techniques. We also assessed differences between total (direct denitrification + coupled nitrification-denitrification) and net (total denitrification minus nitrogen fixation) denitrification rates in benthic and wetland habitats with contrasting %OM and bulk density (BD). Sediment (benthic) and soil (wetland) cores were collected during summer, spring, and winter (2015-2016) and incubated at close to in-situ temperatures (30 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 10 degrees C, respectively). Denitrification rates were linearly correlated with temperature; maximum mean rates ranged from 40.1-124.1 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) in the summer with lower rates (<26.2 +/- 5.3 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) in the winter seasons. Direct denitrification was higher than coupled denitrification in all seasons. Denitrification rates were higher in WLD despite lower %OM, lower total N concentration, and higher BD in wetland soils. Therefore, in environments with low carbon availability, high denitrification rates can be sustained as long as NO3- concentrations are high (>30 mu M) and water temperature is >10 degrees C. In coastal Louisiana, substrates under these regimes are represented by emergent supra-tidal flats or land created by sediment diversions under oligohaline conditions (<1 ppt).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how vertical accretion rates in marshes vary through the millennia. Peat cores were collected in remnant and drained marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Cubic smooth spline regression models were used to construct age-depth models and accretion histories for three remnant marshes. Estimated vertical accretion rates at these sites range from 0.03 to 0.49 cm year(-1). The mean contribution of organic matter to soil volume at the remnant marsh sites is generally stable (4.73% to 6.94%), whereas the mean contribution of inorganic matter to soil volume has greater temporal variability (1.40% to 7.92%). The hydrogeomorphic position of each marsh largely determines the inorganic content of peat. Currently, the remnant marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise, but this balance may shift for at least one of the sites under future sea level rise scenarios.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB  - This paper describes a wetland elevation/sediment accretion model for a subsiding forested wetland located within the coastal zone of Louisiana, USA. We designed the model to determine if the addition of secondarily treated municipal wastewater to the wetland could stimulate organic matter production and deposition to the point that sediment accretion would balance relative sea level rise (deep subsidence plus eustatic sea level rise (ESLR)). We also used the model to simulate the effect of predicted increases in ESLR on wetland stability and to determine the amount of additional mineral sediment that would be required to compensate for relative sea level rise. The model utilizes a cohort approach to simulate sediment dynamics (organic and mineral matter accretion, decomposition, compaction, and below-ground productivity) and yields total sediment height as an output. Sediment height is balanced with ESLR and deep subsidence, both forcing functions, to calculate wetland elevation relative to mean water levels. The model also simulates primary production (roots, leaves, wood, and floating aquatic vegetation) and mineral matter deposition, both of which are feedback functions of elevation. Simulated wetland elevation was more sensitive to the uncertainty surrounding estimates of deep subsidence and future ESLR rates than in other processes that affect wetland elevation and could be influenced by wastewater (i.e. rates of decomposition and primary productivity). The model projected that, although the addition of wastewater effluent would increase long term accretion rates from 0.35 to 0.46 cm year(-1), it would not be enough to offset the current rate of relative sea level rise. A series of mineral input simulations revealed that, given no increase in ESLR rates, an additional 3000 g m(-2) year(-1) of mineral sediments would be required to maintain a stable elevation.

AB  - The macrozoobenthic assemblages of the Orbetello lagoon was studied in 1994. This basin, one of the widest western Mediterranean lagoons, showed, at the end of 1970s, very rich and highly structured communities, mainly due to the heterogeneity of its habitats and also presented large prairies of marine phanerogams. An increase in organic pollution over recent years has progressively brought about change in the environment, eventually leading in 1992 and 1993 to extended spring macrophyte blooms followed by severe dystrophic crises with high fish mortality in most of the lagoon, The aim of this study was to describe the zoobenthic community structure after these crises in order to assess the ecological conditions of the lagoon, A total of 70 species and 15332 individuals were collected at the 9 stations sampled quarterly (March, June, September, December). The results of ordination and correlation analysis indicated that the oxygen level and organic matter percentage in the sediment mainly influenced horizontal species distribution in the different sites at each sampling date. Furthermore, a clear impoverishment of the communities in comparison to previous researches was also observed. Species reduction affected not only marine ta,va but also the so-called opportunistic species (primarily annelids) which were confined near sea inlets, Such patterns, which were quite unusual and differed from those described in other brackish environments with high organic pollution, gave evidence of a reduced resilience of the community despite a moderate recovery in December. The Orbetello lagoon in 1994 was therefore to be considered as under severe environmental stress and it was difficult to assess when or whether these drastic changes will be reversible.

AB  - Recent studies of estuarine sediment deposits have focused on grain size spectra as a tool to better understand depositional processes, in particular those associated with tidal inlet and basin dynamics. The key to accurate interpretation of lithostratigraphic sequences is establishing clear connections between morphodynamic changes and the resulting shifts in sediment texture. Here, we report on coupled analysis of shallow sediment profiles from a closed estuarine lagoon in concert with recent changes in lagoon morphology reconstructed from historic sources, with a specific emphasis on the ability of suite statistics to provide meaningful insights into changes in sediment transport agency. We found that a major reorganization in lagoon morphology, dating to the 1940s, was associated with a shift in sediment deposition patterns. The restricted inlet was associated with deposition of sediments that were finer, less negatively skewed, and less leptokurtic in distribution than sediments deposited while the lagoon had a more open structure. These shifts are associated with a change in transport process from fluvial (through-flow) to closed basin (trapping). We also found other chemostratigraphic changes accompanying this shift in sediment texture, reflecting changes in organic matter source, wetland species composition, and an increase in sediment organic content, as presumably coarse, well-ventilated floodplain sediments tend to result in mineralization rather than sequestration of organic matter. In conclusion, we found that grain size analysis, in concert with the suite statistics technique, reflected changes in coastal configuration supported by historic maps and photos, however, we also recognize that this analysis was more informative given further context through additional sedimentary analyses. These findings provide a basis for the interpretation of particle size distribution in lithostratigraphic sequences associated with bar-built estuaries, where understanding natural and anthropogenically-modified inlet dynamics may help shape conservation management where concerns exist with respect to fish passage, water quality, and sediment transport.

AB  - The key role of oxidation processes in the humification of peat-forming plant components was experimentally confirmed. A number of characteristic properties of the transformation of organic matter under conditions of the North, in particular, a decrease in the depth of humification and the pronounced predominance of the fulvate type of humification was revealed. It was established that special climatic effects are a factor affecting the formation of the group chemical composition of peat. It was demonstrated that, under the conditions of northern territories with consideration for the frost zone of a peat deposit, the conditions of oxidation and the kinetics of humification processes in the organic matter of peat in top and bottom layers can be essentially different; this fact explained the nonmonotonic changes in the characteristics of peat with the depth of occurrence. The effect of the bituminous component on the humification process of organic matter in the course of peat deposition was found; this was primarily due to the inhibition of the formation of polyconjugated structures, which are the main structure factor of humic substances.

AB  - We investigated the contribution of high molecular weight and colloidal material to total alkalinity, dissolved organic and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in samples from a temperate nearshore environment (Tomales Bay, California), a tropical nearshore environment, (Australia Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Queensland, Australia) and a coral reef environment (Davies Reef, Australia).  Amicon UM-10 ultrafilters (10 000 daltons or 3 nm nominal cutoff) were used to remove high molecular weight material, including colloids, from conventionally filtered samples (Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, Tomales Bay; or 0.45-mu-m pore size mixed cellulose ester Millipore filters, Australia).
   We found no evidence of a high molecular weight component of total seawater alkalinity.  Ultrafiltration removed 3% of reactive phosphorus, 71% of organic phosphorus, 28% of organic carbon, 1% of ammonium and 27% of organic nitrogen from GF/C filtrates of Tomales Bay samples.  Reactive silicate and nitrate plus nitrite concentrations were unaffected by ultrafiltration.
   Microscopic examination of Tomales Bay samples revealed that 75-100% of the bacterioplankton present in the unaltered sample passed through the GF/C filter.  Calculations based on published values of the carbon content and carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus ratio of bacterioplankton cells indicated that their contribution to organic carbon retained by the ultrafilter was negligible.  However, bacterioplankton accounted for 12% of the organic nitrogen and 27% of the organic phosphorus in GF/C filtrates and 29% and 39% of the organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus, respectively, removed by ultrafiltration.  Organic phosphorus removed by filtration through GF/F glass fiber filters, through 0.22-mu-m pore size Millipore (mixed cellulose ester) filters, or through 1.0 or 0.2-mu-m pore size Nucleopore (polycarbonate) filters was equivalent to the calculated phosphorus content of the bacteria removed by the same filters.
   These results suggest that bacterial cells are an important component of traditionally defined high molecular weight dissolved organic matter, and that the composition of this material should reflect the composition of bacterial cells.  Furthermore, bacterial cells are an important component of the net hydrographic export of organic phosphorus, and to a lesser extent organic nitrogen, from Tomales Bay.

AB  - We used the ecosystem process model Biome-BGC to simulate the effects of harvest and residue removal management scenarios on soil carbon (C), available soil nitrogen (N), net primary production (NPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP) in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) ecosystems in northern Wisconsin, USA. To assess harvest effects, we simulated short (50-year) and long (100-year) harvest intervals, high (clear-cut) and low (selective) harvest intensities, and three levels of residue retention (15%, 25%, and 35%) over a 500-year period. The model simulation of NPP, soil C accumulation, and NEP agreed reasonably well with biometric and eddy-covariance measurements of these two ecosystems. The more intensive (50-year rotation clear-cuts with low residue retention) harvest scenarios tended to have the greatest NEP (420 and 678 t C ha-1 for the 500-year interval for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively). All the harvest scenarios decreased mineral soil C and available mineral soil N content relative to the no-harvest scenario for jack pine and sugar maple. The rate of change in mineral soil C decreased the greatest in the most intensive biomass removal scenarios (-0.012 and -0.072 t C ha-1 yr-1 relative to no-harvest for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively) and the smallest decrease was observed in the least intensive biomass removal scenarios (-0.002 and -0.009 t C ha-1 yr-1 relative to no-harvest for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively). The more intensive biomass removal harvest scenarios in sugar maple significantly decreased peak productivity (NPP) in the simulation period.

AB  - Invasive plants can influence ecosystem processes such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetland systems directly through plant-mediated transfer of GHGs to the atmosphere or through indirect modification of the environment. However, patterns of plant invasion often co-vary with other environmental gradients, so attributing ecosystem effects to invasion can be difficult in observational studies. Here, we assessed the impact of Phragmites australis invasion into native shortgrass communities on methane (CH4) emissions by conducting field measurements of CH4 emissions along transects of invasion by Phragmites in two neighboring brackish marsh sites and compared these findings to those from a field-based mesocosm experiment. We found remarkable differences in CH4 emissions and the influence of Phragmites on CH4 emissions between the two neighboring marsh sites. While Phragmites consistently increased CH4 emissions dramatically by 10.4 +/- 3.7 mu mol m(-2) min(-1) (mean +/- SE) in our high-porewater CH4 site, increases in CH4 emissions were much smaller (1.4 +/- 0.5 mu mol m(-2) min(-1)) and rarely significant in our low-porewater CH4 site. While CH4 emissions in Phragmites-invaded zones of both marsh sites increased significantly, the presence of Phragmites did not alter emissions in a complementary mesocosm experiment. Seasonality and changes in temperature and light availability caused contrasting responses of CH4 emissions from Phragmites- versus native zones. Our data suggest that Phragmites-mediated CH4 emissions are particularly profound in soils with innately high rates of CH4 production. We demonstrate that the effects of invasive species on ecosystem processes such as GHG emissions may be predictable qualitatively but highly variable quantitatively. Therefore, generalizations cannot be made with respect to invader-ecosystem processes, as interactions between the invader and local abiotic conditions that vary both spatially and temporally on the order of meters and hours, respectively, can have a stronger impact on GHG emissions than the invader itself.

AB  - Although empirical studies show that invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) has reduced soil bulk density (BD), the mechanisms that underpin this response are still unclear. To explore this pattern, we used a space-for-time substitution approach and collected soil samples from the eastern coast of China, where S. alterniflora ecosystems were established a short period of time after initial invasion. We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on BD through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes. The model showed that these processes explain 82% of the BD variation in response to S. alterniflora invasion. We observed that SOC had the most direct influence on BD, followed by salinity and soil sand content. We also found that S. alterniflora invasion had an important direct influence on the measured variables. Although plant productivity was not directly related to BD, it was indirectly associated with the impacts of plant productivity on salinity. Our results highlight the occurrence of BD variability within an interacting system of soil and plants wherein S. alterniflora invasion leads to a decrease in BD. This work also highlights that identifying the mechanisms driving BD variability in response to S. alterniflora invasion would help to improve our understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.

AB  - Studies on food web structure in estuaries based on stable isotopes have usually not taken spatiotemporal variations in the isotopic variability of food web components into account. We investigated temporal and between-habitat variations in the isotopic composition (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of basal food sources-i.e. primary producers, particulate organic matter (POM) in the sediment or in suspension, and biofilm-and consumers and explored their implications for food web structure and dynamics. Samples of 9 basal sources (N = 224) and 6 representative invertebrates and fish (N = 303) were collected monthly over 1 yr in a marsh creek and a mudflat of the Patos Lagoon, a large southwestern Atlantic estuary. The relative contributions of food sources to consumers were estimated by mixing models. Overall, delta C-13 values of food sources and consumers were higher (p < 0.05) in the mudflat, whereas delta N-15 values were enriched (p < 0.05) in the marsh creek for most primary producers and consumers. C and N isotope values varied on both monthly and seasonal scales, with several food sources and consumers exhibiting higher values (p < 0.05) during the spring and summer. The primary food sources were POM in the sediment, C-4 plants (e. g. widgeon grass), and, to a lesser extent, suspended POM. Biofilm and macroalgae were also food sources for consumers in the marsh creek and mudflat, respectively, especially during warmer seasons. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that the Patos lagoon food web is spatially structured and supported by local basal sources and detritus of different origins, which can be seasonally important for consumers in each particular habitat.

AB  - In the southern and central Black Sea, reduced sulfur comprises nearly 1% of the total particulate flux in the anoxic water column, as measured by time-series sediment traps. Sulfur isotopic composition of particulate sulfide fluxes indicates an origin near the oxic-anoxic interface, where dissolved sulfide is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulfide below 175 m due to chemical oxidation. A strong seasonal correlation exists between sulfur and organic carbon fluxes; this, together with particulate sulfide precipitation at the oxic-anoxic interface, suggests that sulfides are scavenged from the interface during maximum production of settling organic aggregates, particularly during the late summer coccolithophorid blooms. Sulfide precipitation deeper in the water column and in sediments may be limited by availability of iron and/or polysulfides, since there are no particulate sulfide fluxes which have the same isotopic composition as ambient dissolved sulfide at trap depths. Since sulfides in surface sediments are often isotopically similar to dissolved sulfide at the top of the sulfide zone and to sediment trap fluxes, sedimentary sulfides could originate from metal sulfide fluxes forming at the oxic-anoxic interface and would reflect sulfur-cycling processes at the oxic-anoxic interface. Sedimentary sulfate reduction rates estimated from assuming 65-80% utilization of particulate organic carbon fluxes agree reasonably well with other estimates of sulfate reduction and sulfide production rates. A sulfur isotope-based box-model for sulfur cycling between dissolved and particulate phases in the water column and sediments is presented.

AB  - Search for bioindicators in marine environments has provided new tools for monitoring global and local natural changes. Among these tools, benthic foraminifera play a central role. More accurate paleogeographical and paleoecological reconstructions become possible on the basis of the ecology of recent foraminifera. Nevertheless, factors acting on foraminiferal assemblages are still partially understood. The aim of this study is to correlate the distribution patterns of living (stained) benthic foraminifera with environmental variables such as tidal elevation, interstitial pore water salinity. organic matter content of the sediment, pheopigments. chlorophyll a, carbonate contents and grain size distribution of the sediment from 86 samples collected in the Aiguillon cove (France). In this paralic environment, sediment grain size. salinity and tidal elevation are fundamental factors that drive the distribution of the most abundant species i.e. Brizalina variabilis, Cribroelphidium excavatum and Haynesina germanica. Organic matter also influences the distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera: the relative abundance of Ammonia tepida is typically favored by all increase of total organic matter food resources. Chlorophyll a and pheopigments, as indicators of organic matter quality however may not be limiting in the proportion present in the Aiguillon cove. Carbonate proportions do not limit benthic foraminifera of the Aiguillon cove essentially with carbonaceous shells.

AB  - Black mangroves (Avicennia spp.) are hypothesized to expand their latitudinal range with global climate change in the 21st century, induced by a reduction in the frequency and severity of coastal freezes, which are known to limit mangrove colony extent and individual tree size. The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise (ESLR) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, TX. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1 -2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. Pb-210 and Cs-137 accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed pH over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.

AB  - Blue Carbon (BC) strategy refers to the approaches that mitigate and adapt to climate change through the conservation and restoration of seagrass, saltmarsh and mangrove ecosystems and, in some BC programs, also through the expansion of seaweed aquaculture. The major losses of coastal habitats in combination with the commitments of China under the Paris Agreement provide unique opportunity and necessity to develop a strong Chinese BC program. Here, we (1) characterize China's BC habitats, examine their changes since 1950 along with the drivers of changes; (2) consider the expansion of seaweed aquaculture and how this may be managed to become an emerging BC resource in China, along with the engineering solutions required to enhance its potential; and (3) provide the rationale and elements for BC program in China. We find China currently has 1326-2149 km(2) wild and 2-15 km(2) created mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats, while 9236-10059 km(2) (77-87%) has been lost since 1950, mainly due to land reclamation. The current area of farmed seaweed habitat is 1252-1265 km(2), which is close to the area of wild mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats. We conclude that BC strategies have potentials yet to be fully developed in China, particularly through climate change adaptation benefits such as coastal protection and eco-environmental co-benefits of seaweed farming such as habitat creation for fish and other biota, alleviation of eutrophication, hypoxia and acidification, and the generation of direct and value added products with lower environmental impact relative to land-based production. On this basis, we provide a roadmap for BC strategies adjusted to the unique characteristics and capacities of China.

AB  - Trophic processes in coastal lagoons are strongly influenced by freshwater inputs and water exchanges with the sea. In recent years, stable isotope analysis has become a widespread and reliable method for the examination of trophic structure over time and space, also in complex ecosystems such as coastal lagoons. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were studied in primary producers and consumers to identify organic matter source pools from terrestrial, benthic and pelagic environments and to characterise the trophic structure in three Mediterranean coastal lagoons (Lake Fusaro, the Lake of Sabaudia and Stagnone di Marsala). The results highlighted the negligible importance of terrestrial production to higher trophic levels in all the ecosystems investigated. Consumer dependence on benthic and pelagic organic matter showed high variability: overall macroalgae were at the base of the food web in Lake Fusaro and the Lake of Sabaudia, while mixed sources (seagrass detritus, epiphytes, macroalgae and sedimentary organic matter) appeared to be the major baseline food resource in the Stagnone di Marsala. We have found evidence for significant changes in the trophic structure in these Mediterranean coastal lagoons and such differences may be triggered by differential environmental features (e.g. freshwater inputs and hydrodynamic regime).

AB  - Seasonal variations of bacterial abundance on dead leaves decaying both in air and water, as well as microbial Electron Transport System (ETS) activity, were investigated in a Northeastern Moroccan temporary river, Oued Cherraa. Bacteria were counted using epifluorescence microscopy after sonication, and DAPI and acridine orange staining. ETS activity was measured with a spectrophotometer by the reduction of INT to INT-formazan. The results point out the overwhelming influence of water on bacterial distribution: bacteria were most abundant and larger during the flowing phase of the river and in a permanent pool. ETS activity on leaves was higher in water than in air, and during submersion it was higher in the permanent than in the temporary sites. Some temporal correlations were found with temperature and dissolved organic matter. Bacterial density peaked in May, and ETS activity in June. These trends explain a great part of the breakdown rates described from the same leaf packs in a former paper.

AB  - Due to the severe degradation and environmental pollution of coastal wetlands by human activities, they have gradually become an important source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, so exploring the characteristics of their emission is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coastal wetlands. In this study, the dynamics of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were investigated in five kinds of typical tidal flats from the Yellow River delta wetland during the years 2011-2013, and the influences of water level and salinity on their emissions were explored in laboratory experiments. The mean fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were -20.98 to 68.12 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 0.12 to 0.44 mg m(-2) h(-1) across all seasons in the five kinds of representative tidal flats. The highest and lowest mean fluxes of CO2 were mainly observed during summer and winter, respectively, whereas the seasons with the highest and lowest mean fluxes of CH4 varied according to the type of tidal flat. The results showed that the summer season and the mud flat environment had the largest contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. In laboratory experiments, the largest sequestration fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were observed with +4/+2 cm and -4 cm water levels, respectively, indicating that a moderately high water level was beneficial for CO2 sequestration but led to the increase of CH4 emission. In the study of salinity, we found that the largest sequestration fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were both detected at 24 g L-1 salinity, indicating that high salinity level was advantageous for CO2 and CH4 sequestration in the five simulation devices. Furthermore, a carbon cycle pathway of coastal wetlands was proposed, which could have a vital significance for research into the global carbon cycle. We can reduce GHG emissions by protecting the coastal wetlands and lessening human activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to test an innovative biomitigation approach, where polychaete-assisted (Hediste diversicolor) sand filters were combined with the production of Halimione portulacoides in aquaponics, to remediate an organic-rich effluent generated by a super intensive fish farm operating a land-based RAS (Recirculating aquaculture system). The set up included four different experimental combinations that were periodically monitored for 5 months. After this period, polychaete-assisted sand filters reduced in 70% the percentage of OM and the average densities increased from approximate to 400 ind.m(-2) to 7000 ind.m(-2). H. portulacoides in aquaponics contributed to an average DIN (Dissolved inorganic Nitrogen) decrease of 65%, which increased to 67% when preceded by filter tanks stocked with polychaetes. From May until October (5 months) halophytes biomass increased from 1.4 kg m(-2) +/- 0.7 (initial wet weight) to 18.6 kg m(-2) +/- 4.0. Bearing in mind that the uptake of carbon is mostly via photosynthesis and not though the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon, this represents an approximate incorporation of approximate to 1.3 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 15 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 8 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the aerial part (76% of total biomass), and an approximate incorporation of approximate to 0.5 kg m(-2) carbon (C), approximate to 3 g m(-2) nitrogen (N) and approximate to 2 g m(-2) phosphorus (P) in the roots (24% of total biomass). In the present study, the potential of the two extractive species for biomitigation of a super-intensive marine fish farm effluent could be clearly demonstrated, contributing in this way to potentiate the implementation of more sustainable practices.

AB  - We report that iron-reducing bacteria are primary mediators of anaerobic carbon oxidation in upland tropical soils spanning a rainfall gradient (3500-5000 mm/yr) in northeast Puerto Rico. The abundant rainfall and high net primary productivity of these tropical forests provide optimal soil habitat for iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria. Spatially and temporally dynamic redox conditions make iron-transforming microbial communities central to the belowground carbon cycle in these wet tropical forests. The exceedingly high abundance of iron-reducing bacteria (up to 1.2 x 10(9) cells per gram soil) indicated that they possess extensive metabolic capacity to catalyze the reduction of iron minerals. In soils from the higher rainfall sites, measured rates of ferric iron reduction could account for up to 44% of organic carbon oxidation. Iron reducers appeared to compete with methanogens when labile carbon availability was limited. We found large numbers of bacteria that oxidize reduced iron at sites with high rates of iron reduction and large numbers of iron reducers. The coexistence of large populations of iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria is evidence for rapid iron cycling between its reduced and oxidized states and suggests that mutualistic interactions among these bacteria ultimately fuel organic carbon oxidation and inhibit CH(4) production in these upland tropical forests.

AB  - Environmental parameters controlling fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHG) differ spatially within landscapes. This study aimed to improve the understanding of landscape processes controlling GHG-fluxes of different landscape units of marshes (in terms of vegetation, land use and seawater inflow) at the Southern North Sea coast. For this emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were quantified and related to reported carbon sequestration rates. Ancillary environmental parameters were determined to identify controlling factors and thresholds enabling GHG emissions. For inland marshes (enclosed by embankments) the water level was the predominant factor controlling CH4 emissions ranging between 1.58 and 1544.70 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1). The duration of threshold (10 cm below surface) exceedance was found as a predictor for annual CH4 emissions. Emissions of outland marshes (influenced by tides) varying from -1.34 to 55.14 kg CH4 ha(-1) a(-1) were predominantly controlled by sulphate (SO42-) concentrations, because soil CH4-contents were negligible when soil SO42--contents exceeded 0.5 mg g(-1). The variability of the N2O-fluxes (-0.81 to 17.78 kgN(2)O ha(-1) a(-1)) could not be explained by the collected environmental parameters. GHG balances indicated that inland extensive grasslands and particularly reed stands are net sources of CO2-equivalents (100 year time horizon), while outlands are natural sinks.

AB  - Clarifying the effects of hydrological environmental gradient on soil physicochemical and microbial properties in riparian zone can be helpful for understanding the characteristics of soil ecosystem in the riparian zone, so as to provide a scientific suggestion for the ecological protection and restoration of the riparian zone. Therefore, we measured four types of indices (soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, microbial number and bacterial diversity) for 120 soil samples which had been taken from 4 hydrologic environmental gradients in 10 typical study sites in Lijiang watershed, and analyzed the correlation between the indices and their change trend along the hydrological environment. The results showed that there were a strong coupling and mutual exclusion among different types of characteristic indices of soil in the Lijiang riparian zones; Soil bacterial diversity (phylogenetic diversity, operational taxonomic units, Chao1) was positively correlated with soil pH and negatively correlated with soil organic matter and catalase; Bacteria and actinomycetes number had a positive correlation with available nitrogen, acid phosphatase and sucrase. There were also significant differences in soil physicochemical properties and microbial community structure under different hydrological environments, featuring with the characteristic of gradual change. With decrease of inundation frequency, the bacterial diversity (operational taxonomic units, phylogenetic diversity) decreased gradually, and the soil organic matter, available nitrogen, fungi number and the catalase activity increased gradually; the soil pH value, number of bacteria and actinomycetes, invertase and acid phosphatase activities increased first and then decreased. The research emphasized to maintain the integrity of the hydrological environment gradient and adapt to the gradually changing structure of riparian soil ecosystem, which are the factors to be considered fully during the ecological restoration of the Lijiang riparian zone.

AB  - The analysis of Cadmium in soils and vegetation samples collected in several sampling sites in north and south banks of the River Sado estuary was carried out over the course of a year. The results confirm that Cd is easily taken up by H. portulacoides roots and translocated to the leaves. In 75% of the cases the Cd content of leaves was higher than the root content, enhancing the great mobility, of this element. A well defined Cd accumulation pattern was observed, the maximum values being obtained in July and October for roots and leaves, respectively. The accumulation of Cd in soil-marshes varies according to the nature of the matrix. The levels in sandy soils are lower than those observed in silty-loam soils; however, neither the organic matter nor the finest fraction of the soil (< 63-mu-m) constituted important binding sites, since r values were not significant at the 0.05 significant level. The highest Cd levels in soils were generally found in two distinct sampling sites, one located in the south bank, far from the major pollution sources, and the other in the north bank, next to several industrial plants and very close to a densely populated area, indicating that the sources of contamination are different.

AB  - Wetland vegetation developed in the crater of Mount Usu, northern Japan, soon after the 1977-1978 eruptions which destroyed the vegetation. The cover of each species was measured in 1994 in 118 50 cm x 50 cm plots situated in transects and related to environmental factors (elevation, water depth, soil texture, soil compaction, soil organic matter, and soil pH) to clarify vegetation development. Five vegetation types were recognized dominated by Eleocharis kamtschatica, Equisetum arvense, Lythrum salicaria, Juncus fauriensis and Phragmites australis respectively. Sedge/grass marsh and reed swamp dominated deep-water sites; willow swamp and wet meadow vegetation characterized shallow-water sites, indicating that vegetation zonation developed soon after the eruption. Since those wetland plants were derived neither from seed banks nor from vegetative propagules, they had to immigrate from outside the summit areas. However, except for willows, most species lack the ability for long-distance dispersal. Late successional species, such as P. australis established in the early stages of the primary succession. The water depth varied by 27.5 cm among the plots. Coarse soil particles accumulated, and pH (5.22-6.55) was low on the elevated sites. Organic matter ranged from 2.8 % to 19.1 %, and was high on the elevated sites. Water depth was responsible for the establishment of large-scale vegetation patterns, while edaphic factors, i.e. soil compaction, pH, and organic matter, were determinants of small-scale vegetation patterns. Among the edaphic factors, soil compaction appeared to have a strong influence on vegetation development.

AB  - Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) are important anaerobic terminal oxidisers of organic matter. However, we have little knowledge about the distribution and types of SRB and MA in the environment or the functional role they play in situ. Here we have utilised sediment slurry microcosms amended with ecologically significant substrates, including acetate and hydrogen, and specific functional inhibitors, to identify the important SRB and MA groups in two contrasting sites on a UK estuary. Substrate and inhibitor additions had significant effects on methane production and on acetate and sulphate consumption in the slurries. By using specific 16S-targeted oligonucleotide probes we were able to link specific SRB and MA groups to the use of the added substrates. Acetate consumption in the freshwater-dominated sediments was mediated by Methanosarcinales under low-sulphate conditions and Desulfobacter under the high-sulphate conditions that simulated a tidal incursion. In the marine-dominated sediments, acetate consumption was linked to Desulfobacter. Addition of trimethylamine, a non-competitive substrate for methanogenesis, led to a large increase in Methanosarcinales signal in marine slurries. Desulfobulbus was linked to non-sulphate-dependent H-2 consumption in the freshwater sediments. The addition of sulphate to freshwater sediments inhibited methane production and reduced signal from probes targeted to Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales, while the addition of molybdate to marine sediments inhibited Desulfobulbus and Desulfobacterium. These data complement our understanding of the ecophysiology of the organisms detected and make a firm connection between the capabilities of species, as observed in the laboratory, to their roles in the environment.

AB  - In flood-tolerant species, a common response to inundation is growth of adventitious roots into the water column. The capacity for these roots to become photosynthetically active has received scant attention. The experiments presented here show the aquatic adventitious roots of the flood-tolerant, halophytic stem-succulent, Tecticornia pergranulata (subfamily Salicornioideae, Chenopodiaceae) are photosynthetic and quantify for the first time the photosynthetic capacity of aquatic roots for a terrestrial species. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the presence of chloroplasts within cells of aquatic roots. Net O-2 production by excised aquatic roots, when underwater, was measured with varying light and CO2 regimes; the apparent maximum capacity (P-max) for underwater net photosynthesis in aquatic roots was 0.45 mu mol O-2 m(-2) s(-1). The photosynthetic potential of these roots was supported by the immunolocalization of PsbA, the major protein of photosystem II, and ribulose-1-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in root protein extracts. Chlorophyllous aquatic roots of T. pergranulata are photosynthetically active, and such activity is a previously unrecognized source of O-2, and potentially carbohydrates, in flooded and submerged plants.

Methods Litterbags containing a mixture of Spartina alterniflora litter and burned sediment were buried at four S. alterniflora saltmarshes and one S. alterniflora-Suaeda salsa co-existing saltmarsh. The contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and recalcitrant carbon (RC) were determined by a Sercon Integra CN isotope ratio mass spectrometer, while the content of labile carbon (LC) was estimated by calculation. C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was conducted to characterise the chemical structures of the organic carbon compounds in the S. alterniflora litter during decomposition. Solid-state C-13-CPMAS-NMR spectra were obtained using an AVANCE III 400 MHz (Bruker) spectrometer. Results The results indicated that more RC than LC remained in the litterbag during decomposition. The organic carbon content of the S. alterniflora litter was largely composed of alcoxyl-C compounds (78.9%), the decomposition products of which dominated the litter organic carbon fractions, including the TOC, RC, and LC. In contrast, alkyl-C, aromatic-C, and carboxyl-C products contributed mostly to RC. Differences in the negative correlations between the litter carbon fractions and alkyl-C, aromatic-C, and carboxyl-C were found among the developing saltmarshes. Humus generated by the S. alterniflora litter was mainly composed of macromolecular organic compounds containing functional groups such as methyl, methylene, methine, methoxyl, aromatic rings, phenolic hydroxyl, and carboxyl. Conclusions During decomposition, the organic carbon in the S. alterniflora litter was found to be dominated by O-alkyl-C, followed by aromatic-C, alkyl-C, and carboxyl-C. O-alkyl-C plays a major role in the LC proportion of organic carbon, while aromatic-C, alkyl-C, and carboxyl-C contribute more to the RC proportion. Alkyl-C was found to be more easily decomposed than aromatic-C in the S. alterniflora litter. During litter decomposition, the molecular structure complexity, humification degree, and decomposition degree of organic carbon exhibited seasonal variations. In the 3-year saltmarsh, more decomposition of the organic carbon in the S. alterniflora litter was observed as compared to other sites.

AB  - The interplay between sediment deposition patterns, organic matter type and the quantity and quality of reactive mineral phases determines the accumulation, speciation, and isotope composition of pore water and solid phase sulfur constituents in marine sediments. Here, we present the sulfur geochemistry of siliciclastic sediments from two sites along the Argentine continental slope-a system characterized by dynamic deposition and reworking, which result in non-steady state conditions. The two investigated sites have different depositional histories but have in common that reactive iron phases are abundant and that organic matter is refractory-conditions that result in low organoclastic sulfate reduction rates (SRR). Deposition of reworked, isotopically light pyrite and sulfurized organic matter appear to be important contributors to the sulfur inventory, with only minor addition of pyrite from organoclastic sulfate reduction above the sulfate-methane transition (SMT). Pore-water sulfide is limited to a narrow zone at the SMT. The core of that zone is dominated by pyrite accumulation. Iron monosulfide and elemental sulfur accumulate above and below this zone. Iron monosulfide precipitation is driven by the reaction of low amounts of hydrogen sulfide with ferrous iron and is in competition with the oxidation of sulfide by iron (oxyhydr) oxides to form elemental sulfur. The intervals marked by precipitation of intermediate sulfur phases at the margin of the zone with free sulfide are bordered by two distinct peaks in total organic sulfur (TOS). Organic matter sulfurization appears to precede pyrite formation in the iron-dominated margins of the sulfide zone, potentially linked to the presence of polysulfides formed by reaction between dissolved sulfide and elemental sulfur. Thus, SMTs can be hotspots for organic matter sulfurization in sulfide-limited, reactive iron-rich marine sedimentary systems. Furthermore, existence of elemental sulfur and iron monosulfide phases meters below the SMT demonstrates that in sulfide-limited systems metastable sulfur constituents are not readily converted to pyrite but can be buried to deeper sediment depths. Our data show that in non-steady state systems, redox zones do not occur in sequence but can reappear or proceed in inverse sequence throughout the sediment column, causing similar mineral alteration processes to occur at the same time at different sediment depths.

AB  - We hypothesize that nutrient cycling in a Gulf of Mexico subterranean estuary (STE) is fueled by oxygen and labile organic matter supplied by tidal pumping of seawater into the coastal aquifer. We estimate nutrient production rates using the standard estuarine model and a non-steady-state box model, separate nutrient fluxes associated with fresh and saline submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), and estimate offshore fluxes from radium isotope distributions. The results indicate a large variability in nutrient concentrations over tidal and seasonal time scales. At high tide, nutrient concentrations in shallow beach groundwater were low as a result of dilution caused by seawater recirculation. During ebb tide, the concentrations increased until they reached a maximum just before the next high tide. The dominant form of nitrogen was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in freshwater, nitrate in brackish waters, and ammonium in saline waters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production was two-fold higher in the summer than in the winter, while nitrate and DON production were one order of magnitude higher. Oxic remineralization and denitrification most likely explain these patterns. Even though fresh SGD accounted for only similar to 5% of total volumetric additions, it was an important pathway of nutrients as a result of biogeochemical inputs in the mixing zone. Fresh SGD transported similar to 25%, of DOC and similar to 50% of total dissolved nitrogen inputs into the coastal ocean, with the remainder associated with a one-dimensional vertical seawater exchange process. While SGD volumetric inputs are similar seasonally, changes in the biogeochemical conditions of this coastal plain STE led to higher summertime SGD nutrient fluxes (40%, higher for DOC and 60% higher for nitrogen in the summer compared to the winter). We suggest that coastal primary production and nutrient dynamics in the STE are linked. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants alter biomass allocation to optimize resource capture. Plant strategy for resource capture may have important implications in intertidal marshes, where soil nitrogen (N) levels and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are changing. We conducted a factorial manipulation of atmospheric CO2 (ambient and ambient + 340 ppm) and soil N (ambient and ambient + 25 g m(-2) year(-1)) in an intertidal marsh composed of common North Atlantic C-3 and C-4 species. Estimation of C-3 stem turnover was used to adjust aboveground C-3 productivity, and fine root productivity was partitioned into C-3-C-4 functional groups by isotopic analysis. The results suggest that the plants follow resource capture theory. The C-3 species increased aboveground productivity under the added N and elevated CO2 treatment (P < 0.0001), but did not under either added N or elevated CO2 alone. C-3 fine root production decreased with added N (P < 0.0001), but fine roots increased under elevated CO2 (P = 0.0481). The C-4 species increased growth under high N availability both above- and belowground, but that stimulation was diminished under elevated CO2. The results suggest that the marsh vegetation allocates biomass according to resource capture at the individual plant level rather than for optimal ecosystem viability in regards to biomass influence over the processes that maintain soil surface elevation in equilibrium with sea level.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provide important ecological services to the coastal zone, one of which is sediment retention. In this study we investigated sediment retention across a range of geomorphological settings and across vegetation zones comprising coastal wetlands. We selected six coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves over a gradient from riverine to tidal settings in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Each site was comprised of three distinct vegetation communities distributed as parallel zones to the coast line: seaward fringe mangroves, landward scrub mangroves and saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat of the high intertidal zone. We measured suspended sediment retention and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment transported and deposited in the mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon tracer, was used. Our results show a mean average sedimentation of 0.64 +/- 0.01 mg cm(-2) spring tide(-1), which was variable within sites, regardless of geomorphological setting. However, geomorphological setting influenced spatial patterns of sediment deposition. Riverine mangroves had a more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the fringe zone. Overall, the fringe zone retained the majority of sediment entering the coastal wetland during a tidal cycle with 0.90 +/- 0.22 mg cm(-2) spring tide(-1), accounting for 52.5 +/- 12.5% of the total sedimentation. The presence of glomalin in suspended sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting, with riverine mangroves receiving more glomalin in suspended solids than tidal mangroves. Glomalin was also differentially deposited within the vegetation zones at different geomorphological settings: primarily at the fringe zone of tidal mangroves and within the scrub zone of riverine mangroves. The differences we observed in the spatial distribution of sedimentation and the difference in the origin of the sediment deposited in riverine and tidal mangroves are likely to have an impact on ecological processes.

AB  - Suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes between Fourleague Bay, Louisiana and the northern Gulf of Mexico were sampled every 3 h for 3 months to examine the importance of atmospheric cold fronts and riverine forcing on the functioning of this estuarine system. A cold front index was developed and used to identify major winter frontal passages likely to have the largest effects on material concentrations and transport. Suspended sediment concentrations ranged from 11 to 1527 mg l(-1); the highest values occurred during winter frontal passages and the lowest during calm periods. High concentrations are generated by a continuous source of sediment from the Atchafalaya River and resuspension of benthic sediment via high intensity winds associated with cold fronts along with sufficient duration to keep the sediment in suspension. Spring peak discharge of the Atchafalaya River increased water levels and sediment concentrations in the bay leading to strong seasonal net exports of water (1.02 x 10(9) m(3)) and sediment (1.72 x 10(8) kg) into the Gulf of Mexico through Oyster Bayou over the 89-day study. Net fluxes associated with tidal forcing were nearly balanced with a small net export due to freshwater input. The combination of high volumes of water originating from the northern bay and the restricted outlet to the Gulf often cause increased water levels and inundation of the surrounding marshes and potential advection of sediments onto the marsh surface. The results suggest that marsh drainage often increases the particulate organic carbon export as a result of marsh flushing. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Chinese mangrove, an important ecosystem in coastal wetlands, is sensitive to the invasive alien species Spartina alterniflora. However, the effects of the S. alterniflora invasion on mangrove soil N2O emissions and the underlying mechanisms by which emissions are affected have not been well studied. In this study, the N2O emitted from soils dominated by two typical native mangroves (i.e. Kandelia obovata: KO; Avicennia marina: AM), one invaded by S. alterniflora (SA), and one bare mudflat (Mud) were monitored at Zhangjiang Mangrove Estuary (where S. alterniflora is exotic). Together with soil biogeochemical properties, the potential denitrification rate and the composition of soil bacterial communities were determined simultaneously by (NO3-)-N-15 tracer and high-throughput sequencing techniques, respectively. Our results showed that S. alterniflora invasion significantly (p < 0.05) increases soil N2O emissions by 15-28-fold. In addition, isotope results revealed that the soil potential denitrification rate was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced after S. alterniflora invasion. Moreover, the S. alterniflora invasion significantly (p < 0.05) decreased soil bacterial alpha-diversity and strongly modified soil bacterial communities. Indicator groups strongly associated with S. alterniflora were Chloroflexia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacilli, each of which was abundant and acts as connector in the co-occurrence network. FAPROTAX analysis implied that the S. alterniflora invasion stimulated soil denitrification and nitrification while depressing anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium(DNRA). Redundancy analysis (RDA) found that soil organicmatter (SOM) and pH were the most important environmental factors in altering soil bacterial communities. Taken together, our results imply that the S. alterniflora invasion in mangrove wetlands significantly stimulates soil denitrification and N2O emissions, thereby contributing N2O to the atmosphere and contributing to global climate change.

AB  - Surface sediments samples from the Cochin estuary were measured for elemental, stable isotopic and molecular biomarkers (aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids) to study the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter. Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and stable isotopic ratios of carbon (delta C-13) ranged from 0.62 to 2.74 %, 0.09 to 0.25 % and -27.5 to 21.7%, respectively. Sedimentary n-alkanes ranged from 6.03 to 43.23 mu g g(-1) with an average of 16.79 mu g g(-1), while total fatty acids varied from 22.55 to 440.69 mu g g(-1). The TOC/TN ratios and delta C-13 suggest a mixture of marine-and terrestrial-derived organic matter in the surface sediments with increasing contributions from marine-derived organic matter towards the seaward side. Long-chain n-alkanes derived from higher plants predominated the inner part of the estuary, while short-chain n-alkanes derived from planktonic sources predominated the bar mouth region. The even carbon preference of the C-12-C-22 n-alkanes may refer to the direct biogenic contribution from bacteria, fungi and yeast species and to the potential direct petroleum inputs. The presence of odd mid-chain n-alkanes in the sediments indicates the organic matter inputs from submerged and floating macrophytes (water hyacinth). Various molecular indices such as carbon preference index, terrestrial to aquatic ratio, average chain length and the ratios of mid-chain n-alkanes support the aforementioned inferences. The high contribution of odd and branched chain fatty acids along with very low contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggest the effective utilisation of algae-derived organic matter by bacteria and the effective recycling of labile organic matter in whole settling and deposition processes. The distributional variability of n-alkanes and fatty acids reveals the preferential utilisation of marine-derived organic matter and the selective preservation of terrestrial-derived organic matter in surface sediments of the Cochin estuary.

AB  - The current paradigm emphasizes the trophic role of epiphytic algae in seagrass-based food webs. However, a growing body of literature demonstrates that grazers would directly cause considerable damage to seagrass rather than targeting epiphytes, perhaps depending on seagrass traits. Here, we analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of macrozoobenthos, nekton and their potential organic carbon sources in Halophila ovalis seagrass bed and adjacent waters on the Hepu coast (Beihai, China) to test the hypothesis that Halophila with high nutritive values and fragile leaf-fracture traits may be a key carbon source. The delta C-13 values of most consumers either fell between H. ovalis (-14.7 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) and benthic microalgae (microphytobenthos and Halophila's epiphytes, -19.9 to -19.3 parts per thousand), or approached the delta C-13 of H. ovalis, suggesting that H. ovalis and microalgae is basal carbon sources in Halophila-based food web. Further quantification based on a 4-end-member MixSIAR model showed that H. ovalis is the most important basal carbon source, supporting 4 out of 6 trophic groups of macrozoobenthos, and 4 out of 7 nektonic trophic groups (a total of 22 species, accounting for 84.6% in nekton). The mean contribution was 37.2-75.3% for macrozoobenthos and 51.1-64.4% for nekton, respectively. Most macrozoobenthos directly or indirectly assimilated H. ovalis or its detritus and were then mainly utilized by nekton except for bivalves which largely fed on suspended microphytobenthos and particulate organic matter (POM), and porifera filtered POM. Our results re-examined the trophic function of seagrass in seagrass-based food web and emphasize the importance of protecting Halophila resources.

AB  - To examine the source and preservation of organic matter in the shelf sediments of the East China Sea (ECS), we measured bulk C/N and isotopes, organic biomarkers (n-alkanes and fatty acids) and compound-specific (fatty acids) stable carbon isotope ratios in three sediment cores collected from two sites near the Changjiang Estuary and one in the ECS shelf. Contrasting chemical and isotopic compositions of organic matter were observed between the estuarine and shelf sediments. The concentrations of total n-alkanes and fatty acids in the shelf surface sediments (0-2 cm) were 5-10 times higher than those in estuarine surface sediments but they all decreased rapidly to comparable levels below the surface layer. The compositions of n-alkanes in the estuarine sediments were dominated by C-26-C-33 long-chain n-alkanes with a strong odd-to-even carbon number predominance. In contrast, the composition of n-alkanes in the shelf sediment was dominated by nC(15) to nC(22) compounds. Long-chain (> C-20) fatty acids (terrestrial biomarkers) accounted for a significantly higher fraction in the estuarine sediments compared to that in the shelf sediment, while short-chain (< C-20) saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the shelf surface sediments than in the estuarine sediments. Stable carbon isotopic ratios of individual fatty acids showed a general positive shift from estuarine to shelf sediments, consistent with the variations in bulk delta(CTOCTOC)-C-13. These contrasts between the estuarine and shelf sediments indicate that terrestrial organic matter was mainly deposited within the Changjiang Estuary and inner shelf of ECS. Post-depositional diagenetic processes in the surface sediments rapidly altered the chemical compositions and control the preservation of organic matter in the region.

AB  - The origin and composition of sediment organic matter (SOM) were investigated together with its spatial distribution in the Arcachon Bay - a macrotidal lagoon that shelters the largest Zostera noltii meadow in Europe - using elemental and isotopic ratios. Subtidal and intertidal sediments and primary producers were both sampled in April 2009. Their elemental and isotopic compositions were assessed. Relative contributions of each source to SOM were estimated using a mixing model. The SOM composition tended to be homogeneous over the whole ecosystem and reflected the high diversity of primary producers in this system. On average, SOM was composed of 25% of decayed phanerogams, 19% of microphytobenthos, 20% of phytoplankton, 19% of river SPOM and 17% of macroalgae. There was no evidence of anthropogenic N-sources and SOM was mainly of autochthonous origin. None of the tested environmental parameters - salinity, current speed, emersion, granulometry and chlorophyll a - nor a combination of them explained the low spatial variability of SOM composition and characteristics. Resuspension, mixing and redistribution of the different particulate organic matters by wind-induced and tidal currents in combination with shallow depth probably explain the observed homogeneity at the whole bay scale.

AB  - Wetlands play an important role in global carbon (C) cycling. However, little is known about the effects of climate warming on wetland C cycling, which may bias our prediction of wetland functioning under global climate change. This study was undertaken to examine the potential changes in soil C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools and the related microbial activities after 7 years of in-situ experimental warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) in a Phragmites wetland in the Yangtze Estuary. The mean soil temperature, moisture, and salinity in both the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm soil layers were significantly increased by the warming treatment. In the upper 10 cm soil layer, significant increases in total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) were observed under the warming treatment, while the phenomenon were further clarified by comparing the year-round data in the warming plots between 2008 and 2015; However, the molar C/molar N ratio (C/N) and total phosphorus (TP) were not affected. In both layers, microbial biomass C (MBC) and the molar MBC/molar MBN ratio (MBC/MBN) showed no significant responses, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP) were increased by warming. Warming did not affect MBC/TOC, but it significantly increased both MBN/TN and MBP/TP throughout the 0-40 cm soil profile. Invertase activity was not affected in the 0-40 cm soil profile. The acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and urease activities in the upper 10 cm soil layer were increased by warming. Only alkaline phosphatase activity was increased by warming in the 10-40 cm soil layer. These field-experimental warming results suggested that in temperate P. australis wetlands without tidal impacts, climate warming might increase the soil organic C pools while exerting no effect on microbial C decomposition, whereas the N and P cycling that is mediated by soil microbes might be enhanced by moderate warming.

AB  - Several attempts have been made to find universal zonation schemes for the benthic fauna in sandy beaches. Usually, the nature and number of zones are not fixed and depend on the beach type and temporal changes in environmental characteristics. We characterized spatial and temporal variations in the structure of macrobenthic communities on an Amazonian macrotidal sandy beach (Farol Beach, Algodoal-Maiandeua Island, Brazil). Samples (macrobenthos and sediments) were collected during the rainy (March 2012 and 2013) and dry seasons (September 2011 and 2012) at six equidistant sites (50 m apart) from the high tide water mark to the swash zone. The physical gradients influenced the faunal distribution, with significant seasonal variations. Density and diversity increased seaward, while increasing moisture, organic matter content, and fine grains in sediments. Two faunal zonation schemes were observed. In the dry season, three faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal, mid-intertidal, and low-intertidal, whereas in the rainy season, only two faunal zones were distinguished: upper-intertidal and low-intertidal. In the rainy season, the physical gradients along the intertidal appeared to be smooth, allowing the expansion of the upper-tidal zone. This study provides novel insights into macrobenthic distribution patterns, reinforcing that tropical macrotidal beaches have unique characteristics that strongly influence macrobenthic distribution patterns.

AB  - Organic carbon was budgeted for an experimental marine ecosystem which received 21.2 mol C m-2 of allochthonous sewage sludge plus 12.4 mol C m-2 in situ net daytime production over a 99 day experiment.  The fate of carbon, in order of importance, was remineralization, storage in the sediments and export.  Sediment carbon metabolism was dominated by sulfate reduction which resulted in the dissociation of organic carbon remineralization from oxygen consumption and energy cycling.  The sediments were inefficient in processing sedimented carbon and its associated chemical energy.  About 70% of the energy reaching the sediments as organic carbon remained as accumulated carbon and sulfide minerals at the end of the experiment (71% of remaining energy was in the form of unrespired C and with the remaining 29% of energy stored as precipitated sulfides).  Sediment oxygen consumption was a poor estimator of benthic metabolism.  Total CO2 flux from the sediments was, however, balanced by the sum of sediment oxygen consumption plus oxygen equivalents stored as sedimentary sulfides.
   Sludge additions drove the experimental ecosystem to a eutrophic state with periods of severe oxygen depletion, death of macrofauna, hydrogen sulfide concentrations in excess of 1 mmolar in surface sediments, and the presence of a white filamentous bacterial mat over the sediment surface.

AB  - This study evaluated the burrowing activity of U. cordatus and its effects on Fe, Cu and Zn fractionation, bioavailability and bioaccumulation in a semiarid mangrove area (Ceara state, NE-Brazil). Were analyzed the Eh; pH; grain size and pore water composition; total S and organic C, and the speciation of Fe, Cu and Zn solid-phases in two areas: a densely populated crab and a control site. The burrowing activity and seasonal variation affect the biogeochemical conditions of mangrove soils increasing metals bioavailability and bioaccumulation. The crab burrows favors the entrance of oxygen into the soil, oxidizing the pyrite and forming poorly-crystalline Fe minerals, increasing the risks of biocontamination. Furthermore, the metals content in the hepatopancreas are a good proxy for the evaluation of bioavailable metal forms and, thus, further studies must be conducted in order to evaluate the potential use of U. cordatus as a bioindicator for trace metals contamination.

AB  - We conducted a 12-week field manipulation experiment in which we raised the nitrogen availability (ammonium sulfate fertilization to roots) and/or water potential (freshwater misting) of decaying leaf blades of a saltmarsh grass (smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora) in triplicate 11-m(2) plots, and compared the manipulated plots to unmanipulated, control plots. The ascomycetous fungi that dominate cordgrass leaf decomposition processes under natural conditions exhibited a boosting (>2-fold) of living standing crop (ergosterol content) by misting at the Ist week after tagging of senescent leaves, but afterwards, living-fungal standing crop on misted blades was equivalent to that on control blades, confirming prior evidence that Spartina fungi are well adapted to natural, irregular wetting. Misting also caused 2-fold sharper temporal declines than control in instantaneous rates of fungal production (ergosterol synthesis), 5-fold declines in density of sexual reproductive structures that were not shown by controls, and 2-fold higher rates of loss of plant organic mass. Extra nitrogen gave a longterm boost to living-fungal standing crop (about 2-fold at 12 weeks), which was also reflected in rates of fungal production at 4 weeks, suggesting that saltmarsh fungal production is nitrogen-limited. Although bacterial and green-microalgal crops were boosted by manipulations of nitrogen and/or water, their maximal crops remained less than or equal to 0.3 or 2% (bacteria or green microalgae, respectively) of contemporaneous living-fungal crop. The fungal carbon-productivity values obtained, in conjunction with rates of loss of plant carbon, hinted that fungal yield can be high (>50%), and that it is boosted by high availability of nitrogen. We speculate that one partial cause of high fungal yield could be subsidy of fungal growth by dissolved organic carbon from outside decomposing leaves.

AB  - The ecosystem associated to the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica shows a clear distinction in two subcompartments regarding turnover time: aboveground and belowground. Aboveground parts (leaves) are highly dynamic, and most of the leaf material is decomposed or exported in less than one year, representing a net loss of nutrients. In contrast, belowground biomass (roots and rhizomes) has a turnover time of the order of centuries, with a consequent accumulation of organic matter in the sediment. The accumulation rates for the single elements rank in the order C>N>P. This ecosystem may be considered as a sink for biogenic elements.

AB  - High concentrations (20-75 mu mol cm(-3)) of amorphous Fe(III) oxide were observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus effusus rhizosphere sediments of a freshwater wetland in the southeastern United States. Incubation experiments demonstrated that microbial Fe(III) oxide reduction suppressed sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in surface sediments and mediated greater than or equal to 40% of depth-integrated (0-10 cm) unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism, compared to less than or equal to 10% for sulfate reduction. In situ CO2 and CH4 flux measurements verified that nonmethanogenic pathways accounted for similar to 50% of unvegetated sediment carbon metabolism. Lower (similar to 10-fold) rates of dark/anaerobic CH4 flux from experimental vegetated cores relative to unvegetated controls suggested that methanogenesis was inhibited in the Juncus rhizosphere, in which active Fe(III) oxide reduction was indicated by the presence of low but readily detectable levels of dissolved and solid-phase Fe(II). Fe(III) oxide reduction accounted for 65% of total carbon metabolism in rhizosphere sediment incubations, compared to 22% for methanogenesis. In contrast, methanogenesis dominated carbon metabolism (72% of total) in experimental unvegetated sediment cores. The high Fe(III) oxide concentrations and reduction rates observed in unvegetated surface and Juncus rhizosphere sediments were perpetuated by rapid Fe(III) regeneration via oxidation of Fe(II) compounds coupled to O-2 input from the overlying water and plant roots, respectively. The results indicate that Fe(III) oxide reduction could mediate a considerable amount of organic carbon oxidation and significantly suppress CH4 production in freshwater wetlands situated within globally extensive iron-rich tropical and subtropical soil regimes.

AB  - A litter bag technique was used to measure root and rhizome decomposition and production f or 2 years in creekside and interior sediments in a Spartina alterniflora marsh on the seaside of the Delmarva Peninsula, Virginia, USA. Decay was equally rapid regardless of incubation in either creekside or interior sediments and did not vary with depth. Weight loss during the first growing season was 39 and 35 % (creekside and interior respectively). By the end of the second growing season between 81 and 88 % (creekside and interior respectively) of the starting root and rhizome material had decayed. In creekside sediments, very little root growth was measured during either year and root production was highly variable between years (1253 and 99 g m-2). In the interior marsh, the patterns of root growth and the amount of root material produced were similar each year (2016 and 2269 g M-2) . Root and rhizome turnover was faster in the creekside sediments (2.63 yr-1) than in the marsh interior (0.54 yr-1). The greater root production and slower root turnover in the interior marsh occurred in sediments with elevated salinities and oxidation-reduction potentials, and lower sediment saturation. These results suggest that differences in organic matter accumulation in high and low marsh areas may be explained by differences in root production and not differences in decay processes.

AB  - The texture and geochemical parameters of soil in tropical mangrove ecosystems have been broadly studied, but the effect of environmental stress on mangrove soil with different levels of disturbance has not been established. This study aimed to compare the texture and soil geochemistry of mangrove ecosystems with two levels of disturbance in the tidal basin of Agua Brava Lagoon, National Wetlands Nayarit, Mexico. Forty eight soil samples were collected from two areas of the mangrove ecosystem during an annual cycle; one in high mangrove condition (according to estimated Leaf Area Index) with low disturbance (LD) and the other in poor mangrove condition with high disturbance (HD). Generally, soil texture tends to be softer in LD than HD sites. LD sites had higher concentration of total N and P, organic matter (OM) and organic carbon (OC). HD sites presented an environmental stress with high levels of Ca, Na, salinity and conductivity. We identified four processes that dominate the dynamics of soil in the study area; MO, OC, N relationship and acid-base relationship. In conclusion, the soil conditions of LD and HD sites are dissimilar according to the level of mangrove disturbance, thus demonstrating the importance to maintain healthy mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - The South Carolina coastal plain is currently facing rapid population growth and suburbanization. Suburbanization brings the potential for surface- and ground water contamination from the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which can render water toxic to humans and fish, and lead to eutrophication. Additionally, nitrate is highly mobile in sediments and poses the potential for contamination of receiving waters, downstream areas, and ground water. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the differences in ground water quality and sediment denitrification rates at two sites, an undeveloped forested area (Oyster Creek, North Inlet, SC) and an area which has been developed for residential and commercial use (Dog Creek, Murrells Inlet, SC). Ground water monitoring wells were installed at the two sites at several sampling depths ranging from 0.6 m to 5 m. Ground water samples were collected every 4-8 weeks for 16 months, and analyzed in the field for pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO), and in the laboratory for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate and total organic carbon (TOC). Additionally, sediment samples were collected from two locations in both creek bottoms from approximately 1.0 m depth, and microbial denitrification was estimated using the acetylene block technique by measuring the accumulation of nitrous oxide (N2O). Ground water at both sites was microaerophilic, ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg O-2/l. Ammonia and TOC concentrations were significantly higher at the forested site due to higher inputs of organic matter in the form of leafy vegetation, whereas nitrate concentrations were significantly higher at the suburban site. Sediments from both sites were able to rapidly convert NO3 to N2O with progressive depletion of NO3 in extracted sediments. Both the rate of N2O production and the conversion efficiencies were found to increase with increasing nitrate concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/g. The smallest nitrate concentration had the lowest N2O production and NO3 conversion efficiency. However, for the intermediate treatment (0.25 mg/g) conversion efficiencies were variable. In addition to potential increased NO3 inputs, increased drainage for development present at suburban sites may cause aeration of near channel soils and favor the oxidized, more mobile form of nitrogen. Because the suburban site has steeper hydraulic gradients, and nitrate is highly mobile, there is potential for both nitrate transport to the estuary and accumulation in the shallow water-table aquifer at the suburban site. However, it appears that the microbial communities from both sites were well adapted to denitrifying inputs of nitrate in the concentration ranges tested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - We measured dissolved O-2 concentrations, pCO(2) values, and respiratory rates in five estuaries of the southeastern U.S. in October 1995 and July 1996. In the low-salinity sections of the coastal plain rivers, dissolved O-2 saturation states were typically only 50%, while pCO(2) values were over 4,000 mu atm. Respiratory rates measured concurrently in estuarine water averaged 8 and 23 mmol m(-3) d(-1) in October 1995 and July 1996, but they showed Little variability either within or among the five estuaries. Benthic chamber incubations in the adjacent intertidal marshes indicated fluxes of 30-40 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 50-120 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for O-2 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), respectively. For the Satilla River estuary, simple calculations revealed that neither respiratory activity in estuarine waters and sediments nor any other within-estuary process (not including the intertidal marsh system) was sufficient to account for the observed O-2 concentrations and pCO(2) values. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in four other southeastern U.S. estuaries fit the same general pattern as the Satilla, and likewise, within-estuary processes could not explain observed gas concentrations. Measured O-2 concentrations, pCO(2) values, pelagic respiratory rates, and benthic fluxes were used to construct a mass-balance model, focusing on the influence of the extensive intertidal marshes on O-2 and CO2 mass balance and water-atmosphere gas exchange in the five estuaries. Results indicate that respiratory activity in the sediments and overlying water of the marshes during high tide leaves a signal that is funneled back to the estuary during ebb tide and can account for the estuarine gas concentrations and fluxes. Both experimental and modeling approaches argue that the intertidal marshes of the southeastern U.S. export considerable amounts of inorganic respiratory products to the estuaries and that "outwelling" of organic matter to the estuaries is a minor process by comparison. The DIC exported to the coastal ocean, however, is only a small fraction of the total gas mass flow between the marsh, estuary, and atmosphere.

AB  - This study addresses deep pore water chemistry in a permeable intertidal sand flat at the NW German coast. Sulphate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients, and several terminal metabolic products were studied down to 5 m sediment depth. By extending the depth domain to several meters, insights into the functioning of deep sandy tidal flats were gained. Despite the dynamic sedimentological conditions in the study area, the general depth profiles obtained in the relatively young intertidal flat sediments of some metres depth are comparable to those determined in deep marine surface sediments. Besides diffusion and lithology which control pore water profiles in most marine surface sediments, biogeochemical processes are influenced by advection in the studied permeable intertidal flat sediments. This is supported by the model setup in which advection has to be implemented to reproduce pore water profiles. Water exchange at the sediment surface and in deeper sediment layers converts these permeable intertidal sediments into a "bio-reactor" where organic matter is recycled, and nutrients and DOC are released. At tidal flat margins, a hydraulic gradient is generated, which leads to water flow towards the creekbank. Deep nutrient-rich pore waters escaping at tidal flat margins during low tide presumably form a source of nutrients for the overlying water column in the study area. Significant correlations between the inorganic products of terminal metabolism (NH(4+) and PO(4)(3-)) and sulphate depletion suggest sulphate reduction to be the dominant pathway of anaerobic carbon remineralisation. Pore water concentrations of sulphate, ammonium, and phosphate were used to elucidate the composition of organic matter degraded in the sediment. Calculated C:N and C:P ratios were supported by model results.

AB  - There is an increasing recognition of the role coastal vegetated ecosystems play in atmospheric carbon sequestration. However, the development of sudden vegetation dieback (SVD), a phenomenon that causes the rapid death of Spartina altemiflora, followed by no or slow recovery, has affected large-scale alterations in Atlantic coastal systems. This study reports the effects of the development of SVD on the sediment microbial communities. In 1999, Hammonasset Beach State Park in Connecticut experienced the initial appearance of SVD. After more than a decade, the plants have not recovered. Yet, sediment chemistry was similar between vegetated and SVD affected sites, with the exception of water loading, which was significantly higher in the SVD affected sites. Soil CO2 flux, a proxy for soil respiration, was reduced by 64% in SVD sites compared with sites that remained vegetated. This suggests that SVD has affected large changes in carbon cycling in the wetland sediments. The microbial communities between vegetated and SVD sites were significantly different, as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The vegetated sediments harbored significantly higher populations of Bacteroidetes-related bacteria, whereas the SVD affected sediments contained a significantly enriched relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria, predominantly within the genus Desulfobulbus. Thus, the development of SVD appears to favor anaerobic metabolic pathways at the expense of saprophytes. Greenhouse experiments testing if the alterations in the sediment microbial communities were associated with differences in S. altemiflora germination or growth were also pursued. Although small differences in growth and disease ratings were noted between seedling and transplants grown in soil mix (control), autoclaved SVD sediments, or non-autoclaved (natural) SVD sediments, mortality was not significantly different, indicating that the alterations in the sediment communities are not likely responsible for SVD, or a primary cause for the failure of S. altemiflora to recolonize the SVD sites.

AB  - Purpose The Spartina alterniflora invasion across the southeast coast in China significantly reduced vegetation diversity and generated associated ecological problems. Sulfur (S) is a vital nutrient, while sulfide is phytotoxic and the impact of S. alterniflora invasion on soil S cycle remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the S cycle and associated soil microbial communities. Methods Both field investigation and lab-scale experiments were conducted, analyzing soil sulfide and sulfate contents, soil properties over four seasons in the Jiuduansha Wetland of Shanghai, China, the high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities, S cycle-related functional genes and seed germination experiments. Results The contents of sulfide, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in the bulk soil of S. alterniflora invaded area were higher than those in the native species S. mariqueter habitat and bare mudflat soils. Spartina alterniflora invasion increased the abundance of the Nitrospiraceae and Desulfarculaceae families and reduced that of Hydrogenophilaceae. The relative abundance of the SO42- reduction functional genes (dsrA + dsrB) in the soil was increased after S. alterniflora invasion, while that of the S oxidation functional genes (yedZ + soxY) in the soil was reduced. Seed germination experiments with different sodium sulfide concentrations (Na2S) revealed that the phytotoxicity of sulfide caused more lethal damage to S. mariqueter than to S. alterniflora. Conclusion The S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased SOC and TN contents and reduced the abundance of sulfur-oxidizing functional genes, which led to the accumulation of soil sulfide.

AB  - Although numerous studies have demonstrated that grazing significantly affects soil nutrients, plant biomass and soil microbial activities in grassland ecosystem, the responses of the relationships of soil nutrients with plant biomass and soil microbial activities to grazing intensities at a large scale are still unknown. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis across China's grasslands to address these questions. Our results suggested that different grazing intensities (low grazing (LG), medium grazing (MG) and high grazing (HG)) were closely related to plant biomass, soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial and enzyme activities. Specifically, MG significantly increased below-ground biomass (BGB). HG apparently decreased soil microbial activities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while LG showed the opposite results. The grazing-induced changes in plant biomass, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen might be the main underlying drivers that control the responses of SOC and TN to grazing intensities. The findings highlighted that LG was suitable for the sustainable development of China's grasslands and even worldwide dryland management.

AB  - Sea-level reconstruction from biological indicators in saltmarsh sediments requires an understanding of the modern ecology of the organisms concerned. Previous work suggested that testate amoebae are a potential new group of organisms to use for sea-level reconstruction, especially combined with diatoms and foraminifera. This paper analyses data from three saltmarshes on the Taf estuary, South Wales, the River Erme, Devon, and at Brancaster, Norfolk (UK) to (i) test for the presence and zonation of testate amoebae in relation to elevation; (ii) examine the similarity of zonation patterns between marshes; and (iii) explore the relationship between assemblage composition and a wider range of environmental variables. In addition we provide an update on the identification of testate amoebae on saltmarshes. Our results confirm that at all sites the primary environmental gradient is tidal inundation. Major changes in taxa along the tidal gradient are similar except for the lowest elevations, where different taxa become dominant at different sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) shows that assemblage composition is also strongly related to other variables, independent of the tidal position. Salinity, particle size and organic matter content are particularly important, and there is a statistically significant geographical effect on assemblages. Relationships between sea-level and assemblage composition are often stronger for individual sites, suggesting that local data sets should be used for quantitative sea-level reconstructions. However, the combined data set would provide more robust estimates of past sea-level change from fossil data. Other environmental variables explain as much of the variability in species assemblages as tidal parameters and should be considered more often in sea-level reconstructions based on microfossil indicators.

AB  - The Ashepoo-Combahee-Edisto (ACE) Basin (South Carolina, USA) National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) encompasses some of the least developed USA coastline. Yet, periodic sampling showed that certain regions have higher nutrient, fecal coliform, and chlorophyll a levels, often with lower dissolved oxygen, than other South Carolina estuaries. To evaluate the spatial extent of these issues, a summer (2008) baseline study was conducted. Physical water quality, total nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon, and suspended solids were measured from surface waters of 67 stations (30 tidal creek, 37 open water). Nutrient and chlorophyll a levels were significantly (p<0.01) and negatively correlated with the extent of open water (% land cover), and chlorophyll a and nitrogen levels were, at times, elevated relative to concentrations typical of other estuaries in the state, reinforcing previous findings. This survey also identified several creeks not previously monitored that exhibited elevated nutrients. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research on Indo-Pacific mangroves has confirmed the significant role played by grapsid crabs in the structure and function of these ecosystems. Through the feeding activities of the crabs, large proportions of organic matter production, i.e. mangrove leaves, are recycled within the forest. This initial retention of production in the forest refines earlier estimates of tidal export from the mangroves. Crab-processed organic matter could also form the basis of a coprophagous food chain involving small invertebrates, or be re-exported as micro-particulates. Differential consumption by crabs of mangrove propagules also affects mangrove community structure by diminishing the relative abundance of species whose propagules are preferred foods. Bioturbation by the crabs also results in changes in surface topography, particle size distribution and degree of aeration and, thus, the concentration of phytotoxins in the substratum. Such changes could affect growth and production of the mangroves. Growth and reproduction of the crabs may in turn be influenced by the associated mangrove species, mainly through the provision of food. The semi-terrestrial and air-breathing habit of the grapsid crabs probably makes them tolerant of deoxygenation caused by organic enrichment, but development of the landward mangroves will strongly affect survival of the crabs.

AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to assess site fidelity of Solea solea and Solea senegalensis juveniles, to investigate food web interactions and to determine the dominant nutrient pathways in two nursery areas in the Tagus estuary, Portugal. Samples of water from the main sources and from the nursery areas and respective saltmarsh creeks were collected for isotope analysis, as well as sediment, benthic microalgae, saltmarsh halophytes, S. solea, S. senegalensis and its main prey, Nereis diversicolor, Scrobicularia plana and Corophium spp. While site fidelity was high in 0-group juveniles, it was lower for 1-group juveniles, possibly due to an increase in mobility and energy demands with increasing size. Analysis of the food web revealed a complex net of relations. Particulate organic matter from the freshwater sources, from each nursery's waters and saltmarsh creeks presented similar isotopic composition. Sediment isotopic composition and saltmarsh halophytes also did not differentiate the two areas. All components of the food web from the benthic microalgae upwards were isotopically different between the nursery areas. These components were always more enriched in delta C-13 and delta N-15 at the lower nursery area than at the nursery located upstream, appearing as if there were two parallel trophic chains with little trophic interaction between each other. A mixture of carbon and nitrogen sources is probably being incorporated into the food web. The lower nursery area is more dependent upon an isotopically enriched energy pathway, composed of marine particulate organic matter, marine benthic microalgae and detritus of the C-4 saltmarsh halophyte Spartina maritima. The two nursery areas present a different level of dependence upon the freshwater and marine energy pathways, due to hydrological features, which should be taken into account for S. solea and S. senegalensis fisheries and habitat management.

AB  - To understand ecosystem functioning in coastal zones it is essential to identify the main pathways and magnitude of nutrient and organic matter fluxes. The different methods that have been applied to quantify material fluxes in tropical coastal ecosystems can be categorized into two fundamentally distinct approaches: direct flux measurements (Section 12.2) and chemical tracer techniques (Section 12.3). For direct flux measurements, the bidirectional flow of water is determined and multiplied with concentrations to obtain fluxes of inorganic nutrients or organic constituents. Water discharge can be measured directly with help of current meters and gauges, or indirectly through use of water tracers. The source of nutrients and organic matter can then be identified with help of specific chemical tracers, mainly isotopes or molecular properties. A combination of tracer techniques and direct flux measurements is most powerful to obtain quantitative information on the fluxes of organic matter and nutrients from the various sources in coastal systems but has very rarely been applied. Regarding source assessments of suspended and sedimentary organic matter, a large number of molecular biomarkers are readily available (Section 12.4). For dissolved organic matter, emerging molecular fingerprinting techniques including ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry may lead to major advances in the future.

AB  - Bioturbation by crabs may affect processes associated with organic matter decomposition in mangrove soils. This study examines how two crabs (Uca maracoani and Ucides cordatus), which are of substantial ecological and economic importance in semiarid coastal areas of Brazil, affect biogeochemical processes in mangrove soils. For this purpose, the physicochemical and geochemical parameters of the soils at different sites were analyzed. The redox potential was always positive at bioturbated sites (+12 to +218 mV), indicating more oxidizing conditions conducive to the oxidation of pyrite and precipitation of oxyhydroxides. In contrast, anoxic conditions prevailed at the control site (Eh < 0 mV), and the most abundant form of iron was Fe-pyrite. The highest degree of iron pyritization (DOP) was observed in soils from the control site (similar to 48%) and the lowest in the bioturbated soils (5-16%), indicating that crabs have an oxidative effect on iron sulfides. The results also suggest that U. cordatus has a higher oxidizing capacity than U. maracoani, probably because it constructs larger and deeper burrows. The results demonstrate that both crabs must be considered as important bioturbators in Brazilian semiarid mangrove soils, being capable of enhancing organic matter decomposition and also shifting the dominant pathway of organic matter degradation.

AB  - Estuaries are characterised by highly variable environmental conditions largely driven by tidal and atmospheric forces. This study investigates variation in the physical environment and the composition of the seston on various temporal scales in the Quempillen estuary, southern Chile. The water column was sampled throughout the tidal cycle at various times of the year. Total particulate matter, particulate inorganic matter, particulate organic matter, particle numbers, total particle volume, proximate biochemical composition and energy content of the seston, chlorophyll a and chloropigments were routinely measured. In each of the months in which sampling took place, two or three tidal cycles were examined. The information not only helps to explain the dynamics of the estuary, but is essential for an understanding of the physiology and ecology of the suspension-feeders which exploit the seston as a food source, the most dominant being the gastropod Crepipatella dilatata. Temperature and salinity were generally highest during summer, but seston quality, defined by energy content and biochemical composition (lipid, protein and carbohydrate) was higher at the end of winter and during spring. Chlorophyll a values were greatest in late spring (November). Many of the variables studied changed frequently according to the phase of the tidal cycle, and in several cases significant differences were observed among tidal cycles from the same month of the same year. In general the variables measured did not exhibit consistent patterns linked to the tidal cycle, possibly because any such patterns were masked by atmospheric conditions (wind and rain) that dominate the region and greatly influence the estuary. The quantity and quality of the seston available to suspension-feeders is largely determined by these atmospheric forces, which cause an influx of terrigenous material from adjacent areas and also resuspend bottom sediment. These effects are magnified by the shallowness of the estuary (< 2 m depth). The food supply for C. dilatata and other suspension-feeders therefore varies on temporal scales varying from hourly (tidal cycle) to daily/weekly (atmospheric forces) to monthly (seasonal influences), but inhibition of feeding by low salinity sometimes limits the ability of C. dilatata to exploit fully the available organic matter.

AB  - Plant pigments have been used as biomarkers of the presence of phototrophic organisms in rivers, estuaries and sea sediments in present and in paleolimnological studies. Chlorophyll a and lutein concentration, C/N ratio and organic matter content have been studied in the sediment of the Palmones River estuary (Algeciras Bay, Southern Spain). Using the concentration of these two pigments at different depths, as well as the sedimentation rate (determined by Rubio et al. in 2003 by means of the Pb-210 method), lutein and chlorophyll a degradation rate has been determined, in the saltmarsh. Lutein persistence in the sediment was higher than the persistence of chlorophyll a. According to these results, it was possible to discriminate the organic matter sources.

AB  - We assessed short-term temporal and spatial variation of metal contents in tile upper 100 cm sediment profile of intertidal marshes vegetated by common reed (Phragmites australis) along the Scheldt estuary in Belgium. The upper 0-100 cm sediment profile was sampled in three reedbeds at 56, 94, and 131 km from the river mouth. Sampling was repeated five times, at approximately two month intervals. Sediment properties such as texture and chloride, carbonate and organic matter content differed among locations. Metal accumulation, which is primarily due to association of metals with organic matter and clay in the surface sediment layer, seemed to be supplemented by an accumulation of sulphide precipitates deeper in the sediments. The depth at which sulphide precipitation significantly contributed to metal accumulation depended on the sampling location, and varied from less than 5 cm in clayey, organic sediments to more than 1 m in sandy sediments. Temporal variation of Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations could only be linked to newly formed sulphides or sulphide oxidation at the sites with the lowest sulphide content. At sampling sites containing high sulphide amounts, variations should be primarily attributed to metal exchange and the presence of mobile metal complexes. Litter decomposition at the end of the growing season could hereby play a significant role.

AB  - From summer 1996 through to autumn 1997 the seasonal changes of a macrofaunal assemblage, the nutritional value of organic matter (as content of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates) and the content of chlorophyll a in a Mediterranean mudflat were analysed. Sediment for macrofauna and biochemical analyses (chlorophyll a, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) was collected using a three-way nested sampling design. Results indicated differences in the composition of organic matter especially in summer 1997 and at all the other seasonal periods of sampling. In summer 1997 a sharp increase of protein concentration was measured. Chlorophyll a showed large fluctuations within seasons, especially during autumn and winter.
   Capitella cf. capitata, Pettiboneia urciensis, Streblospio shrubsolii, Desdemona ornata, Perinereis cultrifera, Abra segmentum and Oligochaeta dominated the assemblage. Species composition was different between autumn 1996 and 1997. Increasing abundance of Streblospio shrubsolii, Capitella cf. capitata and Desdemona ornata was found from summer through to autumn 1997. Oligochaeta increased in autumn 1997. Perinereis cultrifera and Abra segmentum fluctuated with high values in winter and spring.
   Significant correlation coefficients (P<0.05) were found for the abundance of Streblospio shrubsolii and Desdemona ornata with proteins in summer 1997 and for Perinereis cultrifera with chlorophyll a in autumn 1997. Correlations (at P<0.1) were also detected for Capitella cf. capitata with proteins in summer 1997 and for Perinereis cultrifera with chlorophyll a in winter.
   These results suggested that availability of sedimentary food resources might be important in regulating the dynamics of deposit feeders. Availability of nitrogen compounds (i.e. proteins) may regulate population growth during the warm season. Microalgae, as estimated by chlorophyll a, may be important for some selective deposit-feeders during the cold season. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Mosquito populations associated with the heavily urbanised Cooks River and Wolli Creek estuaries, Sydney, Australia, were investigated to assist in identifying potential pest and public health threats and assist local authorities in developing management strategies. Adult mosquitoes were sampled using carbon dioxide baited light traps at five locations, including two sites alongside Cooks River (Steel Park and Gough Whitlam Park), two sites alongside Wolli Creek (Jackson Track and Turella Reserve) as well as an additional location, Barton Park (Muddy Creek). These locations represented at least one of three distinct landscape characteristics, dominated either by bushland, parkland, or estuarine wetland habitats. Three trap sites were established at each location and sampling adult host-seeking mosquitoes took place on a weekly basis for 4 weeks. All mosquito specimens were identified to determine differences in relative abundance and community composition. There was a distinct difference in the abundance and community composition of mosquitoes collected between the five locations with the differences due to the presence and abundance of Aedes vigilax, Culex sitiens, Aedes notoscriptus Those locations close to estuarine wetlands were dominated by A. vigilax while other sites were dominated by mosquitoes associated with urban habitats such as stormwater infrastructure or backyard water-holding containers (e.g. A. notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus). Sites adjacent to urban bushland contained a higher species richness, but not necessarily greater abundance, of mosquitoes than other sites. This study provided an insight into mosquito populations within a previously unstudied area of Sydney and highlight that local authorities should carefully consider wetland management and urban planning strategies in the future to assist in identifying potential risks of nuisance-biting, mosquito-borne disease and in determining the need for further public health action.

AB  - We have analyzed our own data set as well as a number of previously published ones to examine factors related to the numbers and biomass of sediment bacteria in a variety of ecosystems. We have chosen to express sediment variables either on an areal or per unit sediment volume basis to avoid bias due to the more common standardization to sediment dry mass (also known as gram dry weight). Cross-system comparisons show that the amount of organic matter present and the sediment water content are important to sediment bacterial abundance. The C:N ratio of the sediment organic matter, possibly reflecting organic matter quality, was found to explain variation in bacterial numbers in addition to that explained by organic content. Over a broad range, sediment water content is related to sediment bacterial numbers in a unimodal fashion indicating dilution of sediments by water at high (> 80%) water content sites and dilution by inorganic particles at low (< 50%) water content sites. In lakes, the most important factors explaining sediment bacterial biomass were sediment water content and hydraulic flushing rate, a finding supported by analysis of an independent data set of English lakes. Planktonic chlorophyll a and planktonic bacterial numbers (both reflecting autochthonous organic matter levels) were not significantly related to sediment bacterial biomass. We found that sediments overlain by epilimnetic water had significantly higher bacterial biomass than those overlain by hypolimnetic water. A strong positive relationship between macrobenthos and sediment bacterial biomass was found for lakes in Ontario and Quebec. Calculations of annual bacterial production and P:B ratios necessary to sustain the macrobenthic population, based on the observed bacterial and macrobenthic biomass and temperature at our sites, indicate that the bacterial biomass present is more than sufficient to maintain the macrobenthos. In addition, based on the observed ratios of bacterial to detrital carbon at our sites and on a range of published assimilation efficiencies for macrobenthos grazing on these carbon sources, we calculated that the mean percentage of carbon of bacterial origin assimilatable by macrobenthos at our sites is 53% with a maximum of 79% and a minimum of 12%. Our results suggest a tighter trophic linkage between sediment bacteria and macrobenthos in our lakes than in most marine habitats, as indicated by published studies. From these analyses, the general picture emerges of a decoupling between pelagic and benthic bacterial processes in lakes, the pelagic ones being driven mainly by autochthonous production and the benthic ones by allochthonous inputs.

AB  - Wetlands cover a significant part of the world's land surface area. Wetlands are permanently or temporarily inundated with water and rich in nutrients. Therefore, wetlands equipped with Plant-Microbial Fuel Cells (Plant-MFC) can provide a new source of electricity by converting organic matter with the help of electrochemically active bacteria. In addition, sediments provide a source of electron donors to generate electricity from available (organic) matters. Eight lab-wetlands systems in the shape of flat-plate Plant-MFC were constructed. Here, four wetland compositions with activated carbon and/or marine sediment functioning as anodes were investigated for their suitability as a bioanode in a Plant-MFC system. Results show that Spartina anglica grew in all of the Plant-MFCs, although the growth was less fertile in the 100% activated carbon (AC100) Plant-MFC. Based on long-term performance (2 weeks) under 1000 ohm external load, the 33% activated carbon (AC33) Plant-MFC outperformed the other Plant-MFCs in terms of current density (16.1 mA/m(2) plant growth area) and power density (1.04 mW/m(2) plant growth area). Results also show a high diversity of microbial communities dominated by Proteobacteria with 42.5-69.7% relative abundance. Principal Coordinates Analysis shows clear different bacterial communities between 100% marine sediment (MS100) Plant-MFC and AC33 Plant-MFC. This result indicates that the bacterial communities were affected by the anode composition. In addition, small worms (Annelida phylum) were found to live around the plant roots within the anode of the wetland with MS100. These findings show that the mixture of activated carbon and marine sediment are suitable material for bioanodes and could be useful for the application of Plant-MFC in a real wetland. Moreover, the usage of activated carbon could provide an additional function like wetland remediation or restoration, and even coastal protection.

AB  - The sources of organic matter in the sediments from the Ord River and estuary were assessed using stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13), lipid biomarkers and distributions of chlorophylls and carotenoids as part of a larger multidisciplinary study exanunina the biogeochemistry of this tropical, macrotidal and large scale estuary. Two field trips were undertaken to obtain samples from both the dry (September, 2002) and wet (February, 2003) seasons. Both biomarker and stable isotope data indicate predominant contributions of organic material from the surrounding vegetation. However, the character of the terrestrial organic matter changes from the freshwater to the marine sections of the river. The sterol profiles in the freshwater sediments are relatively simple and dominated by the C-29 sterols 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (sitosterol) and 24-ethy,lcholesta-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol(stigmasterol) with small quantities of 24-methylcholest-5-en-3 beta-ol (campesterol), all of which are common sterols in higher plants. In the dry season survey, triterpenoid alcohols were generally absent from the freshwater sediments, but in the wet season there was a small contribution from compounds such as alpha- and beta-amyrin and lupeol, indicating additional higher plant input, possibly from further inland in the catchment. Within Cambridge Gulf and the Ord estuary, the waterways are fringed with mangroves which contribute substantial quantities of organic matter as shown by distinctive distributions of triterpenoid alcohols dominated by taraxerol. However, this is not the major triterpenoid in the mangrove trees studied, but seems to be considerably more stable to biodegradation and so dominates the triterpenoids found. Isotope, biomarker (fatty acids, phytol and sterols) and pigment data suggest that only a small part of the sedimentary organic matter is derived from microalgae. Contributions from diatoms (24-inethvlcholesta-5,22E-dien-3 beta-ol; fucoxanthin), green algae (A Delta(7) sterols), cyanobacteria (C-32 hopanol; zeaxanthin) and dinoflagellates (dinosterol; peridinin) could be recognized. In this environment the high turbidity of the water column severely limits phytoplankton production, although productivity of microphytobenthos on the banks of the river can potentially be high.

AB  - The sediment dynamics and the long-term evolution of intertidal environments depend on the erosion threshold, which is often increased by microbial biofilms. Intertidal biostabilization has been well studied in temperate and subtropical environments, but little is known for subarctic conditions with strong seasonal changes in vegetation cover and sea ice presence in winter because of the difficulty in studying the sediments under ice cover. The present project investigated the role of biofilms and their seasonal as well as spatial variations for sediment biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal area near Rimouski (Quebec, Canada). Grain size distribution reflected a seaward increasing trend in sand content and mean grain size. The poor sorting of sediments results from the contribution of sediment transport by ice rafting in addition to the hydrodynamic transport processes in this subarctic intertidal area. A Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) was used to measure the erosion threshold (tau(crit)) across the entire intertidal area. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and extra polymeric substances (EPS) were measured in the top 3 mm. The high marsh had a far higher tau(crit) than the low marsh, but there was much less variation between low marsh, mudflat and sandflat. tau(crit )was significantly correlated with Chl a, elevation, and organic matter content. EPS was not a good indicator for tau(crit), except for the low marsh/high marsh difference. The results showed a seasonal cycle in intertidal bed emdibility. Lower intertidal areas had highest tau(crit) in autumn during the storm season, followed by lowest tau(crit) in winter under sea-ice cover, and no major difference between summer and spring. This study highlights the characteristics of cold climate intertidal areas, where low temperatures in autumn and land-fast ice cover during winter severely affect biofilms and intertidal vegetation, and ultimately their capacity to shield sediments from erosion.

AB  - Grand Bay estuary in coastal Mississippi and Alabama (USA) has undergone significant geomorphic changes over the last few centuries as a result of anthropogenic (bridge, road, and hardened shoreline construction) and climatic (extreme storm events) processes, which reduce freshwater input, sediment supply, and degrade barrier islands. To investigate how geomorphic changes may have altered the Grand Bay estuary, sediment push cores were collected for foraminiferal, sedimentological (organic matter content, grain-size distribution), and radiochemical (Pb-210,Cs-137, and Be-7) analyses. Clay normalized geochronologies were determined with a constant rate of supply model. Based on downcore age-depth relationships, select intervals were analyzed for foraminifera in order to assess alterations in the microfossil assemblage in Grand Bay estuary over the 20th Century. All estuarine samples were low diversity (species richness: 1-10; Fisher's alpha diversity: 0.14-1.75); two species, Ammotium salsum and Paratrochammina simplissima, dominated all downcore assemblages. Paratrochammina simplissima increased in abundance up-core from a minor subsidiary species (median = 4.7% at 19-20 cm) to dominant or co-dominant with A. salsum over the 20th and early 21st Centuries in six cores, comprising up to 60.7% of a single sample. The emerging dominance of P. simplissima since similar to 1950 along with the reduction of brackish-estuarine taxa and introduction of calcareous species signifies increased salinity and less marsh organic matter preserved in the sediments. While seasonal dissolution limits our ability to chronologically constrain the introduction of calcareous species, P. simplissima, a species not referenced in taxonomic data from the northern Gulf of Mexico until 2012, is well constrained, following its first occurrence in the 1930s.

AB  - Postlarvae of Penaeus vannamei were fed various diets in order to examine the importance of detritus and other possible prey items in supporting postlarval growth. Stable isotopes (C and N) were used to determine the carbon and nitrogen source of the prey in the various diets. The zooplankton diet contained mostly copepods. The subtidal detritus treatment consisted mostly of plant material whereas the diets from both intertidal sites contained a mixture of plant detritus and associated meiofauna. Postlarvae reared on zooplankton and detritus plus meiofauna diets more than tripled their weight during a 6-day period. In contrast, postlarvae fed the detritus diet barely doubled their weight. Based on isotopic composition, postlarvae appear to obtain their carbon and nitrogen from various food sources. Postlarvae were enriched by 0.4 parts per thousand in C-13 and 2.7 parts per thousand in N-15 relative to the zooplankton diet, which is consistent with isotopic fractionation between successive trophic levels. In rum, the isotopic signal of the zooplankton was consistent with phytoplankton being the initial source of organic matter. In contrast, mean delta(13)C values of the shrimp fed detritus plus meiofauna were significantly different from their respective diets. Isotopic ratios of the postlarvae fed the mixed diet from Chomes were two trophic levels above benthic algae suggesting that the shrimp preyed on organisms that derived their carbon and nitrogen from benthic algae and/or phytoplankton.

AB  - The role and quatitative importance of free-living nematodes in marine and estuarine soft sediments remain enigmatic for lack of empirical evidence on the feeding habits and trophic position of most nematode species. Here we use natural abundances of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of some abundant nematode species/genera from estuarine intertidal sediments to assess their trophic level and major food sources. In all stations, delta(15)N of different dominant nematode species/genera spanned a range of 3.6 to 6.3 ppt, indicating that at least two trophic levels were represented. The large nematodes Enoplus brevis, Enoploides longispiculosus and Adoncholaimus fuscus consistently had high delta(15)N, in line with mouth-morphology based predictions and empirical evidence on their predacious feeding modes. Daptonema sp., Metachromadora remanei, Praeacanthonchus punctatus and 'Chromadoridae' (dominated by Ptycholaimellus ponticus) had comparatively lower delta(15)N, and delta(13)C suggesting that microphytobenthos (MPB) is their major carbon source, although freshly sedimented particulate organic matter may also contribute to their nutrition in silty sediments. The trophic position of Sphaerolaimus sp., a genus with documented predacious ecology mode, was ambiguous. Ascolaimus elongatus elongatus had delta(15)N signatures indicating a predacious ecology, which is at variance with expectations from existing feeding type classifications. Our study shows that despite limitations imposed by the biomass requirements for EA-IRMS (elemental analyser-isotope ratio mass spectrometry)-natural isotope abundances of carbon and nitrogen are powerful tools to unravel trophic structure within nematode communities. At the same time, the prominence of different trophic levels results in a large span of delta(15)N, largely invalidating the use of nitrogen isotype abundances to assess food sources and trophic level of whole nematode communities.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of liming in combination with vegetation for the recovery of slightly acidic, saline soils of eutrophic wetlands affected by mine wastes, under fluctuating flooding conditions. Simulated soil profiles were constructed and four treatments were assayed under greenhouse conditions: control, only plant, only liming, and liming and plant. The plant species was the halophyte Sarcocornia fruticosa. Three horizons were differentiated: A (never under water), C1 (alternating flooding-drying conditions), and C2 (always under water). The pH, Eh, salinity, and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and soluble metals were measured regularly for 18 weeks. Liming favoured the growth of S. fruticosa, an increase in pH and a fall in Eh. The amendment was effective for reducing Mn, Zn, and Cd in pore water of bare soils, but not Cu and Pb. In the treatment with liming and plant, the growth of S. fruticosa counteracted the effect of the amendment, strongly increasing the concentrations of metals in pore water and distributing them along the soil profile. Hence, the combined use of liming and plants may increase the risk of metals mobilisation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to investigate spatial and temporal changes of soil phosphorus and its availability in coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Estuary, soil samples from five sampling sites (Sites 1-5) in four sampling periods were collected and the contents of soil phosphorus and other properties were detected. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in total phosphorus (TP) in surface and subsurface soils among the five sampling sites (p > 0.05), whereas significant differences were observed between June and other months (p < 0.05) following the order June > August > November > April. Generally, available phosphorus (AP) contents also showed a fluctuation in different sampling periods and there were significant differences between November and August and April at 10-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). The soil P supply was generally lower with lower AP:TP ratios less than 2%. Spatial changes along the sampling belt in AP: TP ratios were similar in surface soils except for April, whereas they decreased in subsurface soils in June and November, and fluctuated slightly in August and April. Lower C:P ratios (<50) in coastal wetland soils contributed to soil P mineralization. Spatial changes in the C:P ratios were similar the surface soils in four sampling periods, and the reverse changing tendencies were observed in subsurface soils between April and June and between August and November. Correlation analysis showed that TP had significant positive correlations with Al, Mg and bulk density and negative correlations with soil moisture and C:P ratio (p < 0.01). Comparatively, AP was just significantly correlated with soil organic matter. The findings indicated that seasonal changes in soil P should be given more concerns to minimize the eutrophication risk of water bodies in coastal wetlands and guide the flow and sediment regulation regime of the upstream reservoir.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera identified from the upper intertidal zone of coastal mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands of south-eastern Australia exhibit spatial zonation that varies with elevation and corresponds to position in the tidal frame. This study describes relationships between benthic foraminiferal assemblages and environmental variables, such as wetland elevation, pore-water salinity, substrate organic matter content and sediment grainsize. Agglutinated taxa dominated higher in the tidal frame, whereas calcareous taxa increased in both relative abundance and diversity lower in the tidal frame. Species composition varied within and between study sites, reflecting local differences in other environmental variables. Three major spatial clusters were identified in the upper intertidal zone from a dataset consisting of 111 contemporary samples: a high-to mid-elevation assemblage consisting of differing abundances of Entzia macrescens and Trochammina inflata; a mid-elevation assemblage comprised of Arenoparrella mexicana in association with Trochammina inflata and Quinqueloculina seminula; and mid-to low-elevation assemblage characterised by Cribroelphidium excavatum, Quinqueloculina seminula, Ammobaculites spp. and Miliammina fusca. Multivariate analysis correlated foraminiferal assemblages with environmental variables showing that foraminiferal distribution in the region is constrained primarily by wetland elevation, but also by pore-water salinity. Foraminiferal assemblages derived from cluster analysis correlated with vegetation zones, implying that both foraminifera and vegetation are influenced by elevation and salinity. This paper seeks to demonstrate that the consistency in spatial zonation of assemblages provides greater confidence that contemporary distribution of foraminiferal assemblages can assist with the interpretation of past depositional conditions and palaeo-environmental reconstructions, providing insights into the evolution of coastal wetlands of south-eastern Australia over the Holocene.

AB  - Four sites were investigated along the salinity gradient in the estuary of the River Colne, UK. Sulphate reduction rates at all sites decreased with depth in the sediment, but the annual rate of sulphate reduction over the 0 to 20 cm profile did not decrease significantly, even at a low salinity site up the estuary where sulphate concentrations were much lower than at the estuary mouth. Methane was formed at all of the sites, at rates 2 orders of magnitude lower than sulphate reduction, and was greatest at a site on the marsh top site where organic matter was high. Methane emissions to the atmosphere were substantially lower than sedimentary methanogenesis, suggesting methane oxidation occurred in the sediments before emission, with the proportion oxidized before emission increasing down the estuary. Nucleic acids were extracted from the sediments at each site, slot-blotted onto nylon membranes, and 16S rRNA quantified with radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes against different groups of sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). Autoradiographs were quantified by laser densitometry compared to known standards of RNA, and expressed as a percentage of the signal from a total bacterial probe. The 4 SRB genera analysed (Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacter, Desulfobulbus and Desulfobacterium) were all detected at all 4 sites. Desulfovibrio was the largest group of SRB at the 3 lower estuary sites, while Desulfobacter, which appeared to be the major acetate utiliser present along the estuary, and Desulfobulbus were detected at lower levels. Signal from the physiologically diverse Desulfobacterium occurred at significantly higher levels in the upper estuary at the Hythe, and it was possible that this was associated with its use of electron acceptors other than sulphate, such as nitrate.

AB  - The passage of hurricane Andrew across the Louisiana coastal zone in 1992 was used to study the effects of hurricane sedimentation on estuarine marshes. (1) The thickness and nutrient content of hurricane sediments, (2) the composition of hurricane sediments relative to pre-existing sediments, and (3) the relationship between hurricane sedimentation and small-scale heterogeneity in the emergent plant community were investigated. Vertical accretion resulting from the hurricane was 4-11 times greater than the long-term (30 year) annual rate. The hurricane sediments will be within the root zone of emergent vegetation for 35-50 years, depending on the local marsh vertical accretion rate. Element concentration, organic matter content, and texture of hurricane sediments varied over a wide area, which suggested that hurricane sediments did not originate from a common sediment pool. The concentration of most elements analysed did not differ between hurricane sediments and pre-existing sediments, which suggested that hurricane sediments originated primarily from the same local bays and lakes that provide material for other sedimentation events. Hurricane sediments were thicker in Juncus roemerianus stands than in surrounding Spartina alterniflora stands. Greater hurricane sedimentation in J. roemerianus stands was attributed to greater stem density there and may help maintain plant community heterogeneity if J. roemerianus is less flood-tolerant than S. alterniflora, as previous work suggests. Previous studies have noted the effect of environmental gradients on plant species distribution, but our data indicate that plant species can also generate different environmental conditions associated with their distribution.

AB  - The export of detritus and faunal biomass from mangroves has long been considered as an important support for offshore biological production and has been widely used as an argument for mangrove conservation. This functional role of the mangroves, like many other paradigms in mangrove ecology, has seldom been put to rigorous test since the hypothesis was postulated about 25 years ago. Past studies on which the hypothesis was based were mostly carried out in mangrove or other wetland environments, little is known about the fate and effects of outwelled detritus on oceanic, offshore, communities. Mass balance studies carried out in the last 15 years tend to suggest that export is common from tidal mangroves, the direction of flow depends, however, on the identity of the chemical species in question. Pore water and groundwater flow can affect tidal material exchange but are poorly studied. Generally, tracer methods using stable isotope ratios or other signatures have suggested that outwelling may be much less significant than expected. Further, most past studies have focussed on particulate matter while it is increasingly apparent that dissolved organics may play a more important role in matter exchange between offshore and mangrove communities. There is also evidence that benthic biomass and richness may not bear any positive or significant relationship with detritus availability.

AB  - 1. Ecological replacement using native mangrove species combined with physical treatments has become an effective method in controlling the spread of invasive cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. To re-establish ecosystem functions, trophic interactions between macrofauna and their potential food resources must be considered during the restoration process.
   2. Here, we examined the changes in the diets of macrofauna in three restored mangrove ecosystems with different invasion histories following the removal of S.alterniflora in southern China. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios for dominant macrofauna, as well as their potential food sources, were analysed. The relative contributions of the different carbon sources to the diets of benthic macrofauna and isotopic niche width, including convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas of the macrofaunal community, were then calculated and compared among sampling sites in each region.
   3. Our results indicated that Spartina-derived detritus contributed to >80% of the organic carbon sources of dominant macrofauna in the S.alterniflora communities in all three regions. Spartina alterniflora communities had lower convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas than natural mangrove forests, indicating significant resource competition among different consumer populations. Replacing S.alterniflora with the native mangrove species Kandelia obovata could reverse the diets of these macrofaunal species, resulting in a shift from homogeneous Spartina-dominated diets to more heterogeneous algae-based diets. It could take several decades to restore food web interactions to a pre-impacted state. Even the diets of macrofauna in mature mangrove (>40years) remained affected by the Spartina-derived organic matter.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that the ecological replacement of invasive Spartina alterniflora using native mangrove species could restore food web function gradually. However, this removal and replacement approach is a long process and requires significant manpower and resources. Furthermore, the native ecosystem will continue to be influenced by the cordgrass as long as large areas of wetland nearby are occupied by S.alterniflora. Consequently, preventing the colonization of S.alterniflora should be a priority for coastal ecosystem management in southern China.

AB  - Hydrodynamic differences among shorelines with no vegetation, reference vegetation (mature mangrove), and vegetation planted on restored shoreline (marsh grass and young mangrove) were compared based on field observations 6.5 years after living shoreline restoration. Mean current velocities and waves were more strongly attenuated in vegetation (from channel to shoreline: 80-98% velocity decrease and 35-36% wave height reduction) than in bare shoreline (36-72% velocity decrease, 7% wave height reduction, ANOVA: p < 0.001). Normalized turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were significantly higher in reference vegetation (0.16 +/- 0.03 m(-1)) than in restored (0.08 +/- 0.02 m(-1)) or bare shoreline (0.02 +/- 0.01 m(-1), p < 0.001). Significant differences in the current attenuation and turbulence dissipation rates for the reference and planted vegetation are attributed to the observed differences in vegetation array and morphology. Although the hydrodynamic analyses did not suggest limitations to recruitment, mangrove seedlings were not observed in restored vegetation, while four recruited seedlings/m were counted in the reference vegetation. The lack of recruitment in the restored shoreline may suggest a lag in morphological habitat suitability (slope, sediment texture, organic matter content) after restoration. Although hydrodynamics suggest that the restored site should be functionally similar to a reference condition, thresholds in habitat suitability may emerge over longer timescales.

AB  - In this paper we investigated the role of competition to determine Bacopa monnieri L. Pennel (Plantaginaceae) zonation in a temporarily open/closed tropical estuary. In this estuary, B. monnieri occupies a given vertical zone in the saline stretch, where it forms dense monospecific stands, but is absent elsewhere. We transplanted turfs to areas outside of their natural occurrence in the estuary, both in the presence and absence of competition: a higher-elevation zone, a lower-elevation zone and a non-saline region. Turfs transplanted between naturally occurring stands served as controls. Turfs transplanted to the lower zone either died or became much smaller. As there was no competition under this condition, we conclude that the absence of this species from this zone is due to abiotic conditions, likely light limitation imposed by the turbid water column. Turfs transplanted to the higher zone under competition died; however, in the absence of competition, they survived. Turfs transplanted to the non-saline zone died, regardless of the presence or absence of competition, indicating an abiotic restraint. Our results indicate that the absence of B. monnieri from higher elevations is related to competitive displacement, whereas its absence from lower elevations and from non-saline areas is related to abiotic drivers.

AB  - Plant invasions represent a major global change in land/vegetation coverwith the potential to significantly modify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To get a better understanding of the impacts of terrestrial invasive plants on soil GHG emissions we report, firstly, on experiments conducted on invasive populations of the N-fixing herbaceous species Gunnera tinctoria in Ireland, and secondly, compare our results with published information based on a systematic reviewof the literature. For G. tinctoria populations, therewas a >50% reduction in soil CO2 emissions, mainly due to a reduction in autotrophic respiration, but with little impact on annual N2O or CH4 budgets. One year after the removal of G. tinctoria, soil GHG emissions returned to values comparable to uninvaded areas and thiswas associatedwith the reestablishment of the vegetation and an increased root biomass per unit area. If G. tinctoria covered 10% of abandoned agricultural land in Ireland, this could be associatedwith a reduction of approximately 8% (or 4.988 Mt CO(2)eq y(-1)) of the country's national CO2 emissions. Comparisons of these results with literature values were difficult because of the often low and limited sampling effort of previous investigations, a failure to assess all three major GHGs and because of marked seasonal variations. We found 46 studies that documented results for 16 species. From the studies that measured soil respiration, it was enhanced in only 45% of cases, questioning the assumption that invasive plants always increase soil CO2 emissions. In 25 cases that analysed methane, CH4 emissions increased in 76% of them, but all of these were conducted in wetlands. In only two cases were N-fixing species associated with enhanced N2O emissions. Our results argue for more detailed and comprehensive assessments of the effect of plant invasions on GHG emissions and their global impact. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Australia's developed coasts are a heavily competed space, subject to urban, industrial and agricultural development. A diversity of habitats, such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses, comprise Australia's coastal seascape and provide numerous benefits including fish productivity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, coastal protection and recreation. Decision makers need to be able to weigh up the relative costs and benefits of coastal development, protection or repair and to do this they need robust, accessible and defensible data on the ecological function and economic value of Australia's coastal seascapes. We reviewed the published literature, with a focus on saltmarsh as a vulnerable ecological community, to determine the availability of information on key ecological functions that could inform ecosystem service valuation. None of the publications we reviewed quantified nutrient cycling, coastal protection or recreation functions. Only 13 publications presented quantitative information on carbon sequestration and fish productivity. These were limited geographically, with the majority of studies on sub-tropical and temperate saltmarsh communities between south-east Queensland and Victoria. This demonstrates a lack of quantitative information needed to substantiate and communicate the value of Australia's saltmarshes in different locations, scales and contexts. Research should focus on addressing these knowledge gaps and communicating evidence in a relevant form and context for decision-making. We discuss four principles for research funding organisations and researchers to consider when prioritising and undertaking research on key ecological functions of Australia's saltmarshes, and coastal seascapes more broadly, to support sustainable coastal development, protection and repair for long-term economic and community benefit.

AB  - In order to determine terrestrial contributions to the organic matter pool in the marine environment, a reliable chemical tracer is required. Lignin, an abundant component of vascular plant tissue is often used as such. In this study the lignin moiety of both fresh and degraded tissue of the model halophyte Spartina anglica was purified and chemically characterized to investigate its suitability as tracer. The study can be split into three parts. In the first part several enzymatic lignin purifications of fresh S. anglica tissue were compared with each other. In the second part pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry was applied to analyse untreated and on-line methylated milled wood lignin preparations. The previous characterizations of the lignin moiety of S. anglica were used in the third part to monitor modifications in the chemical composition induced by natural aerobic decomposition in the field.
   The temperature at which lipids were extracted from the original tissue was not critical, although low temperatures improved the purification to some extent. For enzymatic purification of lignin the use of a polysaccharidase turned out to be the most important prerequisite. The use of a protease did not have much influence on the lignin residue. After 2 yr of aerobic decomposition, the lignin character of untreated S. anglica tissue was no longer identifiable with direct temperature-resolved mass spectrometry, but it still could be retrieved in the residue obtained after enzyme treatment. With continuing decomposition the chemical structure of the lignin moieties became partly modified. The very complicated spectra obtained after longer decomposition periods suggest the formation of a heterogeneous organic fraction, probably representing "humic substances". The gradual loss of lignin characteristics in the litter makes its suitability as tracer for terrestrial material in a complex mixture of substances doubtful, at least with the analytical technique applied in this study.

AB  - Mitigation wetlands are expected to compensate for the loss of structure and function of natural wetlands within 5-10 years of creation; however, the age-based trajectory of development in wetlands is unclear. This study investigates the development of coupled structural (soil properties) and functional (nitrogen cycling) attributes of created non-tidal freshwater wetlands of varying ages and natural reference wetlands to determine if created wetlands attain the water quality ecosystem service of nitrogen (N) cycling over time. Soil condition component and its constituents, gravimetric soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total N, generally increased and bulk density decreased with age of the created wetland. Nitrogen flux rates demonstrated age-related patterns, with younger created wetlands having lower rates of ammonification, nitrification, nitrogen mineralization, and denitrification potential than older created wetlands and natural reference wetlands. Results show a clear age-related trajectory in coupled soil condition and N cycle development, which is essential for water quality improvement. These findings can be used to enhance N processing in created wetlands and inform the regulatory evaluation of mitigation wetlands by identifying structural indicators of N processing performance.

AB  - Wastewater discharge from shrimp farming is one of the main causes of eutrophication in mangrove ecosystems. We investigated the phosphorus (P) geochemistry in mangrove soils affected by shrimp farming effluents by carrying out a seasonal study of two mangrove forests (a control site (CS); a site affected by shrimp farm effluents (SF)). We determined the soil pH, redox potential (Eh), total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved P. We also carried out sequential extraction of the P-solid phases. In SF, the effluents affected the soil physicochemical conditions, resulting in lower Eh and higher pH, as well as lower TOC and higher TP than in CS. Organic P forms were dominant in both sites and seasons, although to a lesser extent in SF. The lower TOC in SF was related to the increased microbial activity and organic matter decomposition caused by fertilization. The higher amounts of P oxides in SF suggest that the effluents alter the dominance of iron and sulfate reduction in mangrove soils, generating more reactive Fe that is available for bonding to phosphates. Strong TP losses were recorded in both sites during the dry season, in association with increased amounts of exchangeable and dissolved P. The higher bioavailability of P during the dry season may be attributed to increased mineralization of organic matter and dissolution of Ca-P in response to more oxidizing and acidic conditions. The P loss has significant environmental implications regarding eutrophication and marine productivity.

AB  - This study is focused on determining the response behaviour of five saline plant communities to two environmental variables: flooding and salinity. Also, total soil organic carbon, diversity, plant cover and vegetation height were measured. Once this behaviour is known, the impacts of future climate scenarios may be approached. Since some of these variables could be altered by climate change, the future vegetation dynamics might indicate the trending of change, so plant communities can be used as bioindicators. The investigation was carried out in some small coastal wetlands located in a semiarid Mediterranean region. Low values of diversity were found in these plant communities due to a great effect of flooding, followed by salinity. 'Reed beds' are bioindicators of flooding and environmental disturbance. 'Saline rushes' are also flooding bioindicators and efficient accumulators of organic matter. 'Mediterranean halophilous scrubs' are bioindicators of seasonal flooding and changes to salinity. 'Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous scrubs' might be considered as bioindicators of low flooding and low salinity in anthropic environment while 'Mediterranean salt steppes' bioindicate driest conditions. At present, Mediterranean halophilous scrubs are the most widely extended community, which could be interpreted as a consequence of a changing and sharply seasonal climate. Our research suggests that future climate change scenarios involving flooding increases would support the proliferation of the lowest diversity and thus lower ecological value plant communities (i.e. reed beds). Conversely, a future scenario of decreasing flooding would benefit the most diverse and valuable conservation community actually priortized by European Habitats Directive (Mediterranean salt steppes, Limonietalia).

AB  - N-2 flux rates (net denitrification) were measured over a diel cycle, seasonally, in 12 benthic habitats across three warm temperate Australian coastal systems. Dark N-2-N fluxes were strongly controlled by sediment oxygen demand (SOD) across the 3 estuaries, 4 seasons, and 12 benthic habitats (r(2)=0.743; p<0.001; n=142; slope=0.0170). However, some of the slopes differed significantly between seasons and among estuaries and habitats, and all of the slopes were correlated with the C-13 values and C:N ratios of sediment organic matter. Ternary mixing diagrams with the contribution of algal, seagrass, and terrestrial/mangrove material to sediment organic matter showed that habitats, seasons, and estuaries dominated by a mixture of seagrass and algal material had the lowest slopes, and slopes increase as habitats, seasons, and estuaries have an increasing contribution from terrestrial/ mangrove material. Overall, the slopes of dark N-2 fluxes versus SOD were low compared to previous studies, most likely due to either, or a combination of, the C:N ratio of the organic matter, the mixture of C:N ratios making up the organic matter, the structure of the organic matter, and/or the SOD rates. This study demonstrated that it is not only the quantity but also the type (quality), and maybe the mixture, of organic matter that is an important control on denitrification. As such, rapid global changes to detrital sources to coastal systems due to losses of mangrove, seagrasses, and saltmarshes, and associated increases in algae and macrophytes, are also expected to impact system level losses of nitrogen via denitrification.

AB  - The oxidation of organic carbon by bacteria in tropical seagrass communities was studied in austral summer 1986-87. The major seagrass species were Enhalus acoroides, Syringodium isoetifolium, Cymodocea serrulata, Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata. Seagrass gross productivity, determined by a lacunal gas technique, ranged from 0.5 to 4.3 g C m-2 d-1. In comparison, gross community productivity, measured from diurnal changes in O2 concentration in the water column, ranged from 4 to 9 g C m-2 d-1. Macroalgae, epibenthic and epiphytic algae made the major contribution to gross primary production in the communities studied, contributing 40 to 90 % of gross primary production. Most of the primary production was utilized by hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria and was ultimately oxidized by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Hydrolytic (aerobic) and fermentative bacterial productivity, determined from rates of incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA, ranged from 3 to 13 g C m-2 d-1 (integrated over a depth of 12 cm in the sediment). The highest rates of sulphate reduction, determined with S-35, coincided with the below-ground distribution of seagrass roots and rhizomes. Between 1.7 and 2.2 g C m-2 d-1 was oxidized to CO2 by the sulphate-reducing bacteria; this is equivalent to 30 to 80 % of the net community productivity.

AB  - The goals of this study were to quantify organic matter source utilization by consumers in the freshwater-dominated region (East Bay) of a high river flow estuary and compare the results to consumers in marine-influenced sites of the same estuary to understand how organic matter utilization by consumers may be changing along the salinity gradient. We used the results from these evaluations to establish the baseline against which we isotopically determined trophic level for consumers in East Bay. Average isotope values for consumers sampled in East Bay ranged from -20.1aEuro degrees to -24.8aEuro degrees for carbon and from 8.9aEuro degrees to 14.3aEuro degrees for sulfur. These values were well-constrained by the four identified sources: plankton, benthic organic matter, macroalgae, and terrestrial detritus. Application of a concentration-corrected mixing model resulted in contributions of benthic production and detrital sources (averaged over the food web) to East Bay consumers of 41% and 33%, respectively, with the remainder made up of plankton and benthic macroalage. While benthic organic matter was an important organic matter source for consumers at both sites, we found that the influence of terrestrial detritus varied significantly throughout the bay. Terrestrial detritus contributed only 18% of average total organic matter in organisms inhabiting marine-influenced sites. Although terrestrial detritus did contribute to all consumers examined, most fish species in Apalachicola Bay reflect a greater reliance on autochthonous sources. Our results suggest that, while terrestrial detritus does appear to be a major contributor to commercially important shellfish species (most notably oysters and penaeid shrimp), it is not the major source fueling the diversity of secondary production in Apalachicola Bay. Thus, production in Apalachicola Bay is highly dependent on riverine influx in two ways: (1) economically important bivalves and crustaceans are being fueled by terrestrial organic matter supplied by river flooding and (2) secondary and above consumer fish species are supported by in situ production which, in turn, is reliant on nutrients supplied by the Apalachicola River. These findings are significant in light of decisions regarding water usage and river flow restrictions in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint drainage basin. The results of this study confirm that in situ estuarine organic matter is the dominant source supporting secondary production in this river-dominated estuary.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems represent a potential additional source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) that has been insufficiently quantified. Thus, to understand the mechanisms controlling greenhouse gas emissions in these ecosystems, this study investigated CH4 emissions from and the related microbial properties of mangrove soils. Soil and gas samples were collected from several plots at different distances from the seashore in Soc Trang and Ca Mau in Vietnam, and the Sundarbans in India. Soil samples were incubated under different conditions, i.e., anaerobic or aerobic, and the microbial properties of each soil sample with the addition of different amounts of seawater were analyzed. Relatively high CH4 fluxes and production were detected during the aerobic incubation of samples from the seashore plots in Soc Trang and Ca Mau. However, CH4 production was reduced under anaerobic conditions [soil electrical conductivity (EC): 179-289 mSm(-1), pH (H2O): 7.45-8.10] compared with aerobic conditions [water content: 38.9-109.2%, EC: 187-299 mSm(-1), pH (H2O): 6.86-7.72], but it increased with increasing sulfate concentration, soil EC and cellulase activity and lowering soil pH under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, mangrove soil with a relatively high level of total organic carbon (C) exhibited relatively high CH4 production when diluted 4-fold with seawater under anaerobic conditions [water content: 38.9-109.2%, EC: 533 mSm(-1), pH (H2O): 6.67]. Nearly all of the DNA bands excised from polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis contained identical sequences related to archaea from the class Halobacteria. The high potential of the seashore plot for CH4 emissions could be due to the enhancement of cellulase activity under the intermittent oxygen supply, which promotes polysaccharide depolymerization and subsequently increases anaerobic methanogenic activities during tidal flooding. This study also indicates that the major archaea responsible for CH4 production require a particular hydrospheric salt concentration and soil pH.

AB  - Sulfur has been proposed as a useful element to employ in addition to carbon and nitrogen in stable isotope studies of marine food webs, but variability in delta(34)S of primary producers may prevent food web resolution. delta(34)S values in green leaves of the seagrass, Zostera capricorni, showed considerable variability (12.7-17.6parts per thousand) in a survey in Moreton Bay, Australia. We demonstrated that delta(34)S values were correlated with sediment organic matter (OM) content and height of seagrass on the tidal gradient, but these relationships were opposite to those expected from work elsewhere. In our survey, delta(34)S values were relatively depleted at sites higher on the shore and with lower OM content. We did find the expected relationship of depleted delta(34)S values where sediment porewater sulfide concentrations were higher. Any influence of OM content on delta(34)S values would have been confounded in the survey by the relationship between height on shore and OM content itself. We separated the effects of height and OM content by creating the following treatments at one height on the shore: (1) OM added, (2) procedural control, and (3) untouched control. delta(34)S values of seagrass in OM added plots were significantly depleted (5.6parts per thousand) relative to procedural (10.1parts per thousand) and untouched (11.0parts per thousand) controls 8 weeks after the manipulation. This demonstrated that OM content on its own does have the expected effect on delta(34)S values of seagrass, so in the initial survey another factor, probably related to height on shore, must have overridden the influence of OM content. Seagrass roots are able to exude excess oxygen produced during photosynthesis, reoxidising sulfides in surrounding porewater. We demonstrated that the above and below-ground biomass of seagrass was higher low on the shore, and contend that higher seagrass productivity low on the shore results in greater reoxidation of sulfides and leads to more enriched delta(34)S values of seagrass.

AB  - P>Coastal ocean bacterioplankton control the flow of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial and oceanic sources into the marine food web, and regulate the release of inorganic carbon to atmospheric and offshore reservoirs. While the fate of the chemically complex coastal DOC reservoir has long been recognized as a critical feature of the global carbon budget, it has been problematic to identify both the compounds that serve as major conduits for carbon flux and the roles of individual bacterioplankton taxa in mediating that flux. Here we analyse random libraries of expressed genes from a coastal bacterial community to identify sequences representing DOC-transporting proteins. Predicted substrates of expressed transporter genes indicated that carboxylic acids, compatible solutes, polyamines and lipids may be key components of the biologically labile DOC pool in coastal waters, in addition to canonical bacterial substrates such as amino acids, oligopeptides and carbohydrates. Half of the expressed DOC transporter sequences in this coastal ocean appeared to originate from just eight taxa: Roseobacter, SAR11, Flavobacteriales and five orders of gamma-Proteobacteria. While all major taxa expressed transporter genes for some DOC components (e.g. amino acids), there were indications of specialization within the bacterioplankton community for others (e.g. carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and polyamines). Experimental manipulations of the natural DOC pool that increased the concentration of phytoplankton- or vascular plant-derived compounds invoked a readily measured response in bacterial transporter gene expression. This highly resolved view of the potential for carbon flux into heterotrophic bacterioplankton cells identifies possible bioreactive components of the coastal DOC pool and highlights differing ecological roles in carbon turnover for the resident bacterial taxa.

AB  - Storing metal-rich mine waste (tailings) under submerged and reduced conditions can prevent the release of metals to the water column, but introduction of wetland plants on these sediments may alter the reducing environment through root oxygen diffusion or organic matter accumulation. Fertilization of these wetlands can enhance plant growth, but also may either strengthen reducing conditions via microbial stimulation, or increase the redox potential (Eh) through increased root radial oxygen loss. This long-term study (2.25 years) investigated the porewater As, Fe, and Zn concentrations of waterlogged Pb-Zn tailings from two Irish mines, Silvermines and Tara mines, with addition of Typha latifolia, fertilizer, or both treatments combined. In both tailings types, the fertilized plants showed significantly increased total biomass production, but the plants grew greater biomass in Tara tailings relative to Silvermines tailings even without fertilization. In Tara mines tailings, the addition of plants increased Eh and mobilized Zn; the addition of fertilizer enhanced reducing conditions and increased porewater concentrations of As and soluble sulfides; and the combination of treatments on these tailings resulted in complex interactions. In Silvermines tailings, there were negligible effects of the treatments. For effective sequestration of metals in these tailings, Silvermines would require only water cover, but Tara mines tailings would require either both treatments or neither because each treatment individually would increase solubility of As or Zn. These results show also the necessity of evaluating treatment effects specific to individual tailings, that long-term studies (years) are crucial for tailings equilibration and valid experimental conclusions, and that passive accumulation of organic matter may take decades.

AB  - Tussock formation is a global phenomenon that enhances microtopography and increases biodiversity by adding structure to ecological communities, but little is known about tussock development in relation to environmental factors. To further efforts to restore wetland microtopography and associated functions, we investigated Carex stricta tussock size in relation to elevation (a proxy for water depth) at a range of sites in southern Wisconsin, USA, and tested the effect of five hydroperiods and N + P addition (15 g N/m(2) +0.37 g P/m(2)) on tussock formation during a three-year mesocosm experiment. Wet meadows dominated by C. stricta averaged 4.9 tussocks/m(2), with a mean volume of 1160 cm(3) and height of 15 cm. Within sites, taller tussocks occurred at lower elevations, suggesting a structural adaptation to anoxic conditions. In our mesocosm experiment, C. stricta accelerated tussock formation when inundated, and it increased overall productivity with N + P addition. Within two growing seasons, continuous inundation (+18 cm) in the mesocosms led to tussocks that were nearly as tall as in our field survey (mean height in mesocosms, 10 +/- 1.3 cm; maximum, 17 cm). Plants grown with constant low water (-18 cm) only formed short mounds (mean height = 2 +/- 0.4 cm). After three growing seasons, the volume of the largest tussocks (3274 +/- 376 cm 3, grown with +18 cm water depth and N + P addition) was 12 times that of the smallest (275 +/- 38 cm(3), grown with -18 cm water depth and no N + P). Though tussock composition varied among hydroperiods, tussocks were predominantly organic (74-94% of dry mass) and composed of leaf bases (46-59%), fine roots (10-31%), and duff (5-13%). Only the plants subjected to high water levels produced the vertically oriented rhizomes and ascending shoot bases that were prevalent in field-collected tussocks. Under continuous or periodic inundation, tussocks achieved similar heights and accumulated similar levels of organic matter (range: 163-394 g C/m(2)), and we conclude that these hydroperiods can accelerate tussock formation. Thus, C. stricta has high utility for restoring wetland microtopography and associated functions, including carbon accumulation.

AB  - Macroalgal and seagrass communities are widely distributed in marine and brackish shallow water and have high productivity. The primary production in marine costal areas is often transported to intertidal flats by waves and currents and beached on the flats. Thus, we hypothesized that the macroalgae and seagrasses are food sources for benthic communities on intertidal flats where some gastropod species often dominate. We performed comparisons of food sources among different gastropod species on sub-tropical and temperate tidal flats (26 degrees and 38 degrees N, respectively), and used isotope mixing models using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. A mixing model for stable isotopes, IsoSource, revealed that main food sources for three snails were macroalgae (50-56%) and seagrass (39-45%) at the temperate site. The contributions of terrestrial plants, sediment organic matter and benthic microalgae were weaker than those of macroalgae and seagrasses. At the sub-tropical site, snails fed mainly on macroalgae. The differences in food sources between snail species were not remarkable, although the nitrogen values were slightly different. It would thus appear that macroalgae and seagrass play an important role in the food webs not only in their own habitats but also on the adjacent tidal flats.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixation (acetylene reduction) rates were measured over an annual cycle in meadows of the seagrass Zostera noltii Hornem in the Bassin d'Arcachon, south-west France, between March 1994 and February 1995, using both slurry and whole-core techniques. Measured rates using the slurry technique consistently overestimated those determined on whole cores, probably due to the release of labile organic carbon sources as a result of root damage during preparation of the slurries, Thus, the whole-core technique may provide a more accurate estimate of in situ activity, since disturbance of physicochemical gradients of oxygen, sulphide, nutrients and the relationship between the plant roots and the rhizosphere microflora is minimised. Rates measured by the whole-core method were 1.8- to 4-fold greater (dependent upon season) in the light than those measured during dark incubations, indicating that organic carbon diffusing from the plant roots during photosynthesis was an important factor in regulating nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere. Additions of sodium molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhibited acetylene-reduction activity by > 80% as measured by both the slurry and whole-core techniques throughout the year, inferring that SRB were the dominant component of the nitrogen-fixing microflora. A mutualistic relationship between Z. noltii and nitrogen-fixing SRB in the rhizosphere, based on the exchange of organic carbon and fixed nitrogen is proposed. Acetylene- and sulphate-reduction rates showed distinct summer peaks which correlated with a reduced availability of ammonium in the sediment and the annual growth cycle of Z. noltii in the basin. Overall, these data indicate that acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) activity in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii was regulated both by the availability of organic carbon from the plant roots and maintenance of a low NH4+ concentration in the vicinity of the plant roots due to efficient assimilation of NH4+ by Z. noltii during the growth season. Nitrogen-fixation rates determined from acetylene-reduction rates measured using the whole-core technique ranged from 0.1 to 7.3 mg N m(-2) d(-1), depending on season, and were calculated to contribute between 0.4 and 1.1 g N m(-2) yr(-1), or 6.3 to 12% of the annual fixed nitrogen requirement of Z. noltii.

AB  - Decomposition and leaching of brown leaves of eelgrass (Zostera marina) was followed with or without a community of indigenous bacteria. The leaves lost 9% of their ash free dry mass (AFDM) via leaching during 30 days. At this time bacterial production supported by the leaves was distributed with 61% in the water and 39% on the leaves. A carbon budget indicated that bacteria consumed 28% of the leached dissolved organic carbon. This consumed carbon was mostly (71%) respired and 29% of it was allocated into the bacterial biomass. Eight percent of the leached organic carbon and 0.8% of the initial carbon content of the leaves entered into the bacterial biomass. The results can be used to estimate transfer of carbon from detrital eelgrass leaves to bacteria. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The island Spiekeroog (Germany) at the southern North Sea coast exhibits an island tail (Ostplate) of which large parts formed after 1860 by gradual eastward deposition of marine sediments. This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island's gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen (TN), and mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. pH = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (delta S-34) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The delta C-13 signatures of organic matter (OM) decreased and TOC/TN -and TOC/total sulfur (TS) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, delta N-15 resembled the dominant input of OM from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.

AB  - We analyzed energy partitioning in short- and long-hydroperiod freshwater marsh ecosystems in the Florida Everglades by examining energy balance components (eddy covariance derived latent energy (LE) and sensible heat (H) flux). The study period included several wet and dry seasons and variable water levels, allowing us to gain better mechanistic information about the control of and changes in marsh hydroperiods. The annual length of inundation is similar to 5 months at the short-hydroperiod site (25 degrees 2616.5N, 80 degrees 3540.68W), whereas the long-hydroperiod site (25 degrees 336.72N, 80 degrees 4657.36W) is inundated for similar to 12 months annually due to differences in elevation and exposure to surface flow. In the Everglades, surface fluxes feed back to wet season precipitation and affect the magnitude of seasonal change in water levels through water loss as LE (evapotranspiration (ET)). At both sites, annual precipitation was higher than ET (1304 versus 1008 at the short-hydroperiod site and 1207 versus 1115 mm yr(-1) at the long-hydroperiod site), though there were seasonal differences in the ratio of ET:precipitation. Results also show that energy balance closure was within the range found at other wetland sites (60 to 80%) and was lower when sites were inundated (60 to 70%). Patterns in energy partitioning covaried with hydroperiods and climate, suggesting that shifts in any of these components could disrupt current water and biogeochemical cycles throughout the Everglades region. These results suggest that the complex relationships between hydroperiods, energy exchange, and climate are important for creating conditions sufficient to maintain Everglades ecosystems.

AB  - Dam removal can restore fish passage, natural flow regimes, sediment transport in streams, dispersal of organic matter, and drift of aquatic insects. However, dam removal also impacts the riparian vegetation, with both immediate and delayed responses. In this study, we measure vegetation change at the Merrimack Village Dam site on the Souhegan River in Merrimack, NH, USA. The August 2008 removal caused a similar to 3-m drop in water level and rapid erosion of impounded sediment, with similar to 50% removed in the first 3months. Terrace, floodplain, and wetland communities were surveyed in summer 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2015. Temporal change was quantified using Analysis of Similarity on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. Only herbaceous vegetation closest to the river channel and in the off-channel wetland changed significantly. The herbaceous plots directly adjacent to the impoundment eroded to bare sand in 2009, but by 2014, the original riparian fringe community had re-established in the newly developed floodplain. Between 2007 and 2014, the off-channel wetland area changed from aquatic species to a stable terrestrial community that persisted without significant change in 2015. The vegetation response was greatest in areas with the largest geomorphic and hydrologic change. These included the channel margin where erosion and bank slumping created an unstable scarp. The mid-channel island and off-channel wetland were strongly affected by the lowered water table. However, large unvegetated areas never persisted nor did the areal coverage of invasive species expand, which are two frequent concerns of dam removal stakeholders.

AB  - Salinity and organic matter loading gradients in estuaries can be used to examine iron sulfide mineral formation. Chesapeake Bay has low salinity, terrestrially-dominated sediments in the northern bay, seasonally anoxic mesohaline environments in the mid-bay region, and coarser-grained, bioturbated sediments in the more saline southern bay. High rates of sediment sulfur reoxidation and low inputs of labile organic matter limit the burial of authigenic sulfide minerals in northern bay sediments, while the activity of bioturbating organisms in south bay sediments enhances the reoxidation of sulfur. High iron sulfide delta(34)S values in the northern bay are consistent with low sulfate concentrations. A strong bay-wide relationship between organic carbon and iron sulfide concentrations was evident when refractory terrestrial organic matter was considered.

AB  - We tested the hypothesis that dissolved silicate (DSi) yields [kg km(-2) yr(-1)] of 82 major watersheds of the Baltic Sea can be expressed as a function of the hydraulic load (HL) as a measure of water residence time and the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, both variables potentially increasing the DSi yield. Most boreal rivers fitted a linear regression model using HL as an independent variable to explain the DSi yield. Rivers with high HL, i.e., shortest residence times, showed highest DSi yields up to 2300 kg km(-2) yr(-1). This is most likely caused by an excess supply of DSi, i.e., the geochemical sources prevail over biological sinks in these boreal watersheds. The DSi yield for regulated and unregulated larger rivers of the boreal watersheds constituting about 40% of the total water discharge and of the total DSi load to the Baltic Sea, respectively, can be expressed as: DSi yield = 190 + 49.5 HL[m yr(-1)] + 0.346 TOC [mu M] (R-2=0.80). Since both HL and TOC concentrations have decreased after damming, the DSi yields have decreased significantly in the regulated boreal watersheds, for the River Lulealven we estimated more than 30%. The larger eutrophic watersheds draining cultivated landscape of the southern catchment of the Baltic Sea and representing about 50% of the annual water discharge to the Baltic Sea, deviated from this pattern and showed lower DSi yields between 60-580 kg km(-2) yr(-1). DSi yields showed saturation curve like relationship to HL and it appeals that DSi is retained in the watersheds efficiently through biogenic silica (BSi) production and subsequent sedimentation along the entire river network. The relationship between HL and DSi yields for all larger cultivated watersheds was best fitted by a Freundlich isotherm (DSi= 115.7HL(109); R-2=0.73), because once lake and reservoir area exceeds 10% of the watershed area, minimum DSi yields were reached. To estimate an uperturbed DSi yield for the larger eutrophic southeastern watersheds is still difficult, since no unperturbed watersheds for comparison were available. However, a rough estimate indicate that the DSi flux from the cultivated watersheds to the Baltic Sea is nowadays only half the uperturbed flux. Overall, the riverine DSi loads to the Baltic Sea might have dropped with 30-40% during the last century. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports findings about the growth of Spartina alterniflora (Loisel.) near an engineered coastal protection defences to discover the potential influences on vegetation growth from the artificial topography. Impacts of the artificial topography on the sediment element composition were detected by comparing the fixed effects caused by artificial topography and wave exposure using linear mixed models. Surficial sediments under the impacts of artificial topography contain elevated levels of biogenic elements and heavy metals, including C (and organic carbon), N, S, Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb. The results showed that element enrichment caused by artificial topography reduced the vegetation sexual reproduction. Contrary to the potential inhibition caused by direct wave exposure, which was due to the biomass accumulation limit, the inhibition caused by artificial topography was related to the transition of growth strategy. The contents of Cu, Mn, N, Ni, S and As in the sediments were critical in considering the relationship between the change in the sediment element composition and the alteration in the plant growth. Our study emphasizes the importance of rethinking the impacts of coastal development projects, especially regarding the heterogeneity of sediment element composition and its ecological consequences.

AB  - The rates of crude oil degradation by the extant microorganisms in intertidal sediments from a northern Gulf of Mexico beach were determined. The enhancement in crude oil degradation by amending the microbial communities with marine organic matter was also examined. Replicate mesocosm treatments consisted of: (i) controls (intertidal sand), (ii) sand contaminated with crude oil, (iii) sand plus organic matter, and (iv) sand plus crude oil and organic matter. Carbon dioxide (CO2) production was measured daily for 42 days and the carbon isotopic ratio of CO2 (delta(CO2)-C-13) was used to determine the fraction of CO2 derived from microbial respiration of crude oil. Bacterial 16S rRNA clone library analyses indicated members of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi occurred exclusively in control sediments whereas Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes occurred in both control and oil contaminated sediments. Members of the hydrocarbon-degrading genera Hydrocarboniphaga, Pseudomonas, and Pseudoxanthomonas were found primarily in oil contaminated treatments. Hydrocarbon mineralization was 76% higher in the crude oil amended with organic matter treatment compared to the rate in the crude oil only treatment indicating that biodegradation of crude oil in the intertidal zone by an extant microbial community is enhanced by input of organic matter.

AB  - The composition and accumulation of BSi and its role in C sequestration in the YRDW were quantified based on field investigation combined with remote sensing observation in the Yellow River Delta Wetland (YRDW). Results show that the soil BSi pool in the YRDW mainly consists of phytoliths. The pools of BSi, TOC, and BSi-occluded C (OCBSi) for aboveground plants in the YRDW are 7.6 g m(-2), 129 g m(-2) and 0.13 g m(-2), respectively. Surface soil (0-10 cm) stocks of BSi, TOC, and OCBSi are 1780 g m(-2), 840 g m(-2) and 40 g m(-2). Our results showed that BSi preservation efficiencies of BSi (52%) and (OCBSi) (51%) in deep soil layers exceed those of TOC (35%) based on the vertical variation of BSi in the sediment. Approximately 333 t of C fixed by plants is occluded in the phytoliths as OCBSi in the YRDW. Almost half of this OCBSi is preserved in the sediment in stable form. The YRDW is therefore an important sink for BSi and BSi-occluded C.

AB  - Microbial communities in intertidal coastal soils respond to a variety of environmental factors related to resources availability, habitat characteristics, and vegetation. These intertidal soils of India are dominated with Salicornia brachiata, Aeluropus lagopoides, and Suaeda maritima halophytes, which play a significant role in carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and improving microenvironment. However, the relative contribution of edaphic factors, halophytes, rhizosphere, and bulk sediments on microbial community composition is poorly understood in the intertidal sediments. Here, we sampled rhizosphere and bulk sediments of three dominant halophytes (Salicornia, Aeluropus, and Suaeda) from five geographical locations of intertidal region of Gujarat, India. Sediment microbial community structure was characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Microbial biomass was significantly influenced by the pH, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, and sodium and potassium concentrations. Multivariate analysis of PLFA profiles had significantly separated the sediment microbial community composition of regional sampling sites, halophytes, rhizosphere, and bulk sediments. Sediments from Suaeda plants were characterized by higher abundance of PLFA biomarkers of Gram-negative, total bacteria, and actinomycetes than other halophytes. Significantly highest abundance of Gram-positive and fungal PLFAs was observed in sediments of Aeluropus and Salicornia, respectively than in those of Suaeda. The rhizospheric sediment had significantly higher abundance of Gram-negative and fungal PLFAs biomarkers compared to bulk sediment. The results of the present study contribute to our understanding of the relative importance of different edaphic and spatial factors and halophyte vegetation on sediment microbial community of intertidal sediments of coastal ecosystem.

AB  - We investigated the influence of inter-annual and seasonal differences on the distribution of live and dead foraminifera, and the inter-annual variability of stable carbon isotopes (PC), total organic carbon (TOC) values and carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios in bulk sediments from intertidal environments of Bandon Marsh (Oregon, USA). Living and dead foraminiferal species from 10 stations were analyzed over two successive years in the summer (dry) and fall (wet) seasons. There were insignificant inter-annual and seasonal variations in the distribution of live and dead species. But there was a noticeable decrease in calcareous assemblages (Haynesina sp.) between live populations and dead assemblages, indicating that most of the calcareous tests were dissolved after burial; the agglutinated assemblages were comparable between constituents. The live populations and dead assemblages were dominated by Miliammina fusca in the tidal flat and low marsh, Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata and M. fusca in the high marsh, and Trochamminita irregularis and Balticammina pseudomacrescens in the highest marsh to upland. Geochemical analyses (VC, TOC and C/N of bulk sedimentary organic matter) show no significant influence of inter-annual variations but a significant correlation of PC values (R = -0.820, p < 0.001), TOC values (R = 0.849, p < 0.001) and C/N ratios (R = 0.885, p < 0.001) to elevation with respect to the tidal frame. Our results suggest that foraminiferal assemblages and delta C-13 and TOC values, as well as C/N ratios, in Bandon Marsh are useful in reconstructing paleo sea-levels on the North American Pacific coast.

AB  - Burrow characteristics, food type, and feeding habits of the SW Atlantic burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulata were compared between individuals living in mud flats and in Spartina-dominated marshes. Burrows were shorter (x = 19.7 cm, SD = 5.8, n = 54) and more dynamic (entrance displacement: x = 3.2 cm d(-1), SD = 1.7, n = 21) in mud flats than in Spartina-dominated areas (length: x = 41 cm, SD = 12, n = 78; no entrance displacement). Sediment turnover rate was much higher in mud flats (x = 5.9 kg m(-2) d(-1)) than in Spartina-dominated areas (x = 2.4 kg m(-2) d(-1)). Burrow shape differed between areas, being straight, near-vertical tunnels in the vegetated area, but oblique (average angle to vertical = 60 degrees, SD = 16 degrees, n = 110), and having a funnel-shape entrance and a much larger diameter in mud flats. Stomach contents also differed between habitats. Pieces of plants dominated contents in the vegetated area, while sediment (with polychaetes, diatoms, ostracods, and nematodes) dominated in the mud flats, indicating that crabs are mainly deposit feeders in the mud flats and herbivorous in the Spartina-dominated areas. This pattern suggests that the heuristic model relating burrow architecture to trophic modes previously proposed for fossorial thalassinidean shrimps applies to individuals of a C. granulata population. The burrow content showed higher organic content and vegetal parts in the vegetated area than in the other area. Burrows in the mud flat showed a significantly higher abundance of nematodes and ostracods. Due to their hydrodynamic characteristics and content, burrows in the mud flats may work as passive traps for sediment and organic matter. Given the extensive intertidal area inhabited by C. granulata in SW Atlantic estuaries, and the location of their burrows (between marshes and the open estuary), these burrows may work as traps for detritus, thus reducing the export rate of organic matter from marshes.

AB  - Hypersaline environments are among the most vulnerable coastal ecosystems and are extremely noteworthy for a variety of ecological reasons. Comprehensive assessment of metal(oid) contamination in hypersaline sediments from Secovlje (Northern Adriatic, Slovenia) was addressed by introducing the detrital and diagenetic mineralogy and geochemical properties within the solid sediment material. Close associations between Fe/Mn oxides and oxyhydroxides with As, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, and between organic matter with Cu, Pb and Zn were confirmed using X-ray powder diffraction, SEM-EDS and ICP emission spectrometry analysis. Possible incorporation or adsorption on the crystal lattices of clay minerals (As, Cr, Pb, Sn and Zn), halite (As) and aragonite/calcite (Cd, Cu, Pb, Sr and Zn) were also detected. All presented correlations were highlighted by various statistical analyses. The enrichment factor (EF) values showed a low degree of anthropogenic burden for As, Bi, Hg and Zn, while Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sn and Sr originated from the geological background. These results emphasise that a detailed mineralogical and geochemical characterisation of solid (especially detrital and diagenetic) sediment particles is crucial in further understanding the metal(oid) translocation within the hypersaline ecosystems.

AB  - In situ oxygen microprofiles, sediment organic carbon content, and pore-water concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, iron, manganese, and sulfides obtained in sediments from the Rhone River prodelta and its adjacent continental shelf were used to constrain a numerical diagenetic model. Results showed that (1) the organic matter from the Rhone River is composed of a fraction of fresh material associated to high first-order degradation rate constants (11-33 yr(-1)); (2) the burial efficiency (burial/input ratio) in the Rh boolean AND one prodelta (within 3 km of the river outlet) can be up to 80 %, and decreases to similar to 20% on the adjacent continental shelf 10-15 km further offshore; (3) there is a large contribution of anoxic processes to total mineralization in sediments near the river mouth, certainly due to large inputs of fresh organic material combined with high sedimentation rates; (4) diagenetic by-products originally produced during anoxic organic matter mineralization are almost entirely precipitated (> 97 %) and buried in the sediment, which leads to (5) a low contribution of the re-oxidation of reduced products to total oxygen consumption. Consequently, total carbon mineralization rates as based on oxygen consumption rates and using Redfield stoichiometry can be largely underestimated in such River-dominated Ocean Margins (RiOMar) environments.

AB  - The use of multiple stable isotopes in the study of trophic relationships in temperate estuaries has usually been limited to euhaline systems, in which phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, and Spartina alterniflora are major sources of organic matter for consumers. Within large estuaries such as Chesapeake Bay, however, many species of consumers are found in the upper mesohaline to oligohaline portions. These lower salinity wetlands have a greater abundance of macrophytes that use C3 photosynthesis to fix carbon, in addition to S. alterniflora, which fixes carbon via the C4 photosynthetic pathway. In a broad survey of the biota and sediments of a brackish tidal creek tributary to Chesapeake Bay, combined delta(13)C and delta(34)S measurements disclosed a balanced contribution to secondary production from phytoplankton, C3 macrophytes, Spartina sp., and benthic microalgae. Surface sediment delta(13)C suggested that the organic matter from C3 plants was derived both from allochthonous sources (terrestrial runoff) and from autochthonous production (marsh macrophytes). Unlike most estuarine systems studied to date, which are dominated by algae (phytoplankton and benthic microalgae) and C4 macrophytes, C3 plants are of greater importance in the diets of consumers in this low-salinity creek system.

AB  - Export of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from an island mangrove swamp was traced and quantified by analysis of dissolved lignin-derived humic substances and naturally fluorescing compounds. Concentrations of both lignin phenols and fluorescent compounds indicated the tidally-mediated movement of DOM offshore from the swamp to distances at least 1 km seaward. Laboratory studies documented the formation of significant amounts of DOM from degrading mangrove leaves, about 20% of which was highly-fluorescent humic substances. At the 1 km station, vascular plant-derived material was calculated to account for about 10% of the total DOM, based on simple mixing models. A correlation between apparent concentrations of vascular plant-derived DOM and rates of bacterial secondary production suggests that some components of exported DOM are available for bacterioplankton growth in offshore environments.

AB  - Study of the flux and fate of reactive organic material (OM) within Debidue Flat, an intertidal sandflat in the North Inlet estuary. South Carolina. demonstrated that this coarse-grained deposit is a dynamic, open system that experiences rapid OM decomposition and exchange Of Solutes in the top 30 cut of the sediment column. The fluxes of reactive OM through Debidue Flat were high during all seasons (27-170 mmol C m(2) d(-1)) and were comparable to fluxes in muddy portions of the North Inlet estuary. Porewater decomposition products were N- and P-rich. the modeled reactivity of organic carbon undergoing decomposition was high (first-order rate constant. k = 0.02 d(-1)), and abundant extractable chlorophyll a was measured year-round; all properties were consistent with marine algal-derived Substrates. Porewater Solute profiles were controlled by advective flow that rapidly exchanged porewater with overlying waters to similar to25 cm depth on timescales of hours. Thus, these sandflats act like all unsteady "trickling bed filter." capturing or generating reactive organic particles, rapidly remineralizing OM. and recycling nutrients. Macrobiological structures within the flat altered the amounts and reaction rates of OM on various spatial and temporal scales. Relatively elevated OM decay rates were associated with the burrows of Callichirus major, a deep-burrowing thalassinid shrimp. Large stingray feeding pits accumulated fine grained OM, locally clogging the "trickling bed filter," and inhibiting porewater advection. As illustrated by Debidue Flat. intertidal sands call be sites of high OM flux and turnover and play an important role in biogeochemical cycling in estuarine systems.

AB  - The sulfur stable isotopic composition of Spartina alterniflora in a low salinity tidal creek system was related to differences in porewater sulfur chemistry determined by salinity, hydrodynamics, and season. The extent of porewater sulfide accumulation, the reoxidation of sulfide minerals, and sulfate limitation of sulfate reduction were important processes controlling the delta(34)S Of the sulfur available for plant uptake. The influence of sedimentary sulfate reduction rates on S. alterniflora delta(34)S was demonstrated in the comparison of 2 sites with similar sulfate supply but differing hydrology; plant delta(34)S values were heavier where sediments were more oxidized relative to plant delta(34)S values from a frequently flooded marsh with more reduced sediments The role of sulfate supply in determining S. alterniflora delta(34)S values was apparent in the comparison of 3 sites with similar hydrology but differing salinity; shoot delta(34)S decreased with increasing salinity. In low salinity marshes, oxidation of stored sulfide minerals in winter and spring led to Lighter shoot delta(34)S values, while sulfate depletion in late summer was associated with isotopically heavier shoot sulfur. Variability on spatial and temporal scales in sulfur stable isotopic composition of S, alterniflora has implications for the use of its delta(31)S values in studies of trophic dynamics in estuarine marshes. The sulfur chemistry of the marsh sediments and the sampling season may both influence the stable isotopic signature of this important primary producer.

AB  - Hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) are associated with natural organic matter (OM) in the environment via mechanisms such as sorption or chemical binding. The latter interactions are difficult to quantitatively constrain, as HOCs can reside in different OM pools outside of conventional analytical windows. Here, we exploited natural abundance variations in radiocarbon ((14)C) to trace various fossil fuel-derived HOCs ((14)C- free) within chemically defined fractions of contemporary OM (modern (14)C content) in 13 samples including marine and freshwater sediments and one dust and one soil sample. Samples were sequentially treated by solvent extraction followed by saponification. Radiocarbon analysis of the bulk sample and resulting residues was then performed. Fossil fuel-derived HOCs released by these treatments were quantified from an isotope mass balance approach as well as by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the majority of samples (n = 13), 98-100% of the total HOC pool was solvent extractable. Nonextracted HOCs are only significant (29% of total HOC pool) in one sample containing pp-2,2-bis(chlorophenyl)1,1,1-trichloroethane and its metabolites. The infrequency of significant incorporation of HOCs into nonextracted OM residues suggests that most HOCs are mobile and bioavailable in the environment and, as such, have a greater potential to exert adverse effects.

AB  - 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability.
   2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature.
   3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change.
   4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.

AB  - Prior to Hurricane Isaac making landfall along the Gulf of Mexico coast in August 2012, local and state officials were concerned that the hurricane would mobilize submerged oiled-materials from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill. In this study, we investigated materials washed ashore following the hurricane to determine if it affected the chemical composition or density of oil-containing sand patties regularly found on Gulf Coast beaches. While small changes in sand patty density were observed in samples collected before and after the hurricane, these variations appear to have been driven by differences in sampling location and not linked to the passing of Hurricane Isaac. Visual and chemical analysis of sand patties confirmed that the contents was consistent with oil from the Macondo well. Petroleum hydrocarbon signatures of samples collected before and after the hurricane showed no notable changes. In the days following Hurricane Isaac, dark-colored mats were also found on the beach in Fort Morgan, AL, and community reports speculated that these mats contained oil from the DWH spill. Chemical analysis of these mat samples identified n-alkanes but no other petroleum hydrocarbons. Bulk and delta C-13 organic carbon analyses indicated mat samples were comprised of marshland peat and not related to the DWH spill. This research indicates that Hurricane Isaac did not result in a notable change the composition of oil delivered to beaches at the investigated field sites. This study underscores the need for improved communications with interested stakeholders regarding how to differentiate oiled from non-oiled materials. This is especially important given the high cost of removing oiled debris and the increasing likelihood of false positives as oiled-materials washing ashore from a spill become less abundant over time.

AB  - We used stable isotope analysis to investigate the relative importance of marine and terrestrial sources of organic matter to the food web of 4 nearshore reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel (California, USA) over a 4 yr period that included substantial variability in the availability of marine and terrestrial organic matter. We measured stable C and N isotope values of ocean- and land-derived sources of organic matter and of different types of consumers on reefs that varied in exposure to freshwater runoff and in biomass of giant kelp. delta C-13 values of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) on reefs tended to decrease following periods of significant rainfall at the reef most influenced by freshwater runoff, to increase with phytoplankton standing crop at all reefs, and generally to decline in both wet and dry years in late fall-early winter at all reefs. Stable isotope values of reef consumers indicated little direct use of terrestrially-derived POM. However, a pattern of N-15-enrichment in 2 common benthic-feeding species, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the annelid Diopatra ornata, with increasing influence of runoff indicated that terrestrially-derived nitrogen may enter the food web indirectly through a trophic intermediate (e.g. microbes, algae). The importance of giant kelp to the reef food web varied with consumer feeding mode. In contrast to previous studies, delta C-13 values suggested little use of kelp-derived material by suspension-feeders, based on the similarity in isotope values of these consumers among reefs when kelp biomass was low, and the absence of a directional shift in isotope values that would indicate the use of more C-13-enriched kelp when kelp biomass was higher at 2 of the reefs. However, isotope values for herbivores were generally C-13-enriched relative to suspension-feeders, reflecting the use of local giant kelp or other C-13-enriched benthic algal production. Thus, spatial and temporal fluctuations in the biomass of giant kelp would be least likely to impact the food resources of suspension-feeders and have greatest effect on benthic herbivores.

AB  - There is a strong need to understand sources of organic matter in coastal lagoons because these systems often have long water residence times, are susceptible to eutrophication, and display symptoms such as low-oxygen conditions. We found that integrated dissolved oxygen (DO) consumption in the water column accounted for 67-73% of total DO consumption in two eutrophic coastal lagoons (Baffin Bay and Oso Bay) in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. The delta C-13 of particulate organic carbon (delta C-13(POC)) showed temporal variations that corresponded with hydrological condition changes in Baffin Bay but fewer temporal changes in Oso Bay, whereas the lower delta N-15(PON) values in Baffin Bay indicated more agricultural influence than in Oso Bay, where urban sewage influences dominated. Based on closed-system incubation experiments, water-column respiration in Baffin Bay was driven by the respiration of a combination of phytoplankton, carbon from near-shore and benthic macrophytes, and other allochthonous organic carbon sources depending on hydrological conditions. However, respiration of algal carbon dominated DO consumption in Baffin Bay sediments. In comparison, Oso Bay water-column respiration was largely attributed to the degradation of phytoplankton, the growth of which was sustained by nutrient discharge from wastewater treatment plants in the watershed. In contrast to the water column, seagrass and saltmarsh carbon appeared to be the primary organic carbon source that drove DO consumption in Oso Bay sediments. These observations highlight the complexity of organic carbon sources that contribute to DO consumption in estuaries affected by human activities, especially in systems with long water residence times that can retain both organic matter and nutrients for extended periods of time.

AB  - Forty four core samples were analyzed to determine sediment particle size, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total nitrogen and total sulphur. Sequential extraction of S was also carried out, differentiating AVS (acid volatile sulphide), elemental S, organic S and pyrite S. The results obtained show that the presence of mussel rafts causes intense changes in the physicochemical composition and properties of the sea floor in the Ria de Arousa. The percentage of silt and clay, TOC, TIC and total N were significantly higher in the biodeposit than in the sediment. In contrast, there were no differences between the biodeposit and the sediment in terms of pH (8.0-8.7.) and redox potential. The sediment and biodeposit were always anoxic, with values of redox potentials below -100 mV. In accordance with these conditions, the dominant fraction of S was Pyrite S (FeS2). The AVS fraction and elemental S were present at low concentrations, except in the Uppermost part of each core. Pyrite was relatively stable when the biodeposit and sediment were maintained in suspension for 8 days in oxic sea water; Unlike the AVS fraction, which disappeared within a few hours.

AB  - Mangroves, along with seagrasses and saltmarshes, are among the coastal ecosystems known as blue carbon ecosystems. These ecosystems are natural carbon sinks, relevant to mitigate global warming because they are able to sequester significant amounts of CO2 for biomass production, and to store organic matter in sediments for a very long time. We present the temporal evaluation of fluxes (g m(-2) year(-1)) and inventories (Mg ha(-1)) of organic carbon (C-org) from sediment cores collected in mangroves areas associated with the coastal lagoon Estero de Urias, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa. The work strategy included the geochemical characterization of sediments by elemental composition analysis through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry to evaluate changes in sediment origin (terrestrial or marine); the determination of the grain size distribution to evaluate changes in the hydrodynamics of the study sites; and the quantification of C-org concentrations with an elemental analyzer. Finally, we estimated the economic cost of the impacts of CO2 emissions caused by the oxidation of C-org due to potential perturbations of the study sites. This information is an additional component of the economic benefits of the preservation of mangrove ecosystems, relevant in coastal wetland management plans, since mangrove conservation contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and could be used as part of an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change strategy in tropical and subtropical zones around the world.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the SOM (soil organic matter) by Py-GC/MS, and humic acids (HA) by chemical and spectroscopic techniques such as elemental analysis, EPR and FTIR, extracted from a Brazilian mangrove ecosystem soil under different types of vegetation, Spartina alterniflora (SSp), Laguncularia racemosa (SLg), Avicennia schauerianna (SAv) and Rhizophora mangle (SRz) Inputs of woody and non-woody vegetation were distinguished in the SOM, as well as a greater decomposition of the SOM extracted from soils under SSp and SLg was identified However, elemental and spectroscopic techniques revealed only slightly higher N, H, S contents, a slightly higher H/C atomic ratio and a lower SFR content in the HA of the mangrove soils studied than the found in the HA extracted of upland soils A slight depth-related increase in SFR content was also observed in the HA, which may be a result of the fresh and labile plant-derived organic matter input into the soil surface layers Chemical and spectroscopic techiniques were useful tools in characterizing the SOM and HA extracted from the mangrove soil studied, however, more profiles must be studied to improve interpretation of the chemical variations and dynamics of the SOM/HS in this type of environment

AB  - Distichlis littoralis (Engelm.) H.L. Bell & Columbus = Monanthochloe littoralis Engelm. is a New World temperate- and subtropical-zone perennial grass that is an important species in hypersaline coastal landscapes. Also known as shoregrass, it tolerates salinities twice that of seawater. It occurs in soils low in organic matter and deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Dense, monotypic populations of D. littoralis eliminate nearly all competing annuals in harsh coastal habitats. Distichlis littoralis provides limited cover and limited nutrition for resident and migratory birds.

AB  - Dynamics of sulfur forms in the surface soils were investigated in the seasonal flooding wetlands (SEW), short-term flooding wetlands (SHW) and tidal flooding wetlands (TFW) affected by the flow-sediment regulation event in the Yellow River Delta from April to October of 2012. Our results demonstrated that the changing trend of inorganic sulfur (IS) and total sulfur (TS) contents were consistent. TS and IS contents in SEW and SHW soils showed a decrease and then an increase in the whole sampling dates. TS and IS showed significant differences between the TFW and SEW soils (p < 0.05). Water-soluble sulfate (H2O-S) contents exhibited a "decreasing then increasing" trend after the regulation (from July to October) in the SHW (7.86-19.23 mg/kg) and SEW (8.12-16.27 mg/kg) soils, whereas the TFW (21.35-30.58 mg/kg) soils showed an opposite trend after the regulation. The dynamic variations in absorbed sulfate (Absorbed-S) in the SHW (1.52-2.64 mg/kg), SEW (1.27-1.93 mg/kg) and TFW (2.06-2.89 mg/kg) soils before and after the regulation were consistent with H2O-S. Hydrochloric acid-soluble sulfur (HCl-S) contents in the SEW (4.13-6.72 mg/kg) soils showed a "double V" tendency before and after the regulation. In the SHW (4.51-7.26 mg/kg) soils, HCl-S contents showed an increasing trend before the regulation and a "decreasing then increasing" trend after the regulation. Sulfide sulfur (Sulfide-S) contents increased significantly after the regulation in SHW, SEW and TFW soils. Compared to the SHWsoils, C-O-S showed a similar dynamic trend in the SEW and TFW soils. Dynamic variations in CeS contents in SHW, SEW and TFW soils were similar to that of TS. On the whole, the average contents of TS, IS and OS in the three flooding wetlands followed the order: TFW > SHW > SEW during the sampling period. Sulfur forms in the three wetlands followed the order: C-S > C-O-S > H2O-S > HCl-S > Absorbed-S > SulfideS. Compared with C-O-S, C-S was significantly correlated with TN and clay, explaining the prevalence of C-S over C-O-S in wetland soils in the Yellow River Delta. The distribution of sulfur forms were significantly influenced by soil texture, organic matter, pH values, soil water and salinity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An ecomorphodynamic model was developed to study how Avicennia marina mangroves influence channel network evolution in sandy tidal embayments. The model accounts for the effects of mangrove trees on tidal flow patterns and sediment dynamics. Mangrove growth is in turn controlled by hydrodynamic conditions. The presence of mangroves was found to enhance the initiation and branching of tidal channels, partly because the extra flow resistance in mangrove forests favours flow concentration, and thus sediment erosion in between vegetated areas. The enhanced branching of channels is also the result of a vegetation-induced increase in erosion threshold. On the other hand, this reduction in bed erodibility, together with the soil expansion driven by organic matter production, reduces the landward expansion of channels. The ongoing accretion in mangrove forests ultimately drives a reduction in tidal prism and an overall retreat of the channel network. During sea-level rise, mangroves can potentially enhance the ability of the soil surface to maintain an elevation within the upper portion of the intertidal zone, while hindering both the branching and headward erosion of the landward expanding channels. The modelling results presented here indicate the critical control exerted by ecogeomorphological interactions in driving landscape evolution.

AB  - Following decades of habitat loss, carbon sequestration by coastal margin habitats has been recognised for its capacity to regulate atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Chichester Harbour, an estuarine complex on the South coast of the UK, is used as a case study area in this paper. Saltmarsh habitat there has declined by 60.6% from 1946 to 2018. This downward trend is predicted to continue. Extrapolated from historic habitat loss, three future saltmarsh habitat area scenarios (worst-case, average loss, best-case) are used to estimate the net carbon sequestered by saltmarsh from 2018 to 2030. Only the best-case scenario predicts a positive net carbon sequestration. Two representative carbon prices (UK policy abatement cost, and the social cost of carbon) are applied to estimate the value of the net carbon sequestered. Discount rates of 2.3% and 3.5% are also applied. Average loss scenario values range from -2,221,358.99 pound +/- 627,655.96 (abatement cost and a 2.3% discount rate) to -986,303.19 pound +/- 278,684.84 (social cost of carbon and a 3.5% discount rate). This study is the first to examine non-use values in the area. Results generated here can aid in highlighting the benefits saltmarsh habitats provide, promoting its conservation, as valuations of coastal habitats are poorly represented in management.

AB  - Sea-level rise is anticipated to alter hydrologic and salinity regimes of coastal wetlands. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to determine species-level responses to 12 sea-level rise scenarios. Both hydrologic regime (-10, +5, and +20 cm flooding depth) and salinity level (fresh, 2%o, 4%o, and 6%o) were interactively manipulated. Within these various sea-level rise scenarios, we sought to determine the effects of hydrologic regime, salinity level, and the interaction of these two stresses on the productivity of Panicum hemitomon, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Spartina patens, which are dominant macrophytes of fresh, intermediate, and brackish marsh types, respectively, in coastal Louisiana and the southeastern coastal plain. We found that altered hydrologic regimes and increased salinity levels differentially affected edaphic conditions and species-level productivity. Increases in flooding depth were most detrimental to S. patens. Salinity levels greater than 4%o resulted in mortality of P. hemitomon, and salinity levels of 6%o resulted in reduced growth and eventual death of S. lancifolia. The effects of elevated salinity levels on P. hemitomon and S. lancifolia were exacerbated when coupled with increased flooding levels. Although soil organic matter was shown to increase in all vegetative conditions, increases were dependent upon the productivity of the species under the different hydrologic regimes and salinity levels with P. hemitomon displaying tremendous potential to increase soil organic matter under fresh conditions, especially when coupled with moderate flooding. The results of this study indicate that as plant communities are subjected to long-term changes in hydrology and salinity levels, community productivity and sustainability ultimately will be determined by species-level tolerances in conjunction with species interactions.

AB  - Sediment extraction methods to quantify metal concentration in aquatic sediments usually present limitations in accuracy and reproducibility because metal concentration in the supernatant is controlled to a large extent by the physico-chemical properties of the sediment that result in a complex interplay between the solid and the solution phase. It is suggested here that standardization of sediment extraction methods using pure mineral phases or reference material is futile and instead the extraction processes should be calibrated using site-specific sediments before their application. For calibration, time dependent release of metals should be observed for each leachate to ascertain the appropriate time for a given extraction step. Although such an approach is tedious and time consuming, using iron extraction as an example, it is shown here that apart from quantitative data such an approach provides additional information on factors that play an intricate role in metal dynamics in the environment.
   Single step ascorbate, HCl, oxalate and dithionite extractions were used for targeting specific iron phases from saltmarsh sediments and their response was observed over time in order to calibrate the extraction times for each extractant later to be used in a sequential extraction. For surficial sediments, an extraction time of 24 h, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h was ascertained for ascorbate, HCl, oxalate and dithionite extractions, respectively. Fluctuations in iron concentration in the supernatant over time were ubiquitous. The adsorption-desorption behavior is possibly controlled by the sediment organic matter, formation or consumption of active exchange sites during extraction and the crystallinity of iron mineral phase present in the sediments.

AB  - Fe-oxide reduction, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis, have been studied in a shallow aquifer with the main focus on sulfate reduction. Direct measurements of sulfate reduction rates have for the first time been applied in an aquifer system. Rates were much lower than reported in other anoxic environments - three orders of magnitude lower than in marine settings and one order of magnitude lower than in lacustrine environments, and varied substantially mainly due to differences in the reactivity of the organic matter. At the extremely low substrate levels in the aquifer, sulfate reduction rates are not primarily limited by low sulfate concentrations. The produced sulfide forms framboidal pyrite via a FeS precursor, with elemental sulfur as an intermediate. Fe-oxide reduction rates were comparable to sulfate reduction rates, but appeared to depend more on Fe-oxide reactivity than organic matter reactivity. Low sulfate concentrations, combined with low-reactivity Fe(III), in the aquifer sediment, has led to an increased appreciation of the existence of concomitant redox processes. This indicates that competitive exclusion is not always effective, and raises questions as to what H-2, data reflect in such a system. Calculations of the in situ energy yield for Fe- and sulfate reduction via H-2 oxidation are similar to 2.5 kcal/mol H-2 indicating that thermodynamic equilibrium is approached. The calculated available energy yield for methanogenesis was very low indicating that CH4 production must occur in micro-environments where higher H-2 concentrations prevail. The system may be described as being in a state of partial equilibrium, where the overall rate of organic matter oxidation is controlled by the rate of fermentation of the organic matter, and terminal electron acceptor processes occur at close to equilibrium conditions : This partial equilibrium depends on other processes in the system, in this case an increase in pH due to calcite dissolution appears to induce a shift from predominantly Fe-reducing to predominantly sulfate reducing conditions by changing the energy available to Fe-oxide reduction. Numerical modeling using the partial equilibrium approach was successful in modeling this complex of interacting processes. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Deep-sea fans are well known depot centers for organic carbon that should promote sulfate reduction. At the same time, the high rates of deposition of unconsolidated metal oxides from terrigenous origin may also promote metal-reducing microbial activity. To investigate the eventual coupling between the iron and sulfur cycles in these environments, shallow sediment cores ( < 50 cm) across various channels and levees in the Congo River deep-sea fan (similar to 5000 m) were profiled using a combination of geochemical methods. Interestingly, metal reduction dominated suboxic carbon remineralization processes in most of these sediments, while dissolved sulfide was absent. In some 'hotspot' patches, however, sulfate reduction produced large sulfide concentrations which supported chemosynthetic-based benthic megafauna. These environments were characterized by sharp geochemical boundaries compared to the iron-rich background environment, suggesting that FeS precipitation efficiently titrated iron and sulfide from the pore waters. A companion study demonstrated that methanogenesis was active in the deep sediment layers of these patchy ecosystems, suggesting that sulfate reduction was promoted by alternative anaerobic processes. These highly reduced habitats could be fueled by discrete, excess inputs of highly labile natural organic matter from Congo River turbidites or by exhumation of buried sulfide during channel flank erosion and slumping. Sulfidic conditions may be maintained by the mineralization of decomposition products from local benthic macrofauna or bacterial symbionts or by the production of more crystalline Fe(III) oxide phases that are less thermodynamically favorable than sulfate reduction in these bio-turbated sediments. Overall, the iron and sulfur biogeochemical cycling in this environment is unique and much more similar to a coastal ecosystem than a deep-sea environment.

AB  - Marsh terracing and coconut fiber mats are two wetland restoration techniques implemented at Sabine National Wildlife Refuge, Louisiana, USA. Using nekton as an indicator of habitat quality, nekton community assemblages were compared between terraced, coconut-matted, unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), and open water (pre-restoration) habitats. Using a throw trap and a 3 m x 2 m straight seine, 192 nekton samples were collected over four dates in 2001 and 2002 at all habitats. Nekton abundance was similar at unmanaged marsh (restoration goal), coconut mat, and terrace edge, and significantly higher than at open water (pre-restoration) sites (P < 0.05). Coconut-matted habitat and unmanaged marsh edges had significantly higher numbers of benthic dependent species than terrace edges (P < 0.05), potentially because of differences in substrate. Terraced sites had lower organic matter and siltier substrate as compared to unmanaged marsh sites. At Sabine NWR, terracing increased nekton use as compared to pre-restoration conditions (open water samples) by providing marsh edge habitat, but failed to support a nekton community similar to unmanaged marsh (restoration goals) or coconut-matted sites. Future restoration projects may evaluate the combined use of coconut mats with terracing projects in order to enhance habitat for benthic dependent nekton. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sediment cores collected from intertidal mudflats of Vaitarna estuary were investigated for distributions of sediment components, organic carbon, metals (iron, manganese, aluminum, copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, and lead) in bulk sediments, as well as clay-sized fraction (< 2 mu m). Sorting of grain size under the influence of varying hydrodynamic energy conditions within Vaitarna estuary was discussed. Index of geoaccumulation indicated different levels of contamination for the studied metals at three locations. Pb and Zn were mainly found to be associated with clay fraction and showed exclusive lithogenic origin. While all the other metals showed signatures of anthropogenic origin in addition to that of lithogenic.

AB  - Inactive deltas are more extensive than active deltas in most deltaic landscapes; thus, the subsurface generally is dominated by mineral sediments that rapidly accreted at different times, whereas the landscape at any one time generally is dominated by ephemeral emergent wetlands that are slowly accreting via vegetative growth. Subsidence is slow enough in most deltas that emergent wetlands, although ephemeral, can persist for millennia but accelerating global sea level rise probably will slow wetland creation in active deltas and accelerate the loss of existing wetlands in inactive deltas this century worldwide. A recent publication created confusion regarding the effects of river management on coastal Louisiana, where spatially variable subsidence is great enough in some areas to mimic extremely rapid sea level rise. I show how integrating Successional Ecology with the Delta Lobe Cycle, and correcting some omissions and errors in recent publications, clarifies the effects of river management in coastal Louisiana and provides a framework for predicting deltaic landscape dynamics worldwide. Successional Ecology provides a framework for understanding changes in natural and managed environments worldwide, whereas the Delta Lobe Cycle provides a framework for understanding river-dominated deltas worldwide. Sediment diversions are a form of river management that removes artificial barriers to river flow and are designed to mimic hydrologic conditions during the active delta stage of the Delta Lobe Cycle by focusing rapid mineral sedimentation in open water and thus creating new emergent wetlands. Freshwater diversions are another form of river management that also removes artificial barriers to river flow but are designed to mimic hydrologic conditions during the inactive stages of the Delta Lobe Cycle by reducing salinity stress over large areas of emergent wetlands and thus promoting marsh vertical accretion via vegetative growth. The Delta Lobe Cycle and both types of river diversions also create salinity gradients that simultaneously increase the sensitivity of emergent wetlands to disturbance while increasing the ability of emergent wetlands to recover from disturbance. Freshwater diversions only slow the loss of existing wetlands because the natural Delta Lobe Cycle, artificial channels that increase salinity stress, artificial ridges that increase flooding stress, and repeated disturbances eventually will cause vertical accretion via vegetative growth to become inadequate. Formally integrating these concepts might advance research and restoration in deltaic landscapes worldwide especially in the majority of deltas where inactive deltas are more extensive than active deltas.

AB  - The pore-waters from two boxcores from the Oman Margin, from sites NIOP484 and NIOP487 (respectively in and below the oxygen minimum zone in the water column), were analysed for concentrations of iodide, sulphide, thiosulphate, phosphate, silica, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, dissolved iron, dissolved manganese and dissolved sulphur. In addition, the solid phase of samples from the same cores was analysed for organic carbon, pyritic sulphur, acid volatile sulphide, elemental sulphur, organic polysulphides, humic sulphur, reactive iron phases and reactive manganese phases. Pore-water profiles show that post-oxic diagenesis dominates in these Holocene sediments. Only minor amounts of reduced sulphur species were found in pore-waters, despite the low oxygen concentration of the bottom-water and the relatively high organic-matter content of the sediments. Significant amounts of solid-phase reduced sulphur were only found in the lower half of the boxcore at station NIOP484. Consequently, sulphate reduction is not as significant in these sediments relative to sediments from other upwelling areas, and thus more sedimentary organic matter is preserved.

AB  - This study provides an analysis of the soil, vegetation types and species distribution along Rawal Dam, Rawal Lake and its three tributaries (Bani Gala, Chattar and Bari Imam Streams and its tributaries), with a focus on the environmental factors that control species distribution. After identifying the study area's herbaceous vegetation and analyzing the soil's physical and chemical parameters, the variable data were connected into a relationship. TWINSPAN (Two Way Indicator Species Analysis) classified the herbaceous vegetation into seven different communities with which; the formulated groups in DCA (Deterended Correspondance Analysis) were coherent. CCA (Canonical Correspondance Analysis) produced the relationship of soil parameters such as pH, organic matter, Potassium, Manganese, Zinc, and Iron with the herbaceous vegetation. The most effectual and varied parameter was the Potassium and Manganese that was available among the heavy metals. Thus, this study analyzed the overall relationship among soil, vegetation and the species present at the selected site.

AB  - Freshwater input has been widely used for wetland restoration. However, the consequences of freshwater input on bacteria and archaea remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Soil samples at a depth of 0-10 cm were collected in various kinds of Phragmites australis wetlands (flooded freshwater-restored (FW), nonflooding (PW) and tidal flooding (TW)) to investigate how the diversity and community structure of bacteria and archaea responded to freshwater input. The alpha-diversity metrics revealed that the bacterial richness and diversity in FW did not significantly differ from those in PW and TW (p 0.05). However, archaeal richness and diversity was higher in FW than in PW (p < 0.05). Firmicutes and Crenarchaeota constituted the predominant bacterial and archaeal phyla in FW, respectively, whereas Proteobacteria (bacteria) and Thaumarchaeota (archaea) exhibited the highest relative abundance in both PW and TW. The community structure of bacteria and archaea in TW differed from those in FW and PW, as revealed by beta diversity metrics and the analysis of similarities. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated that the largest number of discriminating bacterial and archaeal taxa was found in TW. The Mantel test and Spearman correlation analysis showed that environmental variables (i.e. salinity, soil organic matter and soil texture) influenced the bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure. And soil salinity parameters played a predominant role in shaping bacterial and archaeal communities. Overall, our findings indicated that freshwater input led to variations in bacterial and archaeal communities.

AB  - Estimating the proportions of particulate organic carbon (POC) endmembers is essential to fully understand the carbon cycle, the function of aquatic ecosystems, and the migration of contaminants in eutrophic lakes. There is currently no effective remote sensing optical algorithm in the literature to solve this problem. In this study, a POC-source color index (S-POC) was constructed based on the terrestrial and endogenous POC ratios calculated from field-measured stable isotope (delta C-13(POC)) values. The S-POC algorithm traces the sources of POC by utilizing three spectral bands centered approximately at 560 nm, 674 nm, and 709 nm, covering the intrinsic optical information of different POC sources. At the same time, the SPOC algorithm shows good applicability to Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) image data. The POC sources estimated using the algorithm and monthly OLCI data showed that from March 2018 to January 2019, the POC at the surface of Lake Taihu was mainly terrigenous. In addition, due to multiple factors such as algal blooms, plant physiology, river transport, regional rainfall, and carbon cycling, the distribution of POC sources exhibited strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Compared with other methods, it is more convenient to use remote sensing to identify the proportion of POC in different endmembers, which offers a more comprehensive understanding of the energy flows and material circulation in lakes.

AB  - The effect of Spartina alterniflora invasion stage on density and distribution pattern of Assiminea latericea was studied in 2014 and 2015 on the coast of the Yellow Sea, Jiangsu, China. Invasion of S. alterniflora altered the environmental properties. With the increase of invasion age, the coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content tended to increase, whereas chlorophyll a and salinity tended to decrease. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the habitats were separated along the gradient of the invasion stage of S. alterniflora. Coverage and stem density of S. alterniflora and salinity were the most important characters for habitat differentiation because the PCA biplot illustrated that the vectors of these environmental properties involved the smaller angles with PC 1. Based on a two-way ANOVA analysis, invasion stage of S. alterniflora and season significantly affected the density of A. latericea (p < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (p = 0. 226). The density of A. latericea varied significantly among seasons in each habitat based on a one-way ANOVA analysis, except in the bare mudflat without invasion. The highest densities occurred at the mature invasion stage in autumn, whereas the lowest densities occurred with no invasion in spring. Both Taylor's and Iwao's regressions indicated that A. latericea presented an aggregated distribution pattern (p < 0.001). The consistent distribution pattern indicated that it might be a biological trait of the species. Based on stepwise regression analysis, stem density of S. alterniflora and organic matter content were selected for the optimal regression model. Our results suggest that S. alterniflora invasion altered the environment of the coast and variation in A. latericea density was a response of the species to the environmental change caused by S. alterniflora invasion. Food resources, temperature, biological traits, and predation risk should be comprehensively considered. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exotic Spartina alterniflora, which is native to North America, has rapidly invaded the entire eastern coast of China in recent decades. It is not clear whether elevated salinity and inundation associated with accelerated sea level rises and saltwater intrusion will further increase the already dramatic rates of plant invasions in the future. In this study, we conducted controlled experiments to quantify the independent impacts of flooding salinity, flooding depth, and flooding frequency on the invasive S. alterniflora, as well as on the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter in the Yangtze River Estuary, China. The results showed that increasing flooding salinity significantly decreased the height, survival rates, number of new ramets, seed setting rates, and aboveground biomass for P. australis and S. mariqueter, whereas S. alterniflora was less severely affected than the two native species. Elevated flooding depths reduced the seed setting rates for S. alternifiora, but greatly increased the survival rates, number of new ramets, and aboveground biomass. Elevated flooding frequencies decreased the height of S. alterniflora, but promoted the generation of new ramets. In contrast, P. australis tended to have stronger negative responses to increased flooding depths and frequencies than S. alterniflora. The height and aboveground biomass of S. mariqueter also decreased significantly with the increase of flooding depths, whereas no significant decreases were observed for S. mariqueter among flooding frequency levels. Specifically, both asexual and sexual reproduction for P. australis were significantly inhibited by the foregoing experimental conditions, while S. alterniflora still had sustainable competitive advantages by either or both forms of reproduction. These findings suggest that S. alterniflora was more tolerant than native P. australis and S. mariqueter, which may facilitate the spread of invasive S. alternifiora in future scenarios of increased sea-level and saltwater intrusion, or even lead to the local extinction of the endangered S. mariqueter community.

AB  - Invasion of the exotic cordgrass, Spartina alternifiora, has become a global crisis and its spread is leading to significant alterations in the functions of ecosystems. However, alteration in nutrient levels caused by invasion of non-native plant species is poorly understood, and the effects of invasive plants on sediment nutrients found in previous studies are contradictory. In this study, we hypothesized that an exotic plant species invasion will change the chemical characteristics of an ecosystem over time. To test this hypothesis, the spatial distribution of S. alternifiora in 2006, 2010 and 2014 was analyzed by aerial images, Google Earth satellite images and field investigations. Furthermore, according to the space time reciprocal principle, a primary field survey with three locations (S1, S2 and S4) was conducted in 2014, and sediment nutrient levels, including total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alternifiora. We also investigated six locations (S1 S6) in 2016 in the same manner to compare the changes in sediment nutrients between the two years. The area infested with S. alternifiora increased from 10.8 ha in 2006, to 26.2 ha in 2010, and 37.5 ha in 2014, with a 35.6% annual expansion rate between 2006 and 2010, and a 10.8% annual expansion rate between 2010 and 2014, respectively. Considering the two field survey results, we found that S. alternifiora invasion increased sediment nutrient levels in the early-term (i.e., S1-S4 period, approximately 10 years), and then significantly decreased TC, TN and TP content to levels even lower than bare beach. Analyses of stoichiometry characteristics of the sediment nutrients also verified these two apparent stages. The results showed that early-term invasion of S. alternifiora and subsequent invasion alter sediment nutrients differently, and these results may explain the seemingly contradictory increases and decreases in nutrient levels reported in previous studies. Our results provide important information that furthers our understanding of the impact of S. alterniflora invasion.

AB  - Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coastal wetlands contribute to human well-being by providing many ecosystem services. The GOM region continues to experience substantial losses of coastal wetlands, but the magnitude of reduction in ecosystem services resulting from the loss of GOM coastal wetlands is unknown. To gain an appreciation of the impact of GOM coastal wetland loss on ecosystem services, recent literature was reviewed to derive quantitative estimates of ecosystem services provided by GOM coastal wetlands. GOM coastal wetlands provide essential habitat for the production of juvenile shrimp, which supports the GOM's most valuable commercial fishery; protect coastal communities from storm surge; improve water quality by removing nitrogen from surface waters; and are valuable sinks for greenhouse gases due to high rates of carbon sequestration combined with low rates of methane emission. Using 1998 to 2004 as a baseline, the potential loss of ecosystem services associated with loss of coastal wetlands is presented. Additional research is needed to quantify wetland services at multiple geospatial and socioeconomic scales, to determine the effect of wetland loss on ecosystem services, and to demonstrate the impact of future management decisions on the capacity of GOM coastal wetlands to provide services that affect human well-being.

AB  - The present study investigates the influence of seagrass root systems on benthic hard-shelled meiofauna (foraminifera). In February and July 2011, sediment cores were collected at low tide at two sites in Arcachon lagoon, a vegetated site with Zostera noltei and a second site with bare sediments. We used the highly discriminative CellTracker (TM) Green fluorogenic probe technique to recognize living foraminifera and to describe foraminiferal density and diversity. Three dominant species of foraminifera were observed: Ammonia tepida, Haynesina germanica and Eggerella scabra. The two calcareous species, A. tepida and H. germanica, were preferentially found in the upper half to 1 cm of the sediment. At the vegetated site, these two species had a slightly deeper microhabitat. In the literature, both species have been described alive in much deeper sediment layers, possibly due to false positives from the Rose Bengal staining method. These two species also showed 1) higher densities at the site with Z. noltei, 2) a higher density in February when conditions were supposed optimal due to a microphytobenthos bloom, and 3) dissolved calcitic shells in July, probably resulting from a lower pH. The agglutinated species E. scabra was present alive down to at least 7 cm depth. E. scabra showed high densities in the anoxic part of the sediment at both the vegetated and bare sites, with a substantially higher density in summer at the site with bare sediments. Its presence at depth may be related to its trophic requirements; this species could be less dependent on labile organic matter than A. tepida and H. germanica. On this intertidal mudflat, the foraminiferal contribution to aerobic carbon remineralization, based on respiration rate measurements, can account for up to 7% of the diffusive oxygen uptake, almost five times more than the maximum contribution recorded in open marine environments (300 m depth) in the Bay of Biscay.

AB  - Recent studies in coastal wetlands have indicated that consumers may play an important role in regulating large-scale ecosystem processes. Predator removal experiments have shown significant differences in above-ground biomass production in the presence of higher level consumers, or predators. These results indicate that predators play an important role in regulating biomass production, but the extent to which this regulation impacts additional ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and organic matter accumulation, is unclear. This study evaluated the impact that consumers have on large-scale ecosystem processes within southern New England tidal wetlands and contributes to the general understanding of trophic control in these systems. I established enclosure cages within three coastal wetlands and manipulated the presence of green crab predators to assess how trophic interactions affect ecosystem functions. Findings suggest that although these consumers may exert some top-down effects, other environmental factors, such as other consumers not studied here or bottom-up interactions, may variably play a larger role in the maintenance of ecosystem processes within the region. These results indicate that the loss of top-down control as an important mechanism influencing ecosystem functions may not hold for all wetlands along the full extent of the New England coastline.

AB  - For the past 200 years, estuarine environments experienced intense and rapid environmental degradations due to human interventions. In addition, Global Changes are modifying the estuarine physiography, leading to a restructuration of marginal marine benthic communities. The aim of this study is to document, the modern assemblage composition and the species-environment relations of benthic foraminifera upstream the Elbe Estuary (southern North Sea) and to observe what has changed since the first survey in 1981. For this purpose, a surface sampling was carried out from 22 stations along the transitional area of the Elbe Estuary. Living (roseBengal stained) and dead foraminiferal assemblages were analysed as well as hydrological and sedimentological parameters (such as salinity, pH, grain-size, and organic matter). Living faunas are characterized by very low densities and largely dominated by Ammonia species. Dead assemblages are more diverse and dominated by Ammonia aomoriensis, Haynesina germanica, and Cribroelphidium selseyense. Salinity and grain-size seem to be the major factors influencing foraminiferal distributions in the transitional area. Under the ongoing climate changes, future strategies will be taken to the application of benthic foraminifera as biomonitoring tool in the Elbe Estuary, via this baseline investigation.

AB  - Natural wetlands are effective sinks for metals. Processes of metal removal and mobilisation include sedimentation, adsorption, complexation, uptake by plants, and microbially-mediated reactions including oxidation and reduction. Recently, wetlands for wastewater purification have been constructed for treatment of sewage and urban runoff, and also show good potential for concentrating metals from industrial wastewaters and mine seepage. Constructed wetlands include open water pond-like systems, usually sediment-lined, containing floating, submerged and emergent plants. Another design is based on the use of permeable substrata such as gravel, commonly planted with emergent wetland plants such as Typha, Schoenoplectus, Phragmites or Cyperus. The wastewater percolates through the gravel, giving better access to the plant roots and rhizomes and exposure to oxygenated conditions in the rhizosphere. Hydraulic design appears to be critical to the performance of these systems, with a vertical upflow format being preferable. Generally, emergent plants influence metal storage indirectly, by modifying the substratum through oxygenation, buffering pH and adding organic matter. Total plant uptake is generally < 50% of influent metal load, while the proportion translocated to aboveground parts is usually only a few percent of input loading so that harvesting is impractical for metal removal. High metal-removal rates, close to 100%, have been reported in experimental systems for sewage and metal-amended nutrient solutions simulating acid mine drainage water, but only on the small scale or short-term. More information is required on processes of operation and recycling so that the system design can be optimised and more confidence given to predicting long-term performance.

AB  - 1 Jaumea carnosa (Less.) Gray was studied in three environmentally distinct regions of the Walker Creek marsh, California. This species was mycorrhizal at an upland site removed from tidal influences except when extreme tides coincided with winter precipitation, a tidal channel site, and a waterlogged marine site (pioneer zone). The percentage of root length colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (%AM) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the upland site (approximate to 7%), compared to either the channel (approximate to 28%) or marine sites (approximate to 17%).
   2 The vertical distribution of AM in the 40-cm rooting profile of Jaumea was, in most cases, positively associated (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01) with gravimetric soil moisture. Surprisingly, redox potential did not have a negative effect on AM. AM colonization levels were often > 20% in regions of the soil profile where redox potentials were less than 100 mV and soil moisture levels exceeded 120%.
   3 Cross-sections of host plant roots revealed the localization of arbuscules in the radial files of aerenchymatous tissue which may facilitate the survival of AM fungi in reduced soils. Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith was the dominant sporulating species from the marine site soils, while several undescribed species of Glomus dominated the channel and upland site soils. Species composition was similar in soil samples collected during dry (September) and wet (January) months.
   4 In the upland site, %AM may be suppressed by the osmotic stresses associated with seasonal extremes of salinity. For the upland and channel sites, %AM and arbuscule frequencies were greatest during the winter months of December and early March, when plants were relatively dormant. In these sites, vesicles and hyphae were most abundant during the summer months. In the waterlogged and reduced soils of the marine site, AM levels did not change seasonally despite high levels of available phosphorus.
   5 In the channel site, the tidal deposition of nitrogen-rich (and possibly spore-bearing) sediments, the presence of faunal activity in channel walls, and improved soil aeration associated with tidal inundation and retreat are among the proposed explanations for mycorrhizal abundance in this location of the Walker Creek marsh.

AB  - A stable isotope study was conducted to identify the sources of nutrition for the semelid bivalve Theora lubrica living in estuarine subtidal sediments. Along an estuarine gradient in Gokasho Bay, central Japan, delta(13)C and delta(15)N were determined both in tissues of T lubrica and its potential food sources, i.e. particulate organic matter (POM) from riverine and marine sites, sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and microalgae on an intertidal mudflat. Differences existed among delta(13)C and delta(15)N in riverine POM (yearly mean value: -26.5parts per thousand and 0.5parts per thousand, respectively), marine POM (-20.4parts per thousand, 6.3parts per thousand) and benthic microalgae (-14.7parts per thousand, 4.9parts per thousand). SOM exhibited a gradual isotopic enrichment both in C-13 and N-15 from the estuarine station adjacent to the mudflats to the more seaward stations, indicating a progressive mixing of terrestrial and marine sources. However, the isotopic composition of T lubrica did not follow this trend: as the sampling station was shifted seaward, delta(15)N increased from 7.5 to 9.4parts per thousand., whereas delta(13)C decreased from -16.0 to -17.8parts per thousand. These values cannot be due to the utilization of terrestrial organic matter carried by the river inflow. The observed spatial variation in the delta(13)C values suggest that T. lubrica has 2 dominant food sources, i.e. benthic microalgae (mainly diatoms) and marine POM (mainly coastal phytoplankton), and that in subtidal areas near the mudflats benthic microalgae were an important dietary component.

AB  - Dual stable C and N ratio analyses of primary producers and prawns have clarified the important role of mangrove detritus as the primary food source of juvenile prawns inhabiting the upper estuaries of the Matang mangrove swamp in Malaysia. The contribution of mangrove cal bon to prawn tissues, as high as 84%, decreased in the offshore direction, as the contribution by phytoplankton became progressively more important. Prawns located 2 km outside thr mangrove swamp still exhibited a dependency of 15-25% on mangrove carbon, but farther offshore (7-10 km) in shallow waters, the prawn's food was basically phytoplankton, with some contribution from benthic microalgae. Comparative stable C and N isotope ratios of tissue and gut contents indicate that prawns basically assimilated what they consumed.

AB  - The peak fallout in 1963 of the radionuclide Cs-137 has been used to date lake, reservoir, continental shelf, and wetland sedimentary deposits. In wetlands such dating is used to project the ability of wetlands to keep pace with sea level rise and develop strategies for mitigating carbon pollution using biological carbon sequestration. Here we demonstrate that reliable Cs-137 profiles are increasingly difficult to obtain from wetland soils. Among 58 soil cores recently collected from a range of wetland types and Cs-137 fallout densities across the United States, 25% contain no identifiable Cs-137 peaks. Less than 40% of Cs-137 ages are consistent with Pb-210 dating. We provide a new measure of Cs-137 peak clarity (tau) for our core dataset by comparing the 50% interquartile range of data around the Cs-137 peak for "ideal" cores profiles determined using Cs-137 fallout data to that of observed core profiles. Our results show that overall is tau approximately 10 times greater for observed cores than ideal cores. The deterioration in the Cs-137 peak has occurred due to radionuclide decay, Cs-137 migration in situ, which is ubiquitous in this study, and Cs-137 amendments from surface waters. Such deterioration likely extends to both Mexican and non-permafrost, Canadian wetlands. We recommend continued use of Cs-137 only if the full bound of dating uncertainty for both Cs-137 and an additional method such as Pb-210 is propagated into estimates of wetland vertical accretion and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Estuarine wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, providing unique habitats for fish and many terrestrial species. They also have a carbon sequestration capacity that surpasses terrestrial forest. In NSW, and most of south eastern Australia, they typically display a vegetation zonation with a sequence mudflats - mangrove forest - saltmarsh plains from the seaward margin and up the topographic gradient. Estuarine wetlands respond to sea-level rise by vertical accretion and horizontal landward migration, in order to maintain their position in the tidal frame. In situations in which accretion cannot compensate for sea-level rise and buffer areas for landward migration are not available, estuarine vegetation can be lost due to unsuitable hydraulic conditions. Predicting estuarine wetlands response to sea-level rise requires simultaneous modelling of water flow, soil and vegetation dynamics. This paper presents some preliminary results of our recently developed numerical model for wetland dynamics in wetlands of the Hunter estuary of NSW. The model continuously simulates tidal inputs into the wetland and vegetation types are determined based on their preference to prevailing hydrodynamic conditions. Accretion values based on vegetation types are computed and the topography is updated accordingly. The model is driven by local information collected over several years, which include estuary water levels, accretion rates, soil carbon content, flow resistance and vegetation preference to hydraulic conditions. Model results predict further wetland loss under an accelerated sea-level rise scenario and also under current conditions of moderate increase of estuary water levels.

AB  - Coastal populations and wetlands have been intertwined for centuries, whereby humans both influence and depend on the extensive ecosystem services that wetlands provide. Although coastal wetlands have long been considered vulnerable to sea-level rise, recent work has identified fascinating feedbacks between plant growth and geomorphology that allow wetlands to actively resist the deleterious effects of sea-level rise. Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate, nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors that influence transgression into adjacent uplands.

AB  - 1.  Transplant experiments tested the proposition that the intensity of competition within macrophyte communities varies with standing crop in a freshwater marsh in Ontario, Canada.
   2.  Transplants of three species (Carex lasiocarpa, Juncus brachycephalus, Scripus validus) were grown at sixty-six locations chosen to represent a range of standing crop values.  At each location, transplants were grown in plots with all neighbours removed and in adjacent plots with all neighbours present.
   3.  The effect of neighbours on transplant growth did not vary with standing crop, soil, or water depth, with the exception of one species which was most suppressed by neighbours in shallow water.  In contrast, the effect of neighbours on the survivorship of transplants was greatest on organic soils supporting high values of standing crop in shallow water, and least on mineral soils supporting low values of standing crop in deeper water.
   4.  The results indicated that establishment and survivorship of vegetative propagules was most likely to be affected by neighbours in shallow water, but that the growth of established plants was not influenced by neighbours anywhere.  Growth results corroborate earlier findings that competition has little effect on aquatic macrophytes.

AB  - We analyse the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the management of saline coastal wetlands in the Hunter River estuary, NSW, Australia. We model two management options: leaving all floodgates open, facilitating retreat of mangrove and saltmarsh into low-lying coastal lands; and leaving floodgates closed. For both management options we modelled the potential extent of saline coastal wetland to 2100 under a low sea-level rise scenario (based on 5 % minima of SRES B1 emissions scenario) and a high sea-level rise scenario (based on 95 % maxima of SRES A1FI emissions scenario). In both instances we quantified the carbon burial benefits associated with those actions. Using a dynamic elevation model, which factored in the accretion and vertical elevation responses of mangrove and saltmarsh to rising sea levels, we projected the distribution of saline coastal wetlands, and estimated the volume of sediment and carbon burial across the estuary under each scenario. We found that the management of floodgates is the primary determinant of potential saline coastal wetland extent to 2100, with only 33 % of the potential wetland area remaining under the high sea-level rise scenario, with floodgates closed, and with a 127 % expansion of potential wetland extent with floodgates open and levees breached. Carbon burial was an additional benefit of accommodating landward retreat of wetlands, with an additional 280,000 tonnes of carbon buried under the high sea-level rise scenario with floodgates open (775,075 tonnes with floodgates open and 490,280 tonnes with floodgates closed). Nearly all of the Hunter Wetlands National Park, a Ramsar wetland, will be lost under the high sea-level rise scenario, while there is potential for expansion of the wetland area by 35 % under the low sea-level rise scenario, regardless of floodgate management. We recommend that National Parks, Reserves, Ramsar sites and other static conservation mechanisms employed to protect significant coastal wetlands must begin to employ dynamic buffers to accommodate sea-level rise change impacts, which will likely require land purchase or other agreements with private landholders. The costs of facilitating adaptation may be offset by carbon sequestration gains.

AB  - Mangroves were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1902, providing an unusual opportunity to examine the impacts of introduced vascular plants on coastal ecosystems. Despite >100 yr residence in Hawaii, little is known regarding how mangroves alter coastal ecosystem structure. We conducted a case study of 2 Rhizophora mangle habitats in Hawaii, comparing habitat parameters and macrofaunal community structure in introduced mangroves and nearby control sandflats at a similar tidal elevation. Mangrove sediments had finer sediments and higher organic carbon concentrations and porewater salinities than sandflats. Emergent mangrove roots were colonized by the introduced barnacles Chthamalus proteus, Balanus reticulatus, and B. amphitrite and the introduced sponges Suberites zeteki, Sigmadocia caerulea, and Gelloides fibrosa. Higher densities of non-native macrofauna were found in mangrove transects than in sandflat controls, indicating that invasive mangroves facilitate the persistence of non-native fauna in Hawaii. Mangrove habitats also had higher macrofaunal species richness and diversity, as well as greater dominance by subsurface deposit feeders. Introduced mangroves substantially altered benthic community structure, in part by enhancing the structural complexity of the Hawaiian coastal environment. Because macrobenthos provide a variety of ecosystem services, e.g. serving as prey for fish and birds and promoting detrital decomposition, mangrove-induced changes in sediment community composition will likely have far-reaching consequences in Hawaii. Similar consequences of mangrove invasion are likely in other regions, as mangrove habitats expand with climate warming and increased coastal sedimentation.

AB  - Managed Realignment (MR) is becoming increasingly popular with many coastal managers and engineers. Monitoring of MR sites has provided growing evidence that many of the saltrnarshes created in these environments have lower biodiversity than naturally formed intertidal marshes, and may not fully deliver the anticipated ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and coastal flood defence. Despite the importance of the sedimentary environment in developing an intertidal morphology suitable for plant establishment and succession, the evolution of the sediment erosion, transportation, deposition and consolidation cycle in newly breached sites is rarely examined. This study evaluates the hydrodynamics and concentration of suspended sediment exported and imported along the main drainage channel within the Medmerry Managed Realignment Site, West Sussex, UK, the largest open coast realignment in Europe (at the time of breaching). Measurements were taken over a one year period (November 2015 October 2016) at the breach, at the landwards extremity where freshwater drains into the site, and in an excavated channel in the centre of the site. At the latter site, 1.7 cm of sediment accreted over the study period. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) measurements indicate that, under ambient conditions, sediment is imported into and exported from the Medmerry site, although similar concentrations of sediment were recorded being internally redistributed around the site (typically 0.11 g/l measured in the breach area compared to 0.12 g/l measured in the centre of the site). Sediment is removed from the site following large (1-2 mm/hour) rainfall events, which take several tidal cycles to drain through the site. Peaks in SSC corresponding with lower intensity rainfall events, especially during periods when the intertidal mudflats have been exposed, have also been observed. Analysis of the hydrodynamics and patterns of sedimentation during and following storm occurrences (the 2015-16 Storms Eva, Imogen and Katie) however demonstrate the relative resilience (i.e. rapid recovery and minimal disturbance) of the site to extreme storm events.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the organic matter (OM) origin in the nearshore and the surf zones adjacent to Mar Chiquita lagoon, in order to determine the importance of allochthonous estuarine detritus and in situ marine phytoplankton as carbon (C) sources for young fishes prior to entering the lagoon. Water samples from both the nearshore and the surf zones were collected for estimation of Chlorophyll a concentration, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the particulate organic matter (POM). Isotopic composition of the zooplankton and fish larvae from both zones and fish juveniles from the surf zone were also estimated. The contribution of potential OM sources was quantified by Bayesian stable isotope mixing models (SIAR). SIAR models revealed that the POM composition in the coastal area close to Mar Chiquita lagoon comprised a mix of primary producers (terrestrial and marine). The cordgrass Spartina densiflora that develops in the saltmarshes bounding the lagoon, contributed most to the POM of the surf zone, being important as a C source for zooplankton from the same zone. Towards deeper waters (10-12 m, similar to 2.5 km offshore) with higher chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton contributed most to the POM. Spartina densiflora was not relevant as a C source for larval and juvenile fishes. However, it was of importance to the group of primary consumers, which apparently sustain other zooplankton organisms that fish fed on. In this sense, the OM derived from S. densiflora and exported to the coastal area contributes to sustaining the prey for young fishes outside Mar Chiquita.

AB  - The attraction of female horse flies to unbaited and single baited Malaise traps using 1-octen-3-ol, acetone and ammonium hydroxide was studied in Eastern Croatia. Horse flies were collected in significantly higher numbers in 1-octen-3-ol baited traps than in traps baited with acetone, ammonium hydroxide or traps without these substances. The number of females of Haematopota pluvialis, Tabanus bromius, Tabanus maculicornis and Chrysops relictus collected from 1-octen-3-ol baited Malaise traps and traps with other attractants differed significantly compared with controls. Females of Hybomitra bimaculata were also collected more frequently in 1-octen-3-ol baited Malaise traps than in traps with acetone but this difference was not significant. Finally, the octenol baited Malaise traps collected 21 times more horse flies than unbaited traps, while acetone and ammonium hydroxide baited traps collected eight and four times as many flies, respectively than unbaited traps. Octenol appeared to be a very effective attractant for horse flies in Eastern Croatia.

AB  - Emergent macrophytes are a major source of organic matter production in freshwater wetlands, and often represent the bulk of the plant material entering the detrital pool. We examined the decomposition and microbial dynamics associated with litter of the emergent macrophyte, Juncus effusus (soft rush), during its movement from an aerial standing dead to a submerged decay environment. Standing dead leaves of J. effusus were collected after an initial period of standing litter microbial decay, placed in 1-mm mesh litter bags, and submerged in a wetland. Litter bags were retrieved periodically over 268 d and analyzed for microbial (fungal and bacterial) biomass and production, ATP concentrations, litter mass loss, and quality (C:N:P and plant fiber). Submerged litter decay of J, effusus was slow (k = 0.0010 d(-1)), with only 23% weight loss after 268 d. Both fungal and bacterial biomass and production decreased significantly soon after standing plant litter was submerged in the wetland surface waters. Despite decreases in microbial biomass and production, fungal decomposers remained the dominant microbial assemblage associated with decaying plant litter, accounting for 99% and 91% of the total microbial biomass and production, respectively. Mean fungal production ranged from 73-2,836 mu g C g(-1) AFDM d(-1) (AFDM: ash-free dry mass remaining) during the study period, whereas attached bacterial production ranged from 4-32 mu g C g(-1) AEDM d(-1). patterns of litter ATP and nutrient concentrations (N and P) were similar to those observed for fungal and bacterial biomass, suggesting that at least a portion of the detrital N and P may have been incorporated into microbial biomass. Significant changes in microbial colonization and activity associated with emergent macrophyte litter can occur following the collapse of standing dead plant matter to the water or surface sediments. Furthermore, our findings suggest that fungi are significant contributors to the decay of coarse particulate plant matter in wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Although it is generally acknowledged that invasions by exotic plant species represent a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of these invasions on nutrient cycling processes in the soil. The literature on plant-soil interactions strongly suggests that the introduction of a new plant species, such as an invasive exotic, has the potential to change many components of the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), water, and other cycles of an ecosystem. I have reviewed studies that compare pool sizes and flux rates of the major nutrient cycles in invaded and noninvaded systems for invasions of 56 species. The available data suggest that invasive plant species frequently increase biomass and net primary production, increase N availability, alter N fixation rates, and produce litter with higher decomposition rates than co-occurring natives. However, the opposite patterns also occur, and patterns of difference between exotics and native species show no trends in some other components of nutrient cycles (for example, the size of soil pools of C and N). In some cases, a given species has different effects at different sites, suggesting that the composition of the invaded community and/or environmental factors such as soil type may determine the direction and magnitude of ecosystem-level impacts. Exotic plants alter soil nutrient dynamics by differing from native species in biomass and productivity, tissue chemistry, plant morphology, and phenology. Future research is needed to (a) experimentally test the patterns suggested by this data set; (b) examine fluxes and pools for which few data are available, including whole-site budgets; and (c) determine the magnitude of the difference in plant characteristics and in plant dominance within a community that is needed to alter ecosystem processes. Such research should be an integral component of the evaluation of the impacts of invasive species.

AB  - A process-based carbon gas flux model was developed to calculate total macrophyte and microalgal production, and community and belowground respiration, for a Peltandra virginica dominated tidal freshwater marsh in Virginia. The model was based on measured field fluxes of CO2 and CH,, scaled to monthly and annual rates using empirically derived photosynthesis versus irradiance, and respiration versus temperature relationships. Because the gas exchange technique measures whole system gas fluxes and therefore includes turnover and seasonal translocation, estimates of total macrophyte production will be more accurate than those calculated from biomass harvests. One Limitation of the gas flux method is that gaseous carbon fluxes out of the sediment may underestimate true belowground respiration if sediment-produced gases are transported through plant tissues to the atmosphere. Therefore we measured gross nitrogen mineralization (converted to carbon units using sediment C/N ratios and estimates of bacterial growth efficiency) as a proxy for belowground carbon respiration. We estimated a total net macrophyte production of 536 to 715 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with an additional 59 g C m(-2) yr(-1) fixed by sediment microalgae. Belowground respiration calculated from nitrogen mineralization was estimated to range from 516 to 323 g C m(-2) yr(-1) versus 75 g C m(-2) yr(-1) measured directly with sediment chambers. Methane flux (72 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) accounted for 11 to 13 % of total belowground respiration. Gas flux results were combined with biomass harvest and Literature data to create a conceptual mass balance model of macrophyte-influenced carbon cycling. Spring and autumn translocation and re-translocation are critical in controlling observed seasonal patterns of above and belowground biomass accumulation. Annually, a total of 270 to 477 g C m(-2) of macrophyte tissue is available for deposition on the marsh surface as detritus or export from the marsh as particulate or dissolved carbon.

AB  - Mangrove sediments are anaerobic ecosystems rich in organic matter. This environment is optimal for anaerobic microorganisms, such as sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which are responsible for nutrient cycling. In this study, the diversity of these two functional guilds was evaluated in a pristine mangrove forest using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library sequencing in a 50 cm vertical profile sampled every 5.0 cm. DGGE profiles indicated that both groups presented higher richness in shallow samples (0-30 cm) with a steep decrease in richness beyond that depth. According to redundancy analysis, this alteration significantly correlated with a decrease in the amount of organic matter. Clone library sequencing indicated that depth had a strong effect on the selection of dissimilatory sulphate reductase (dsrB) operational taxonomic units (OTUs), as indicated by the small number of shared OTUs found in shallow (0.0 cm) and deep (40.0 cm) libraries. On the other hand, methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) libraries indicated that most of the OTUs found in the shallow library were present in the deep library. These results show that these two guilds co-exist in these mangrove sediments and indicate important roles for these organisms in nutrient cycling within this ecosystem.

AB  - Extensive Salicornia beds along the Gulf of Kutchchh (northwest) and Tamilnadu (southeast) coasts were investigated with respect to vegetative structure and ambient environmental conditions. The width of the beds varied from approximately 5 in to 1000 in, depending upon the topography and tidal influence. The most extensive and healthy stands occurred in the regularly (20-50 tides month(-1)) inundated intertidal zones. The width of Salicornia beds in the Gulf of Kutchchh was greater than those along the Tamilnadu coast due to greater (0.83-7.2 in) tidal amplitude and flat topography. The sediments from beds of the Gulf of Kutchchh were rich (4.9-16.9% dry weight) in organic matter. The salt content in the sediments from Tamilnadu was relatively very low (0.08-0.1% dry weight) compared to sediments from the Gulf of Kutchchh (0.48-0.78% dry weight). Plant biomass, density, height, and frequency of occurrence in the more frequently inundated regions were greater than in the poorly or less frequently inundated intertidal regions. The average total biomass varied from 0.2 to 4.5 kg (dry weight) m(-2) and was mostly comprised of aboveground components. Peak biomass values of Salicornia were observed during September to February in the Gulf of Kutchchh, while along the southeast coast, they were observed during December to March. The growth of the S. brachiata seemed to be influenced primarily by the frequency of inundation, duration of atmospheric exposure at ebb tide, rainfall, and salinity and salt content of the ambient water and sediments, respectively. Average carbon and nitrogen content in the plants were estimated to be 21.7 +/- 1.9% and 0.8 +/- 0.17% (dry weight), respectively. The carbon content increased with increasing age of the plant, while protein content decreased. Constantly increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal wetlands warrant immediate protection of S. brachiata and other obligate halophytes, which are either threatened/vulnerable or endangered.

AB  - Sediment deposition and accretion rates in a Virginia tidal freshwater marsh were measured to provide insight to the processes and time scales that are important for maintaining marsh surface elevation. Short-term sediment deposition rates (biweekly to monthly) measured using sediment collection tiles were spatially and temporally variable. Rates were greatest near a tidal creak and decreased along a transect extending toward the marsh interior. When integrated across the entire marsh, annual sediment deposition (as organic carbon) averaged 517 +/- 353 g C m(-2) y(-1) and was sufficient to balance the effects of existing relative sea level rise and marsh respiration rates. At the creekbank, the highest deposition rates were measured during summer although rates were relatively constant over time at the interior sites. Similar spatial and temporal patterns were obtained when deposition rates were calculated from Be-7 inventories (monthly time scale). Sediment inventories of Be-7 were greater than those supported atmospherically, indicating that the spatial patterns of sedimentation were not due to sediment erosion and redistribution within the marsh. Accretion rates calculated from Cs-137 (decadal scale) and C-14 dating (centuries to millennia) were substantially less than annual deposition rates, with a decrease in accretion rate with increasing time scale. Mineralization rates of recently deposited sediments (measured as O-2 consumption) indicated that sediment metabolism could potentially remove similar to30% of recently deposited carbon within one month of deposition. The metabolism of a labile sediment fraction could explain a portion of the observed decrease in accretion rate with increasing time scale, with the remainder due to periodic storm-induced erosion and historical variability in sediment deposition rates.

AB  - Management and restoration of coastal wetlands require insight into how inundation, salinity, and the availability of mineral sediment and nutrients interact to influence ecosystem functions that control sustainability. The Mississippi River Delta, which ranks among the world's largest and most productive coastal wetland complexes, has experienced extensive deterioration over the last century due, in large part, to enhanced vulnerability to relative sea-level rise and lateral erosion caused by a combination of natural processes and anthropogenic modifications of hydrology. This land loss crisis has prompted the State of Louisiana to develop a comprehensive restoration plan that includes constructing and implementing a series of large-scale sediment diversions that will reconnect sediment- and nutrient-rich Mississippi River water to adjacent bays, estuaries, and wetlands. Sediment loading through diversions is predicted to enhance the long-term sustainability of coastal wetlands; however, the additive effects of increased inundation, abrubt changes in the salinity regime, and high nutrient loads on wetland plant growth and organic matter (SOM) decomposition rates, which help regulate accretion and elevation change, is uncertain. Therefore, this review attempts to synthesize existing information to inform predictions of the interactive effects of diversions on these drivers of coastal wetland sustainability. The data suggest that sediment deposition within an optimal elevation range will increase the overall productivity of existing wetlands where prolonged flooding does not counter this effect by limiting plant growth. A reduction in salinity may increase plant productivity and cause vegetation shifts to less salt tolerant species, but seasonal swings in salinity may have unforeseen consequences. Nutrient-loading is predicted to lead to greater above-ground productivity, which, in turn, can facilitate additional sediment trapping; however, belowground productivity may decline, particularly in areas where sediment deposition is limited. In areas experiencing net deposition, nutrient-enrichment is predicted to enhance belowground growth into new sediment and contribute to positive effects on soil organic matter accumulation, accretion, and elevation change. Thus, we contend that sediment input is essential for limiting the negative effects of flooding and nutrient-enrichment on wetland processes. These conclusions are generally supported by the biophysical feedbacks occurring in existing pro grading deltas of the Mississippi River Delta complex.

AB  - Anthropogenic coastal activities and natural stressors aggravate degradation of small coastal patches of mangroves, which in turn destroy local resilience of mangrove forests in the Indian Sundar-bans, the continuous mangrove habitat that spans between India and Bangladesh. We conducted an analytical survey across 19 shoreline mangrove fringes spanning the Sundarbans, including both healthy and disturbed forests, and evaluated ninetyfive 60-cm composite sediment cores across a degradation and salinity gradient from similar to 4 to similar to 12 ppt. Increased salinity and anoxicity greatly inhibited nutrient cycling and release by microbial decomposers, subsequently resulting in nutrient-poor soil as a condition of degradation. Nutrient limitation, salinity rise, anoxicity increase, and sulfide build-up negatively controlled forest structure causing declines of forest coverage from similar to 98 to similar to 11%. In addition, the tide-dominated salinity gradient controlling species zonation was disrupted in disturbed forests with salinity-sensitive species gradually disappearing. An obvious change in species distribution is anticipated while salt-sensitive Heritiera fomes, Xylocarpus spp., and Phoenix paludosa failed to cope with increased salinity, evident by their absence from many forests. Excoecaria agallocha and Avicennia spp. acclimated well and expanded freely into degraded forests across the Sundarbans. Overall, our study strongly establishes salinity intrusion as primary mechanism for mangrove degradation.

AB  - A primary goal of many coastal restoration programs is to increase nekton habitat in terms of both quantity and quality. Using shallow water ponds rehabititated with a technique called marsh terracing, we examined the quality of nekton habitat created, using and comparing several metrics including nekton density and diversity, functional group composition, and weight-length relationships as indirect measures of habitat quality. We examined three paired terraced and unterraced marsh ponds in southwest Louisiana. Nekton, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and soil and water quality variables were sampled bimonthly from April 2004 through April 2005 at four subtidal habitat types: terraced nearshore, terraced open water, unterraced nearshore, and unterraced open water. Results indicate that terraced ponds had increased the habitat value of degrading unterraced ponds over open water areas for estuarine nekton; nekton density and richness were similar between terraced and unterraced nearshore habitat types, but greater at all nearshore as compared to open water sites. Analysis of the distribution of nekton functional groups and weight:length ratios indicates the terraced and unterraced pond habitats were not functioning similarly: distribution of nekton functional groups differed significantly between habitat types with greater percentages of benthic-oriented species at unterraced open water habitats and higher percentage of open water species in terraced ponds as compared to unterraced ponds, and two of the six numerically dominant fish species had greater weight-length relationships in unterraced ponds as compared to terraced ponds. This lack of functional equivalency may be attributed to environmental differences between terraced and unterraced ponds such as water depth or SAV biomass, or the relatively young age of the terraces studied, which may not have allowed for the development of some critical habitat variables, such as soil organic matter that was found to be significantly lower in terraced versus unterraced ponds (p < 0.05). To properly assess the ecological equivalency of restored or rehabilitated sites for nekton requires that we move beyond measures of nekton density, biomass, and diversity and incorporate measures of functional equivalency, including habitat measures.

AB  - Microbial production of methane is an important terminal metabolic process during organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It is generally acknowledged that hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis constitute the dominant pathways of methane production; the importance of methanogenesis from methylated compounds remains poorly understood. We conducted various biogeochemical and molecular genetic analyses to characterize substrate availability, rates of methanogenesis, and methanogen community composition, and further evaluated the contribution of different substrates and pathways for methane production in deltaic surface and subsurface sediments of the Western Mediterranean Sea. Major substrates representing three methanogenic pathways, including H-2, acetate, and methanol, trimethylamine (TMA), and dimethylsulfide (DMS), were detected in the pore waters and sediments, and exhibited variability over depth and between sites. In accompanying incubation experiments, methanogenesis rates from various C-14 labeled substrates varied as well, suggesting that environmental factors, such as sulfate concentration and organic matter quality, could significantly influence the relative importance of individual pathway. In particular, methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis contributed to the presence of micromolar methane concentrations in the sulfate reduction zone, with methanogenesis from methanol accounting for up to 98% of the total methane production in the topmost surface sediment. In the sulfate-depleted zone, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant methanogenic pathway (67-98%), and enhanced methane production from acetate was observed in organic-rich sediment (up to 31%). Methyl coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA) analysis revealed that the composition of methanogenic communities was generally consistent with the distribution of methanogenic activity from different substrates. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of methylotrophic methanogenesis in marine sediments and has important implications for marine methane cycling. The occurrence of methylotrophic methanogenesis in surface sediments could fuel the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in the shallow sulfate reduction zone. Release of methane produced from methylotrophic methanogenesis could be a source of methane efflux to the water column, thus influencing the benthic methane budgets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solar UV radiation, climate and other drivers of global change are undergoing significant changes and models forecast that these changes will continue for the remainder of this century. Here we assess the effects of solar UV radiation on biogeochemical cycles and the interactions of these effects with climate change, including feedbacks on climate. Such interactions occur in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. While there is significant uncertainty in the quantification of these effects, they could accelerate the rate of atmospheric CO2 increase and subsequent climate change beyond current predictions. The effects of predicted changes in climate and solar UV radiation on carbon cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are expected to vary significantly between regions. The balance of positive and negative effects on terrestrial carbon cycling remains uncertain, but the interactions between UV radiation and climate change are likely to contribute to decreasing sink strength in many oceanic regions. Interactions between climate and solar UV radiation will affect cycling of elements other than carbon, and so will influence the concentration of greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases. For example, increases in oxygen-deficient regions of the ocean caused by climate change are projected to enhance the emissions of nitrous oxide, an important greenhouse and ozone-depleting gas. Future changes in UV-induced transformations of aquatic and terrestrial contaminants could have both beneficial and adverse effects. Taken in total, it is clear that the future changes in UV radiation coupled with human-caused global change will have large impacts on biogeochemical cycles at local, regional and global scales.

AB  - This article describes the use of group model building to facilitate interaction with stakeholders, synthesize research results and assist in the development of hypotheses about climate change at the global level in relation to UV-B radiation and ecosystem service valuation. The objective was to provide a platform for integration of the various research components within a multidisciplinary research project as a basis for interaction with stakeholders with backgrounds in areas other than science. An integrated summary of the scientific findings, along with stakeholder input, was intended to produce a bridge between science and policymaking. We used a mediated modeling approach that was implemented as a pilot project in Ushuaia, Argentina. The investigation was divided into two participatory workshops: data gathering and model evaluation. Scientists and the local stakeholders supported the valuation of ecosystem services as a useful common denominator for integrating the various scientific results. The concept of economic impacts in aquatic and marsh systems was represented by values for ecosystem services altered by UV-B radiation. In addition, direct local socioeconomic impacts of enhanced UV-B radiation were modeled, using data from Ushuaia. We worked with 5 global latitudinal regions, focusing on net primary production and biomass for the marine system and on 3 plant species for the marsh system. Ecosystem service values were calculated for both sectors. The synthesis model reflects the conclusions from the literature and from experimental research at the global level. UV-B is not a significant stress for the marshes, relative to the potential impact of increases in the sea level. Enhanced UV-B favors microbial dynamics in marine systems that could cause a significant shift from primary producers to bacteria at the community level. In addition, synergetic effects of UV-B and certain pollutants potentiate the shift to heterotrophs. This may impact the oceanic carbon cycle by increasing the ratio of respiratory to photosynthetic organisms in surface waters and, thus, the role of the ocean as a carbon sink for atmospheric CO2. In summary, although changes in the marine sector due to anthropogenic influences may affect global climate change, marshes are expected to primarily be affected by climate change.

AB  - Wetlands are highly productive natural ecosystems, providing valuable goods and services. There is growing interest in transferring ecosystem service value from the existing wetlands studied to other wetlands ecosystems at a large geographic scale. The benefit transfer method uses the known values from wetlands to predict the value of other wetland sites. This methodology requires only limited time and resources. The present study calculated the value of the ecological services provided by lake and marsh wetlands in China in terms of biodiversity indices, water quality indices and economic indices. Basic data on wetlands were obtained through remote sensing images. The results show that: 1) The total ecosystem service value of the lake and marsh wetlands in 2008 was calculated to be 8.1841 x 10(10) United States Dollars (USD), with the marsh and lake wetlands contributing 5.6329 x 10(10) and 2.5512 x 10(10) USD, respectively. Values of marsh ecosystem service were concentrated in Heilongjiang Province (2.5516 x 10(10) USD), Qinghai Province (1.2014 x 10(10) USD), and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (1.1884 x 10(10) USD). The value of the lakes were concentrated in Tibet Autonomous Region (6.223 x 10(9) USD), Heilongjiang (5.810 x 10(9) USD), and Qinghai (5.500 x 10(9) USD). 2) Waste treatment and climate regulation services contributed to 26.29% and 24.74% respectively, of the total ecosystem service value of the marsh wetlands. Hydrological regulation and waste treatment contributed to 41.39% and 32.75%, respectively, of the total ecosystem service value of the lake wetlands. 3) The total ecological service value of the lake and marsh wetlands was 54.64% of the total service value of natural grassland ecosystems and 30.34% of the total service value of forests ecosystems in China.

AB  - Streams, rivers, and freshwater marshes often depend on plant litter as a source of carbon, nutrients, and energy that drive ecosystem processes. Decomposition of this organic matter, such as leaves, wood, or emergent macrophytes, is mediated mostly by fungi, whereas the role of bacteria is minor. Fungal colonization leads to enzymatic breakdown of major plant polymers and fungal biomass accrual (often around 10% of total detrital dry mass), which makes decaying plant material more palatable to detritivorous invertebrates. Representatives of almost all major groups of fungi can be isolated from decaying plant litter collected in freshwater ecosystems or detected using molecular techniques; however, ascomycetes, including their asexual stages (e.g., aquatic hyphomycetes in streams), predominate. In recent years, utilization of radioisotopic approaches (e.g., acetate incorporation into ergosterol) to estimate fungal growth rates and production has facilitated the construction of partial carbon budgets for decaying plant litter that illustrate the importance of fungal decomposers in both lotic and lentic systems. For example, some estimates suggest that 23-60% of leaf litter carbon loss in streams can be explained by fungal assimilation (production plus respiration), which does not include fungal-mediated losses as fine particulate or dissolved organic carbon. Estimates of fungal contribution to plant carbon loss can be even higher (47-65%) in standing-dead emergent macrophyte systems in wetlands. The effects of environmental variables on fungal activity and plant litter decomposition in freshwaters, including inorganic nutrient availability and eutrophication, have also received considerable attention in the recent years. Molecular approaches are now becoming increasingly important in both streams and wetlands to assess the effects of environmental variables on litter-associated fungal assemblages. However, there are considerable differences in fungal dynamics and assemblages between streams and freshwater wetlands, which are discussed here in detail.

AB  - While the importance of canopy-forming algae in structuring ecosystems is recognized, their role in the carbon budget is still not well understood. To our knowledge, no measurements of rocky shores primary production and respiration under emersion periods have been carried out in situ. A benthic chamber coupled to a CO2-infrared gas analyzer was used to measure gross primary production and respiration on the Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol. zone of a sheltered rocky shore in Brittany, France. Over a year of monthly measurements on the zone with and without the A. nodosum canopy showed fairly high production and respiration values for the global community as well as carbon fluxes due to the canopy that largely dominated the benthic metabolism of the zone. The strong canopy respiration relative to the primary production also suggested a high metabolic activity by microscopic heterotrophs on the surface of the alga. Both the canopy and the understory annual primary production and respiration were under the control of light and temperature seasonal variations. Finally, the range of the amount of carbon produced on the A. nodosum zone during diurnal emersions was estimated. Additional measures accounting for the day-night cycles and seasonal light variations over an entire tidal cycle are, however, necessary to establish an annual carbon budget. Such measures using the benthic chamber together with complementary techniques would allow a better understanding of the functioning of sheltered rocky shores.

AB  - Differences between measured Cs-137 activity-depth profiles and idealised undisturbed profiles generated from an exponential model suggest that faunal turbation has redistributed Cs-137 in mineral and organic upland soils in southern Scotland, Bioturbation is also demonstrated by the vertical displacement of other inputs to the soils of known age (non-native tree pollen and spheroidal carbonaceous particles, SCPs). The causes and mechanisms of bioturbation were Further investigated by soil micromorphology. Well-drained mineral soils with active populations of earthworms are the most bioturbated, showing near-complete homogenisation to depths of about 20 cm. Enchytraeids also seem to remobilise Cs-137 by the digestion of organic matter and may be the main cause of Cs-137 redistribution in organic-rich upland soils. Relative rates of mixing are evaluated by comparing Cs-137 depth profiles. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the geochemistry of Fe in a minerotrophic wetland in Central New York. Fine-scale geochemical trends in the peat and peat porewater were investigated to evaluate detailed vertical profiles of Fe in solution. Two sites within the wetland were examined: one site adjacent to an agricultural field receiving nutrient inputs and another (pristine) site in the middle of the wetland. Results revealed that Fe(II) was produced in situ in the wetland, most probably as a result of microbial Fe(III) reduction. Iron(II) concentration profiles suggested the existence of Fe(III) reduction in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field, whereas no significant evidence for Fe(III) reduction occurred in the pristine zone. Theoretical equilibrium modeling predicted that the difference in soluble Fe concentrations between the two zones was probably caused by abiotic reactions, such as pyrite precipitation. Geochemically, a correlation between Fe(II) and bulk density showed the importance of Fe reduction in the decomposition of organic matter in the organic rich peat and demonstrated the importance of the mineralogical composition for the reduction of Fe(III). Finally, a unique reversal of Fe and SO42- reduction was discovered in the zone adjacent to the agricultural field. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Distribution of seven major and trace elements (aluminum, iron, calcium, cobalt, copper, vanadium and manganese) and total organic matter were assessed for sediment cores, collected from the southwest of Caspian Sea sediment in September 2008. Sedimentation rate of 0.9 cm/year was obtained based on (210) Pb and (137) Cs activity study of sediment cores. The major and trace metal distributions over whole lengths of core lengths (14-168 cm) were found to be uniform (except for Al, Fe and Ca). Such uniform distribution of elements over whole lengths of the cores of the study area indicates similarity among the lithogenous material delivered into the Caspian Sea by rivers running into the southern coast. Enrichment factor (EF) and modified Muller's formula of geoaccumulation index I (poll) (intensity of pollution) evaluated the degree of sediment contamination. The results of pollution indices are indicative of non-pollution status in the area of study. From the first to third transect, Al, Fe and Mn concentrations increase. Heavy metal concentrations show relatively lower elemental concentrations in the third transect, possibly due to distance from anthropogenic sources. Cluster analysis shows Cu and Co grouped in different clusters, while Mn, V and Fe display closer similarity coefficients and similar sources. The results of partition studies reveal the percentile of loose ions portion of the metals as:
   Cu(25.4%) > Co(15.1%) > Mn(7.5%) > V(5.8%) > Fe(0.2%)
   It shows that Cu and Co are the most mobile metals that can be easily released into water under changing environmental conditions. There seems to be a slight increasing trend in the pollution level of the sediments of the study area for copper and cobalt over the last 60 years.

AB  - The formation of iron sulphide minerals exerts significant control on the behaviour of trace elements in sediments. In this study, three short sediment cores, retrieved from the remote Antinioti lagoon (N. Kerkyra Island, NW Greece), are investigated concerning the solid phase composition, distribution, and partitioning of major (Al, Fe) and trace elements (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn). According to Pb-210, the sediments sampled correspond to depositions of the last 120 years. The high amounts of organic carbon (4.1-27.5%) result in the formation of Fe sulphides, predominantly pyrite, already at the surface sediment layers. Pyrite morphologies include monocrystals, polyframboids, and complex FeS-FeS2 aggregates. According to synchrotron-generated micro X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra, authigenically formed, Mn-containing, Fe(III) oxyhydroxides (goethite type) co-exist with pyrite in the sediments studied. Microscopic techniques evidence the formation of galena, sphalerite and CuS, whereas sequential extractions show that carbonates are important hosts for Mn, Cd, and Zn. However, significant percentages of non-lattice held elements are bound to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides that resist reductive dissolution (on average 60% of Pb, 46% of Cd, 43% of Zn and 9% of Cu). The partitioning pattern changes drastically in the deeper part of the core that is influenced by freshwater inputs. In these sediments, the post-depositional pyritization mechanism, illustrated by overgrowths of Fe monosulphides on preexisting pyrite grains, results in relatively high degree of pyritization that reaches 49% for Cd, 66% for Cu, 32% for Zn and 7% for Pb.

AB  - Widespread land use change in coastal ecosystems has led to a decline in the amount of habitat available for fish and wildlife, lower production of ecosystem goods and services, and loss of recreational and aesthetic value. This has prompted global efforts to restore the natural hydrologic regimes of developed shorelines, especially resource-rich estuaries, but the resilience of these restored ecosystems in the face of accelerated sea-level rise (SLR) remains uncertain. We implemented a Monitoring-based Simulation of Accretion in Coastal Estuaries (MOSAICS) in R statistical software to address uncertainty in the resilience of modified estuarine habitats, using the Nisqually River Delta in the Pacific Northwest USA as a case study. MOSAICS is a spatially explicit model with a numerical foundation that uses empirical monitoring datasets to forecast habitat change in response to rising tidal levels. Because it accounts for the crucial ecomorphodynamic feedbacks between tidal inundation, vegetative growth, and sediment accretion, MOSAICS can be used to determine whether alternative management scenarios, such as enhanced sediment inputs, will bolster estuarine resilience to SLR. Under moderate SLR (0.62 m), the model predicted that a two-fold increase in mean daily suspended sediment during the rainy season was sufficient to maintain Nisquallys emergent marshes through 2100, but under high SLR (1.35 m) MOSAICS indicated that greater sediment additions would be necessary to prevent submergence. A comparison between a restored marsh with subsided and high-elevation areas and a relict marsh demonstrated that the subsided restoration area was highly susceptible to SLR. Findings from the MOSAICS model highlight the importance of a sites initial elevation, capacity for producing above and belowground biomass, and suspended sediment availability when considering management actions in estuaries and other coastal ecosystems.

AB  - In this review several aspects of the functioning of the Dutch estuaries (Ems-Dollard, Wadden Sea, Oosterschelde, Westerschelde, Grevelingen and Veerse Meer) have been compared. A number of large European rivers (especially Rhine) have a prevailing influence on the nutrient cycling of most Dutch estuaries. Owing to the increased loading of the estuaries with nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, effects of eutrophication on the biological communities could be demonstrated, mainly in the western Wadden Sea. The causality, however, of the relation between increased nutrient loading and increased biomass and production of primary producers in the turbid tidal Dutch ecosystems is questioned. The most obvious biological effects of eutrophication have been observed in a non-tidal brackish lagoon, Veerse Meer. The estuarine food web received major attention. Budget studies of the main primary producers revealed a dominance of phytoplankton in all Dutch estuaries, followed by microphytobenthos in the tidal systems and macrophytes in the lagoons. The quantitative distribution of primary producers and primary and secondary consumers shows remarkable similarities along the physical and chemical estuarine gradients, notwithstanding the large variability in space and the considerable inconstancy over time. Among the secondary consumers (waterfowl, marine fish, larger invertebrates) the levels of organic carbon consumption - expressed in g C m-2 y-1 - are almost the same, when tidal estuaries are compared with non-tidal lagoons, notwithstanding the fact that the consumer populations show large qualitative differences. The transfer from primary consumers to secondary consumers reveals a bottle neck: especially during late winter, when macrozoobenthos reaches its lowest biomass, food may be a serious limiting resource for large numbers of migratory waders foraging on the intertidal flats. The consequences of the Deltaplan , the closure of several estuaries in the southwest of the Netherlands and their subsequent transfer into non-tidal lagoons, offer complicated case studies of ecosystem changes. Several examples of long-term trends in ecosystem development in Grevelingen lagoon have been discussed.

AB  - Plant invasion has been reported to alter ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes and pools. The mechanisms involved in how plant invasion affects the soil microbial community-the primary mediator of soil C and N cycling-remain poorly understood. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the effect of plant invasion on the soil microbial community in a coastal wetland of eastern China.
   We investigated the impact of an exotic C-4 perennial grass, Spartina alterniflora, on the soil microbial community structure based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis and chloroform fumigation-extraction by comparing it to that of bare flat and native C-3 plants Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities.
   Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil microbial biomass C and the total and various types of PLFAs compared with bare flat, Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis communities. Increased concentrations of soil moisture, electrical conductivity, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total, labile and recalcitrant soil organic C and N, and decreased soil pH in Spartina alterniflora community explained 65.9 % of the total variability in the PLFAs. WSOC and soil labile organic N were strongly correlated with PLFAs, whereas soil pH was negatively related to PLFAs.
   A 10-year Spartina alterniflora invasion significantly altered soil microbial biomass and community structure by increasing available substrate. The changes in soil microbial biomass and community structure may in turn enhance soil C and N sequestration in a coastal wetland of eastern China.

AB  - Short-term sedimentation patterns were evaluated from August 1992 to May 1993 in different wetland habitats characteristic of the Rhone Delta, including impounded and seasonally-dry saline Arthrocnemum marshes, brackish Juncus, Phraginites, and Scirpus riverine wetlands directly connected to the Rhone River, and Arthrocnemum-dominated marine marshes influenced by the Mediterranean. Short-term sedimentation was measured as sediment accumulation on paper filters which had been placed on the soil surface for several weeks. Total sedimentation and material lost on ignition was significantly related to individual sampling periods, reflecting the importance of short-term processes. High sedimentation at riverine sites (up to 22 g m(-2) d(-1)) was related to a combination of river stage and wind events. Marine and impounded wetlands of the Rhone Delta experienced low sedimentation throughout the period of study. Sedimen tation rates averaged over the study period were 0.8 g m(-2) d(-1), 1.8 g m(-2) d(-1), and 5.4g m(-2) d(-1) for marine, impounded, and riverine sites, respectively. Percent material lost on ignition was low in all habitats (average 15%) and followed a seasonal trend with a minimum in late fall and winter (1%). Soil percent organic matter was also low in the top several centimeters (13%), suggesting that inorganic sedimentation is very important for accretion on these wetland surfaces. Coastal flooding was not a significant mechanism for sedimentation in the marine sites during the period of study. Sedimentation is an important factor in elevation change, and this study shows that impounded habitats, the most common "natural environment" left in the delta, may become vulnerable to sea-level rise in the future if management practices continue to isolate these wetlands from riverine sources of sediment.

AB  - Vegetation and soil are important factors in coastal wetland landscape evolution. This paper investigates the relationship between the aboveground biomass of Spartina alterniflora and soil factors of varying settling ages in Yancheng, China using correlation analysis and principal component analysis. The results indicate the following: (1) Soil factors varied significantly with different settlement ages of S. alterniflora that expanded toward the land and sea. Soil bulk density decreased with settlement age and was lowest for growth period IV (10 - 16 year old sites) whereas an opposite trend was shown for soil moisture. Soil salinity and soil nutrients were highest for growth period III (6 - 10 year old sites) (2) Principal component analysis demonstrated that soil bulk density, moisture and salinity are the main soil factors that drive landscape evolution in S. alterniflora marshes. (3) There was a significant positive correlation between S. alterniflora biomass and the organic matter and bulk density of soil (p < 0.05). Results showed that the invasion and settlement of S. alterniflora in the coastal wetland of Yancheng are changing the physical and chemical properties of the coastal wetland soil. This study has contributed to an understanding of wetland succession in the coastal landscape.

AB  - This article considers how "rolling covenants" (i.e., covenants on land title that can operate in a "rolling" geographic area to keep pace with sea-level rise) can be used to permit productive use of land in the short term, while ensuring land use can shift over time to allow for coastal ecosystem migration in the medium to long term. We use Australia as a case study, and through analysis of legislation and a series of semistructured interviews, we demonstrate how land title-based covenants can be used to give legal effect to "rolling covenant" arrangements where land is subject to existing use and occupation. We then consider practical issues associated with drafting a rolling covenant arrangement, including an analysis of the types of events or scenarios that could be used as a basis for land use changing (e.g., projected sea-level rise, actual ecosystem migration), and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We conclude that rolling covenants are a viable option for land management in the coastal zone, especially in circumstances where funding sources are available to incentivize uptake. Rolling covenants may provide opportunities for coastal wetlands to be maintained and even enhanced in cover, thereby delivering important ecosystem services (e.g., blue carbon) into the future.

AB  - metabolic balance of the open waters supporting submerged macrophytes of the Donana marsh (SW Spain) was investigated in spring, when community production is highest. The marsh community (benthic + pelagic) was net autotrophic with net community production rates averaging 0.61 g C m(-2) d(-1), and gross production rates exceeding community respiration rates by, on average, 43%. Net community production increased greatly with increasing irradiance, with the threshold irradiance for communities to become net autotrophic ranging from 42 to 255 mu E m(-2) s(-1), with net heterotrophic at lower irradiance. Examination of the contributions of the benthic and the pelagic compartments showed the pelagic compartment to be strongly heterotrophic (average P/R ratio = 0.27), indicating that the metabolism of the pelagic compartment is highly subsidised by excess organic carbon produced in the strongly autotrophic benthic compartment (average P/R = 1.58).

AB  - Aquatic organisms that produce epibenthic structures such as saltmarsh plants play key roles in habitat functioning through their ecosystem engineering effects. Intertidal Spartina species are well known for modifying tidal hydrodynamic and sediment processes, affecting cohabiting infaunal organisms. The stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius is an infaunal filter-feeding species that inhabits a broad range of mudflats (MF) and Spartina saltmarshes (SM) along the American Atlantic coast. Through descriptive and experimental approaches conducted at the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina, 38 degrees 47'S, 62 degrees 20'W), we evaluated ecosystem engineer effects of Spartina alterniflora (due to changes in sediment and water characteristics) on somatic and shell growth of T. plebeius. Comparison of bulk sediment parameters indicated that the sediment is more easily eroded in the SM than in the MF, but softer in the latest. In addition, food supply for clams (i.e., total particulate organic matter) was higher in the MF although food quality (i.e., percentage of organic matter in the water column) was in general higher in SM. Shell growth was higher but clam condition index (CI) was lower in the MF, and the opposite pattern was found in the SM. These results represent an uncoupling between shell and somatic growth with a positive effect of S. alterniflora on the Cl of clams. Nevertheless, results of field experiments manipulating stems and roots of plants separately suggested that the effect of Spartina on clam's Cl was not due to the structural changes generated by plant presence itself, although a better food quality in the SM may be related to the larger clam.

AB  - The exchange of dissolved nutrients between marshes and the inundating water column was measured using throughflow marsh flumes built in two microtidal Louisiana estuaries:  the Barataria Basin estuary and Fourleague Bay.  The flumes were sampled between September 1986 and April 1988, coincident with an extended period of low sea level on the Louisiana coast.  The Barataria Basin estuary is in the later, deteriorating stage of the deltaic cycle, characterized by low freshwater inputs and subsiding marshes.  Both brackish and saline marshes supplied dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen (ammonium + nitrate + nitrite = DIN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total nitrogen (as total Kjeldahl nitrogen = TKN) to the water column.  The export of DIN is probably related to the N accumulated in earlier stages of deltaic development and released as these marshes deteriorate.  Coastal brackish marshes of Fourleague Bay, part of a accreting marsh system in an early, developmental stage of the deltaic cycle, exported TKN to the open water estuary in all samplings.  This marsh apparently acted as a short-term buffer of DIN by taking up NH4+ in spring, when baywide concentrations were high, and supplying DIN to the estuary in summer and fall, when concentrations in the bay were lower.  Differences in phosphorus (P), DOC, and DON fluxes between these two estuaries were also observed.  The Fourleague Bay site exported soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) and imported DOC.  This P export may be related to remobilization of sediment-bound riverine P by the reducing soils of the marshes.  Fluxes of SRP at the Barataria Basin sites were variable and low while DOC was imported.  Most imports of dissolved nutrients were correlated with higher upstream [source] concentrations, and flux rates were fairly consistent throughout the tide.  Dissolved nutrients exports did not correlate with upstream concentrations, though, and in many cases the flux was dominated by early flood tide nutrient release.  This pulsed behavior may be caused by rapid diffusion from the sediments early in the tidal cycle, when the sediment-water concentration gradient is largest.  Interestuary differences were also seen in particulate organic matter fluxes, as the Fourleague Bay marsh exported POC and PON during all samplings while Barataria Basin imported these nutrients.  In general, the magnitude and direction of nutrient exchanges in Louisiana marshes seem to reflect the deltaic successional stage of the estuary.

AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was used to examine the food sources and trophic structure of 17 fish species and six groups of benthic macroinvertebrates in a seagrass meadow in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The seagrass, their associated epiphytes, sediment organic matter (SOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) were identified to be the food sources, with delta C-13 values ranging from -19.49 (POM) to -9.66% (seagrass). The delta C-13 of the 23 fauna taxa were between -18.57 (Arothron manilensis) and -11.62 parts per thousand (Protoreaster sp.). For five of the six groups of benthic macroinvertebrates, seagrass and their epiphytes contributed more than 69.4%. For 14 of the 17 fish species, seagrass and their epiphytes are the main contributors. For 15 of the 17 fishes, the trophic levels inferred from SIA are lower than those from the previously reported diet composition analysis. These findings show that seagrass and their epiphytes are consumed by most of the fish and benthic macroinvertebrates, and are important for a large portion of the food web in seagrass meadows in the Coral Triangle area.

AB  - Mullet populations are abundant in littoral waters throughout the world and play a significant role in organic matter fluxes. Mullets are opportunistic feeders: adults have frequently been shown to feed on primary producers (e.g. fresh or detrital plant material, microphytobenthos) but they may also feed on meiofauna. The population structure and stomach contents of mullets that colonize saltmarsh creeks in Aiguillon Bay (French Atlantic coast) were studied to determine if they use saltmarshes as a feeding ground in spring. Stable isotope analyses were carried out on mullets sampled to assess their diet during their spring migration. The mullet population was primarily composed of young-of-the-year (G0), 1 year-old (G1) of both Liza ramada and Liza aurata species and 3 year-old or older (G3+) L ramada individuals. G0 and G3+ population densities increased during the spring period: catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased from 0.22 to 1.49 ind min(-1) for the GO age group; but stomach content analyses revealed that only G1 and G3+ feed in the saltmarsh. Isotopic signatures of G1 (spring: delta(13)C: -14.8 parts per thousand delta(15)N: 14.1 parts per thousand) and G3+ mullets (spring: delta(13)C: -16.9 parts per thousand, delta(15)N: 13.8 parts per thousand) indicate that mullet growth is supported largely by primary consumers, such as benthic meiofauna or small macrofauna. Mullets are thus positioned at a much higher trophic level than true primary consumers. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mangrove soils are complex systems that are strongly influenced by biological activity Bioturbation may be considered as all interactions between animals, plants and soil material that are capable of altering soil structure and processes In mangrove soils, bioturbation by plants and crabs may shift physicochemical conditions thus affecting elements that are sensitive to redox variations, particularly iron and sulfur As a result, the dynamics of these elements may be altered and the concentrations may increase or decrease in both the interstitial water and solid phases This chapter consists of a brief overview of the different ways in which bioturbation (by both crabs and plants) may affect the total concentration and geochemistry of different forms of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in a Brazilian mangrove system To evaluate the effects of bioturbation by plants, iron and sulfur species were compared in unvegetated and vegetated substrates colonized by Spartina and Rhizophora However, to obtain information about how bioturbation caused by crab activity affects Fe and S geochemistry, seasonal sampling was carried out in the unvegetated sediment Total organic carbon (TOC) and total S were analyzed in the solid phase, along with acid volatile sulfide (AVS), iron partitioning, root biomass and percentage of sand The results demonstrate the important role of bioturbation in Fe and S geochemistry The activities of plant roots appear to operate in opposite directions, by promoting both oxidation and synthesis of iron sulfides Oxidation and aeration by root structures generated a more acidic and oxidative environment within superficial layers, where there was a higher density of live roots In contrast, in deeper layers, and underneath zones with a large belowground biomass, root exudates appeared to intensify pyrite synthesis by stimulating the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria Crab burrowing also substantially affected the biogeochemical cycles of S and Fe Crabs affected the redox equilibrium of unvegetated sediments by constructing channels and burrowing, which intensified O-2 diffusion and pyrite oxidation in the summer Bioturbation may therefore be a key factor in the geochemical behavior of Fe and S in mangrove environments, and may affect the partitioning of reduced and oxidized forms of these elements, as well as the processes involved in organic matter decomposition

AB  - Rates of microbial iron reduction and other pathways of organic carbon (C-org) oxidation were investigated in sediment from a 100-m deep site in Lake Michigan. Total benthic mineralization rates of 6.8 and 8.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, were determined from benthic flux measurements and by summation of dissolved inorganic carbon (SigmaCO(2)) accumulation rates measured in anoxic incubations of sediment in discrete depth intervals to 18 cm depth. Carbon oxidation rates were highest near the sediment surface and decreased asymptotically toward zero. A C-org half-life of 0.06 yr was estimated in the oxic zone, but the half-life increased by more than two orders of magnitude in the deep anoxic layers. Mineralization in the oxic zone (0-2.1 cm) accounted for 37% of the total SigmaCO(2) production, whereas microbial iron reduction was the most important pathway of carbon oxidation, accounting for 44%; sulfate reduction accounted for 19%, and methanogenesis was negligible. Denitrification accounted for <3% of C-org oxidation. Sulfate reduction was suppressed in the upper 5 cm, where oxygen, manganese, and iron reduction prevailed. Below this zone, sulfate reduction peaked but coexisted with microbial iron reduction. All Mn reduction was apparently coupled to iron and sulfide oxidation in the upper 6 cm. Below that level, a transient accumulation of iron monosulfide and pyrite implied that sulfate reduction increased during the 19th century because of anthropogenic atmospheric sulfur deposition. Sediment mixing through bioturbation was crucial for the cycling of Mn, Fe, and S, and estimates of biodiffusion coefficients were 0.02-0.3 cm(2) d(-1).

AB  - Methane concentrations can be high in coastal groundwater, resulting in methane export driven by submarine groundwater discharge. However, the magnitude of this methane flux depends significantly on the rate of methanotrophy, the often overlooked process of microbial methane consumption that occurs within coastal aquifer sediments. Here we describe a zone of methanogenesis within the freshwater lens of a barrier island aquifer and investigate the methane source/sink behavior of the barrier island system as a whole. The median concentration of methane dissolved in fresh groundwater beneath the center of the island was 0.6 mM, supported by high rates of potential methanogenesis (22 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). However, rates of microbial methane consumption were also elevated in surrounding sediments (18 mmol m(-2) day(-1)). Groundwater flowing from the zone of methanogenesis to the point of discharge into the ocean had a long residence time within methanotrophic sediments (similar to 195 days) such that the majority of the methane produced within the barrier island aquifer was likely consumed there.

AB  - A sediment core from Guanabara Bay (Brazil) was analyzed for Pb-210 dating, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen, carbon stable isotope ratio (delta C-13), nitrogen stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) and the metals Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Pb, V and Zn, to assess the influence of land use changes on the aquatic system in a region for which large industrial and urban development is expected in the next few decades. To obtain baseline data for improving the monitoring of the expected increase in anthropogenic impacts from surrounding drainage basins, a multivariate analysis of data from different sediment layers was carried out to evaluate the dated sediment record. The geochemical data suggested three different sedimentary phases along the last 200 years. Before the 1880s, the highest clay and TOC contents were observed, where the C/N ratios and the delta C-13 values suggested a mixture of algal and terrestrial organic matter and the lowest concentrations of Co, Cu, Pb, V and Zn, for which background levels were estimated (4.6, 2.7, 14.9, 24.3 and 70.2 mg kg(-1), respectively). From the 1880s to the 1950s, the metal concentrations and sand particles increased, but no change in organic matter quality was observed, reflecting a period of land use change, still without significant sewage input. After the 1950s, the sedimentation rate increased from 0.42 to 0.77 cm year(-1) and increasing urban sewage input was evidenced by lower C/N ratios, higher delta N-15, decrease of Fe and Mn concentrations and increased fluxes of metals and TOC, which showed a good relationship with population growth data.

AB  - Flow-through flumes were used to quantify net areal fluxes of nutrients in the fringe mangrove zone of lower Taylor River in the southern Everglades National Park. We also quantified net areal fluxes along the open water portion of the channel to determine the relative importance of either zone (vegetated vs. unvegetated) in the regulation of nutrient exchange in this system. Taylor River's hydrology is driven mainly by precipitation and wind, as there is little influence of tide. Therefore, quarterly samplings of the vegetated and unvegetated flumes were slated to include typical wet season and dry season periods, as well as between seasons, over a duration of two years. Concentrations of dissolved and total organic carbon (DOC and TOC) were highest during the wet season and similar to one another throughout the study, reflecting the low particulate loads in this creek. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (nitrate+nitrite+ammonium) was 10-15% of the total nitrogen (TN) content, with NOx- and NH4+ showing similar concentration ranges over the 2-year study. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was usually <0.05 <mu>M, while total phosphorus (TP) was typically an order of magnitude higher. Net areal fluxes were calculated from nutrient concentration change over the length of the flumes. Most flux occurred in the vegetated zone. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and DOC were usually taken up from the water column; however, we saw no seasonal pattern for any constituent over the course of this study. Total nutrients (TOC, TN, and TP) showed little net exchange and, like SRP, had fluxes that shifted irregularly throughout the study. Despite the lack of a clear seasonal pattern, there was a great deal of consistency between vegetated flumes, especially for NOx- and NH4+ and fluxes in the vegetated flumes were generally in the same direction (import, export, or no net flux) during a given sampling. These findings suggest that the fringe mangrove zone is of considerable importance in regulating nutrient dynamics in lower Taylor River. Furthermore, the influence of this zone may at times extend into northeast Florida Bay, as the bay is the primary recipient of water and nutrients during the wet season. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - This work presents a novel approach to assessing the impact of future growth in rural regions faced with rapid growth. We investigate one of the most rural counties on the eastern coast of the U.S. (McIntosh County, Georgia) from the dual perspective of (1) ecosystem services and (2) costs assumed by local government. As land cover in our focal locality is overwhelmingly forest or wetland, we compiled estimates from multiple sources to map the value per ha/year of (1) timber sales and recreational leases to private landowners and (2) a suite of non-market public amenities: rare species habitat, carbon sequestration, flood control, pollution treatment, water supply, and storm protection. We then quantified, based on county budgets, expenditures and revenues deriving from major land use categories (residential, commercial/industrial, agricultural/open-space). Results indicate that (1) forested wetlands generate relatively little revenue to either private landowners or in taxes to the county from extractive uses, but have very high value relative other land cover types in the provision of ecosystem services, (2) forest lands contribute much more in revenue than they receive in services, whereas residential properties cost more in services, than they generate in revenue, and (3) significant gains in both ecosystem service preservation, hazard reduction, and in lower costs to the county in municipal services could be achieved by restricting new development from within the Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)-determined 500 year floodplain.

AB  - In order to understand natural sea-level variability, and to enhance future predictions, accurate and precise estimates of Holocene tidal levels are required. Although the application of diatom-based transfer functions can yield such data, these work best when underpinned by local training sets. Urbanized estuaries offer little prospect of obtaining local training sets and, instead, the reliability of regional transfer functions has to be assessed. The performance of a published regional (UK) diatom-based tidal-level transfer function applied to fossil assemblages from two contrasting core sites in the Mersey Estuary, UK, is assessed using modern analogue techniques and sediment isotope data. We find that, although estimated tidal levels coincide with changes in organic matter source, the frequent lack of modern analogues mean that palaeotide estimates are without basis. This is likely a consequence of the site-specific nature of diatom assemblages in higher intertidal and supratidal areas in particular, where local factors are expected to exert a greater control on their ecology. This situation may be partly resolved by constructing and applying much larger regional training sets from multiple higher intertidal and supratidal sites (where intact). Otherwise the application of alternative techniques, such as regional foraminiferal tidal-level transfer functions, may be more appropriate. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this study, the sediment profiles of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratios, total phosphorus, N/P ratios, C/P ratios, particle sizes, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used to investigate natural and anthropogenic impacts on Lake Chaohu over the past 100 years. Before 1960, Lake Chaohu experienced low productivity and a relatively steady and low nutrient input. The increasing concentration and fluxes of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, together with changes in the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of organic material in the sediment cores, suggested that the anthropogenic effects on trophic status first started because of an increase in nutrient input caused by a population increase in the drainage area. With the construction of the Chaohu Dam, an increase in the utilization of fertilizer and the population growth which occurred since 1960, stable depositional conditions and increasing nutrient input resulted in a dominantly algae-derived organic matter source and high productivity. Nutrient input increased most significantly around 1980 following the rapidly growing population, with concomitant urbanization, industrial and agricultural development. This study also revealed that the concentration and distribution of nutrients varied between different areas of sediment within Lake Chaohu because of the influence of different drainage basins and pollution sources.

AB  - Embryonic exposures to the components of petroleum, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), cause a characteristic suite of developmental defects and cardiotoxicity in a variety of fish species. We exposed zebrafish embryos to reference sediment mixed with laboratory weathered South Louisiana crude oil and to sediment collected from an oiled site in Barataria Bay, Louisiana in December 2010. Laboratory oiled sediment exposures caused a reproducible set of developmental malformations in zebrafish embryos including yolk sac and pericardial edema, craniofacial and spinal defects, and tissue degeneration. Dose-response studies with spiked sediment showed that total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (tPAH) concentrations of 27 mg tPAH/kg (dry weight normalized to 1 percent organic carbon [1 percent OC]) caused a significant increase in defects, and concentrations above 78 mg tPAH/kg 1 percent OC caused nearly complete embryo mortality. No toxicity was observed in Barataria sediment with 2 mg tPAH/kg 1 percent OC. Laboratory aging of spiked sediment at 4 degrees C resulted in a nearly 10-fold decrease in sensitivity over a 40-day period. This study demonstrates oiled sediment as an exposure pathway to fish with dose-dependent effects on embryogenesis that are consistent with PAH mechanisms of developmental toxicity. The results have implications for effects on estuarine fish from oiled coastal areas during the Deepwater Horizon spill. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Wetlands play a crucial role in reducing global warming potential in response to global climate change. Largescale reclamation and artificial restoration of coastal wetlands significantly affect the greenhouse gas methane emissions of coastal ecosystems. To comprehensively understand the difference in methane emissions between natural and reclamation-restored wetlands, the natural bare mudflat (BM - bare mudflat) in Hangzhou Bay, three types of natural vegetation wetlands (SM - Scirpus mariqueter, PA - Phragmites australis, and SA - Spartina alterniflora), and four types of reclamation-restored P. australis wetlands with different water levels (RW0 - Water level at 0 cm; RW10 - Water level at 10 cm; RW20 - Water level at 20 cm; RW30 - Water level at 30 cm) were selected to analyze the relationship between methane emissions and environmental factors through field observations and laboratory experiments. The results showed that the methane emission flux and methane production potential (MPP) of reclamation-restored wetlands were notably higher than those of natural wetlands, and the monthly dynamics in the different types of wetlands were consistent with temperature. The methane emission flux increased rapidly from April to July (summer), and reached a monotonic peak in July. Among the natural wetlands, the methane emission flux and MPP of SA were significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the soil organic carbon (SOC). In the reclamation-restored wetlands, the methane emission fluxes did not significantly differ between RW10, RW20, and RW30, but were remarkably higher than those of RW0 and natural wetlands, which was mainly driven by the water level and salinity. The differences in the MPP of the different soil layers were mainly affected by the SOC and water levels. Especially in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer of the reclamation-restored wetlands, the MPP was significantly higher, which was mainly driven by the SOC. Therefore, during the later stages of artificial reclamation-restored wetlands, appropriate water level and salinity management and other effective engineering measures should be explored to manage methane emissions during wetland restoration.

AB  - Study of distribution pattern of different sulphur fraction's along the Kerala coast shows that sulphur diagenesis was active in clay and silt dominated sediments. Storage of sulphur to sediments In this coast was found to be in the organic form. Reducing environment induced by the high content of organic matter is considered to be the major factor which controls the distribution of different S species. Significant concentrations of AVS-S and other reduced S species clearly supports the presence of a reducing environment in the sediments of Kerala Coast.

AB  - Evaluations of tidal wetland restoration efforts suffer from a lack of appropriate reference sites and standardized methods among projects. To help address these issues, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) and the NOAA Restoration Center engaged in a partnership to monitor ecological responses and evaluate 17 tidal wetland restoration projects associated with five reserves. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the level of restoration achieved at each project using the restoration performance index (RPI), which compares change in parameters over time between reference and restoration sites, (2) compare hydrologic and excavation restoration projects using the RPI, (3) identify key indicator parameters for assessing restoration effectiveness, and (4) evaluate the value of the NERRS as reference sites for local restoration projects. We found that the RPI, modified for this study, was an effective tool for evaluating relative differences in restoration performance; most projects achieved an intermediate level of restoration from 2008 to 2010, and two sites became very similar to their paired reference sites, indicating that the restoration efforts were highly effective. There were no differences in RPI scores between hydrologic and excavation restoration project types. Two abiotic parameters (marsh platform elevation and groundwater level) were significantly correlated with vegetation community structure and thus can potentially influence restoration performance. Our results highlight the value of the NERRS as reference sites for assessing tidal wetland restoration projects and provide improved guidance for scientists and restoration practitioners by highlighting the RPI as a trajectory analysis tool and identifying key monitoring parameters.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) as an essential macronutrient, plays a crucial role in the regulation of biological productivity and biogeochemical cycling of other biogenic elements in aquatic environments. Different geochemical fractions of sedimentary P were separated and quantified using the sequential extraction (SEDEX) method to evaluate the abundance, sources, distribution, bioavailability and ecological risk of P in surface sediments of the Cross River estuary system (CRES) and adjacent shelf. Sediment grain size composition and bulk organic carbon were also determined. Total P (TP) ranged from 9.21-18.2 mu mol/g (average, 13.30 +/- 2.08 mu mol/g), and comprised mostly of inorganic P (IP) (IP/TP = similar to 87%). Generally, authigenic P (Ca-P) was the dominant IP fraction (Ca-P/IP = similar to 37 +/- 11.1%), representing an important long-term P reservoir. The range of organic carbon (OC) to organic P (OP) ratio (OC/OP) indicated the predominance of terrestrial OC, and that leachable OP (Le-OP) may be the major OP form in surface sediments of the study area. The partitioning and distribution of different sedimentary P fractions were controlled by the biogeo- and physicochemical conditions favorable for P transformation, sediment grain size composition and sources of sedimentary organic matter. The ratio (Fe/P) of the extractable Fe in citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate solution (Fe-CDB) to ferric oxide-bound P(Fe-P) revealed the presence of reactive Fe- matrices having strong sorption capacity for P. The contents of potential bioavailable P (BAP) (similar to 34-60% of TP) indicated that P amount in the overlying water column may increase substantially if released from surface sediments. The Fe-P was the major component of BAP, and the relationship between BAP and extractable Fe-CDB highlighted the significant impact of Fe(III) (oxyhdr)oxides on P mobility and bioavailability. The estimated P enrichment index (PEI) indicated that surface sediment is less impacted by anthropogenic P and poses less ecological risk with respect to sedimentary TP load in the study area.

AB  - Zebra mussels are now a major component of the benthos in the tidal freshwater Hudson River. Their filtering activity has had a wide range of ecosystem-level effects. Zebra mussel biodeposits (feces and pseudofeces) were sampled in in situ chambers containing mussels attached to artificial substrates. The biodeposits collected were analyzed for organic matter (OM), chlorophyll-a, phaeopigments, C, N, bacterial cell densities, and bacterial production rates. Relative to control sediments (sediments passively collecting in the chambers), biodeposits were significantly enriched in all measures except bacterial cell densities. Biodeposits were estimated to contain 9.5 % OM and 3.9 % live algae by weight, while values in passive deposits were 7.8 % and 1.1 %, respectively. The C:N ratio of biodeposits was estimated at 8.3, and bacterial production was estimated at 14.6 x 10(7) cells gOM(-1) h(-1), while passive deposit values were 9.8 and 7.4 x 10(7) cells gOM(-1) h(-1), respectively. When subjected to a range of mixing energies, biodeposit mixtures (feces, pseudofeces and passive deposits) were resuspended at a bed stress that was approximately 50 % lower than the bed stress required to resuspend the passive deposits. Although biodeposits were shown to be enriched in the above measures, their resuspension by water currents in a system like the tidal freshwater Hudson River will reduce their residence time at the river bottom, possibly reducing their ecological impact on the benthos.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) fractions and phosphatase activities were measured in 22 coastal wetland soils with typical vegetation successions in Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. P forms and phosphatase activities varied greatly from site to site even under the same vegetation cover. NH4Cl-P, bicarbonate/dithionite extracted P and NaOH-P were remarkably higher (p < 0.05) in soils With exotic invasive plants, Spartina alterniflora, than in soils with the native species Suaeda salsa, Scirpus mango etc and Phragmites australis. HCl-P and refractory P showed little variation. No significant differences were detected for either alkaline phosphatase (ALAP) or acid phosphatase (ACAP) among the soils. All of the above properties were much higher in soils with plant growth compared to bare flat soils. Regression analysis demonstrated that organic matter (OM), Al, Ca, Fe and total P (TP) were able to explain more than 70% of the variations in the P fractions (except 29% of NH4Cl-P), and OM was the most important contributing factor. ALAP and ACAP were irrelevant to P but were significantly related to TOC, suggesting that carbon was a limiting factor for P mineralization in this area. Owing to its huge biomass and densities, Spartina alterniflora displayed great potential for carbon input, thus facilitating P mineralization and cycling. The results enhance our understanding of P availability differences in this area covered by invasive and native vegetation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enhanced anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) have disturbed their biogeochemical cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The N and S cycles interact with one another through competition for labile forms of organic carbon between nitrate-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, the N and S cycles could interact through nitrate (NO3-) reduction coupled to S oxidation, consuming NO3-, and producing sulfate (SO42-). The research questions of this study were: (1) what are the environmental factors explaining variability in N and S biogeochemical reaction rates in a wide range of surficial aquatic sediments when NO3- and SO42- are present separately or simultaneously, (2) how the N and S cycles could interact through S oxidation coupled to NO3- reduction, and (3) what is the extent of sulfate reduction inhibition by nitrate, and vice versa. The N and S biogeochemical reaction rates were measured on intact surface sediment slices using flow-through reactors. The two terminal electron acceptors NO3- and SO42- were added either separately or simultaneously and NO3- and SO42- reduction rates as well as NO3- reduction linked to S oxidation were determined. We used redundancy analysis, to assess how environmental variables were related to these rates. Our analysis showed that overlying water pH and salinity were two dominant environmental factors that explain 58% of the variance in the N and S biogeochemical reaction rates when NO3- and SO42- were both present. When NO3- and SO42- were added separately, however, sediment N content in addition to pH and salinity accounted for 62% of total variance of the biogeochemical reaction rates. The SO42- addition had little effect on NO3- reduction; neither did the NO3- addition inhibit SO42- reduction. The presence of NO3- led to SO42- production most likely due to the oxidation of sulfur. Our observations suggest that metal-bound S, instead of free sulfide produced by SO42- reduction, was responsible for the S oxidation.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems host high levels of primary productivity leading to exceptionally dynamic elemental cycling in both water and sediments. In such environments, carbon is rapidly cycled leading to high rates of burial as organic matter and/or high rates of loss to the atmosphere and laterally to the coastal ocean in simpler forms, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To better understand carbon cycling across these heterogeneous environments, new technologies beyond discrete sample collection and analysis are needed to characterize spatial and temporal variability. Here, we describe the ChemYak, an autonomous surface vehicle outfitted with a suite of in situ sensors, developed to achieve large spatial scale chemical mapping of these environments. Dissolved methane and carbon dioxide are measured by a laser spectrometer coupled to a gas extraction unit for continuous quantification during operation. The gas-powered vehicle is capable of rapidly surveying the coastal system with an endurance of up to 10 h at operating speeds in excess of 10 km h(-1). Here, we demonstrate its ability to spatially characterize distributions of CO2, CH4, oxygen, and nitrate throughout a New England saltmarsh estuary.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the food web pathways supporting juvenile Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in the Columbia River estuary through multiple stable isotope analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34). Using this method, we distinguished the role of various organic matter sources in Chinook food webs and interpreted the dynamics of their use both spatially and temporally within the estuary. Our results indicate that subyearling Chinook are associated with fluvial, anthropogenic, estuarine, and marine organic matter sources, with hatchery food and vascular plant detritus being the most dominant sources in juvenile Chinook food webs. Although freshwater phytoplankton is involved in many food web pathways to subyearling Chinook, increased phytoplankton production from the impounded river has not replaced the loss of autochthonous marsh production to fish. Our results indicate that large-scale ecosystem alteration may have decreased the availability and quality of food webs in the estuary and potentially diminished the ability of the Columbia to support Chinook salmon.

AB  - Wetlands provide significant ecosystem services yet are ranked among some of the most imperiled habitats. To maximize prioritization of these habitats a better understanding of the full range of ecosystem functions is needed, starting with an examination of how coastal wetlands have been portrayed in restoration literature to date. This study consists of a literature review and the use of automated topic analyses aimed at (1) summarizing the current research related to coastal wetland restoration, (2) identifying the key fields of research, and (3) identifying research efforts connecting restoration and climate adaptation strategies (e.g. blue carbon). Of the 702 papers sourced for this analysis, most studies were conducted in North America and Europe. An increase in articles considering wetland restoration was found from 1985 to October 2020, with 40% of the research published just in the last triennia (2018-2020). Topic division highlights the emergence of studies related to management under climate change (e.g. sea level rise, adaptive management) and to carbon sequestration as separate fields of research from classical ecological studies. This reveals the need to ensure that classical ecological research is not neglected by work relating to climate strategies, which depend upon an accurate understanding of ecological processes.

AB  - Ratios of C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14 were measured in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG), marginal vegetation, benthic macrodetritus (diameter >1 mm) and selected invertebrate consumers in the Gamtoos estuary, South Africa to: (1) trace the provenance of benthic detrital deposits, and (2) determine the extent to which three abundant species of macroinvertebrates utilise this resource. DIC was strongly depleted in C-13 with average parts per thousand(13)C values (-9.5+/-0.5 parts per thousand) being typical of limnetic waters. Benthic detrital particles (delta(13)C -24.1+/-0.3 parts per thousand) originated mainly from marginal vegetation (delta(13)C -25.7+/-0.3 parts per thousand), but their slightly elevated carbon ratio suggests additional input from C-13-rich sources - possibly C-4 plants cultivated on the floodplain. Populations of the fossorial ghost shrimp Callianassa kraussi, the bentho-pelagic amphipod Grandidierella lignorum and the epifaunal crab Hymenosoma orbiculare together account for 96% of total benthic biomass in the upper regions of this estuary. Marked differences in trophic niches were evident among these three consumer species. Ghost shrimp (delta(13)C -32.5+/-0.3 parts per thousand) foraged by filter-feeding on fine suspended particulate organic matter (delta(13)C -31.2+/-0.5 parts per thousand). Amphipods (delta(13)C -28.0+/-0.6 parts per thousand) utilised some benthic detritus but fed mainly on suspended material. Only the relatively rare crabs (delta(13)C -23.8+/-1.5 parts per thousand) appeared to utilise benthic detrital particles to any significant extent. in the benthic consumer community of the upper Gamtoos estuary, suspension feeders make up 98% of biomass and thus clearly dominate over deposit feeders. This can be traced to the low contribution of higher plants (c. 13%) to overall carbon production, and detritus originating from macrophytes is consequently relatively unimportant in supporting invertebrate secondary production in this particular system.

AB  - Concentrations and fluxes of C, N, and P were measured in dwarf and fringe mangrove wetlands along the Taylor River, Florida, USA from 1996 to 1998. Data from these studies revealed considerable spatial and temporal variability. Concentrations of C, N, and P in the dwarf wetland showed seasonal trends, while water source was better at explaining concentrations in the fringe wetland. The total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) content of both wetlands was higher during the wet season or when water was flowing to the south (Everglades source). Concentrations of nitrate plus nitrite (NOx-), ammonium (NH4+), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the fringe wetland were all highest during the dry season or northerly flow (bay source). Nutrient concentrations most effectively explained patterns of flux in both wetlands. Increased wetland uptake of a given constituent was usually a function of its availability in the Water column. However, the release of NOx- from the dwarf wetland was related to the NH4+ concentration, suggesting a nitrification signal. Nitrogen flux in the dwarf wetland was also related to surface water salinity and temperature. Our findings indicate that freshwater Everglades marshes are an important source of dissolved organic matter to these wetlands, while Florida Bay may be a source of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Our data also suggest that temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations (as driven by season and water source) influence patterns of materials flux in this mangrove wetland. Applying long-term water quality data to the relationships we extracted from these flux data, we estimated that TN and TP were imported by the dwarf wetland 87 +/- 10 and 48 +/- 17% of the year, respectively. With Everglades restoration, modifications in freshwater delivery may have considerable effects on the exchanges of nutrients and organic matter in these transitional mangrove wetlands.

AB  - Recent (1964-1989) rates of peat accretion and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and organic carbon (C) accumulation were measured in Everglades soils to characterize the effects of altered hydroperiod and nutrient regimes on the nutrient storage capacity of the Everglades ecosystem. Peat accretion was related to hydroperiod and phosphorus loading. Accretion rates were highest in areas of extended hydroperiod (2.8-3.2 mm/yr) and/or phosphorus enrichment (4.0 mm/yr) and lowest in areas of reduced hydroperiod (1.6-2.0 mm/yr). Rates of accumulation of nitrogen were 3.8-11.6 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 8.2 g.M-2-yr-1) and those of organic C were 54-161 g-m-2.yr-1 (chiBAR = 104 g.M-2.yr-1). Accumulation rates of N and organic C were primarily a function of peat accretion rates. Phosphorus accumulation was controlled by both peat accretion and increased soil P content. Soil P concentrations (1248 mug/g) in an area receiving N and P enriched agricultural runoff were 2-3 times higher than P levels at unenriched locations (432-764 mug/g). As a result, rates of P accumulation at this site (0.46 g.m-2.yr-1) were 2-8 times greater compared to unenriched Everglades soils (0.06-0.23 g.m-2-yr-1). Inputs of P (0.53 g.M-2. yr-1) and N (15.5 g.m-2-yr-1) to the nutrient-enriched area of Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A (via rainfall and surface flow) were nine and twelve times higher than inputs to the unenriched part of WCA 2A. As a result, the efficiency of P removal was lower at the enriched site (87%) than at the unenriched location (100%). Nitrogen removal efficiencies also were lower in the enriched area (75%) as compared to the unenriched area, where N accumulation in peat was 290-450% of the input. The difference in N storage efficiencies between the two sites may reflect differences in N fixation and denitrification in nutrient-enriched and unenriched Everglades peatlands. Our findings suggest that nutrient-enriched agricultural drainage has contributed to increased rates of peat accretion and phosphorus accumulation in areas of the northern Everglades that have been receiving agricultural drainage for the past 25-30 yr. The affected area has functioned effectively as a phosphorus sink, primarily due to increased organic P storage. However, the effects of nutrient loading, especially P, on the long-term stability of the Everglades ecosystem and on the long-term P storage potential of Everglades peats are poorly understood and are currently under investigation.

AB  - Whole air drawn from four heights within the high elevation (3,340 m asl), deep, winter snowpack at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were sampled into stainless steel canisters, and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography for 51 volatile inorganic and organic gases. Two adjacent plots with similar snow cover were sampled, one over bare soil and a second one from within a snow-filled chamber where Tedlar/Teflon-film covered the ground and isolated it from the soil. This comparison allowed for studying effects from processes in the snowpack itself versus soil influences on the gas concentrations and fluxes within and through the snowpack. Samples were also collected from ambient air above the snow surface for comparison with the snowpack air. Analyzed gas species were found to exhibit three different kinds of behavior: (1) One group of gases, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), chloroform (CHCl3), dimethylsulfide (CH3)(2)S, carbondisulfide (CS2), and dichlorobromomethane (CHBrCl2), displayed higher concentrations inside the snow, indicating a formation of these species and release into the atmosphere. (2) A second group of compounds, including carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS), the hydrocarbons methane, ethane, ethyne, benzene, and the halogenated compounds methylchloride (CH3Cl), methylbromide (CH3Br), dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromoform (CHBr3), tetrachloromethane (CCl4), CFC-11, CFC-12, HCFC-22, CFC-113, 1,2-dichloroethane, methylchloroform, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b, were found at lower concentrations in the snow, indicating that the snow and/or soil constitute a sink for these gases. (3) For 21 other gases absolute concentrations, respectively concentration gradients, were too low to unequivocally identify their uptake or release behavior. For gases listed in the first two groups, concentration gradients were incorporated into a snowpack gas diffusion model to derive preliminary estimates of fluxes at the snow-atmosphere interface. The snowpack gradient flux technique was found to offer a highly sensitive method for the study of these surface gas exchanges. Microbial activities below this deep, winter snowpack appear to be the driving mechanism behind these gas sources and sinks. Flux results were applied to a simple box model to assess the potential contribution of the snowpack uptake rates to atmospheric lifetimes of these species.

AB  - We introduced tracer levels of N-15-enriched nitrate into the oligohaline reach of the Parker River estuary (Massachusetts, USA) to study the transformation and fate of watershed-derived nitrogen during the biologically productive summer period. Intensive temporal and spatial measurements were made of the isotopic label in a wide range of organisms during the N-15 amendment and for 2 mo thereafter. The tracer helped determine the relative trophic importance of three major sources of organic nitrogen supporting the food web of the upper Parker River estuary: planktonic and benthic primary producers, and detritus derived mostly from the surrounding marsh. The planktonic centric diatom Actinocyclus normanii was the primary vector of tracer nitrogen to benthic and water-column organisms. Fauna that attained the highest N-15-tracer content (planktonic copepods, planktivorous juvenile fishes, several macrofaunal crustaceans) derived a major part of their incorporated nitrogen (similar to 50% or more) from the bloom-forming planktonic diatom through consumption of freshly produced cells and deposited diatom detritus, or through processing of diatoms by. an herbivorous intermediary. Of the nitrogen incorporated by intertidal sedimentary biota (pennate diatoms, harpacticoid copepods, oligochaetes), benthivorous fishes (mummichog, white sucker), and sand shrimp, 10-30% derived from planktonic diatoms, often through a delayed remineralization and re-incorporation loop. Fauna that assimilated little label (spionid polychaete, anthurid isopod, American eel) obtained >90% of their nitrogen from a pathway based on plant detritus, or from older, nonlabeled diatom detritus. Assimilation and remineralization by benthic organisms of nitrogen incorporated in A. normanii demonstrated an unexpectedly strong linkage of water-column and benthic production. Benthic organisms continued to show tracer enrichment up to 2 mo after the end of tracer addition, indicating that deposited planktonic diatoms constituted a benthic food and nitrogen reserve. The N-15-tracer illuminated food web pathways and revealed the speed with which nitrogen moves through this estuarine ecosystem.

AB  - Species of ascomycetes are the principal microbial secondary producers in standing-decaying shoots of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), the foremost and highly productive grass of saltmarshes of the eastern USA. Rates of expulsion of ascospores from wet, standing-decaying leaves of S. alterniflora were measured in spore-capture chambers seasonally, over a 3-year period. Extents of occupation of decaying leaves were determined by measuring sizes of characteristic patches associated with different species or species groups. Patches of leaf blades not occupied by at least one of the ascomycetes of the smooth-cordgrass ascomycete community occupied less than 0.2% of leaf abaxial area. Patches of the 'black-peppered' appearance (containing ascomata of one or more of the following: Phaeosphaeria spartinicola, Mycosphaerella sp. 2, Phaeosphaeria halima) occupied 91 to 98% of abaxial leaf area for mid-shoot blades at subsites containing tall and intermediate-height shoots. At short-shoot sites, 'peppered' patches occupied 53% of leaf area, due to higher levels of periwinkle grazing at short-shoot sites; size of 'peppered' patches was negatively correlated with extent of severe invertebrate grazing of leaves (r = -0.87). Blackened patches (containing ascomata of Buergenerula spartinae) had an overall average occupation percentage of 17% of leaf area, and the percentage was not significantly affected by periwinkle grazing (, = -0.13). Attached decaying leaf blades low on shoots and leaf sheaths expelled few spores (< 30% of the average for mid-shoot and upper-shoot blades), and for sheaths, B. spartinae was apparently the principal ascomycete releasing spores. For mid-shoot and upper-shoot decaying blades, mean total ascospore-expulsion rate ranged from 14 to 131 spores mm(-2) leaf abaxial surface (72 h)(-1), depending on marsh watershed and season. Higher percentages of expelled ascospores for Phaeosphaeria spartinicola were found for autumn and winter (52 to 62%, of spores), but for Mycosphaerella sp. 2, peak seasons were summer and spring (42 to 54% of spores). Percentages of ascospores for these two species were uniform over years, marsh watersheds, and tall- to short-shoot marsh subsites, whereas Phaeosphaeria halima exhibited a high degree of spatiotemporal patchiness. Because the ascospore-capture method used does not measure total ascospore release, only minimum values could be calculated for ascospore output m(-2) marsh. Calculated minimum rates of total ascospore expulsion for mid-shoot plus upper-shoot blades were 1.3 million spores m(-2) marsh h(-1) of blade wetness, 5.9 billion spores m(-2) organic mass m(-2) yr(-1), and 7.5 g organic mass m(-2) yr(-1) , amounting to 4.5%, of total annual fungal production within these blades.

AB  - The interactions of mussel aquaculture with physico-chemical properties and the biogenic elemental composition of the surface sediment were studied at a long-line farm, located in a 12 km(2) area, which included the farm (4 km(2)) characterized by relevant freshwater inputs along the North-Western Adriatic coastline. Negative redox potentials were detected at two stations directly affected by the farm. Total phosphorus content reached the highest concentration at stations located beneath the farm. OC/TP and TN/TP showed similar patterns, which was characterized by average values underneath the farm (respectively 45.5 and 4.5) that were significantly lower than those measured at the control stations. Our hypothesis, that these patterns could be related to organic matter enrichment of the surface sediment underneath the farm, due to intense mussel biodeposition, was confirmed by the mass accumulation rates, estimated to be respectively 23, 2.3, 0.94 and 0.26 g m(-2) y(-1) for organic carbon, total nitrogen, total and organic phosphorus. Data concerning the sediment chemistry were normalized with respect to the pelite fraction thus increasing the capability of detecting the environmental impact of the farm under variable background sedimentary fluxes.

AB  - Tidal flats are being used to understand sea level changes, pollution history, and depositional environment.. From the part of the long-term study, distribution of sediment components organic carbon, total phosphorus, and selected elements (Fe, Mn, and Cr) are used in this paper to understand diagenetic processes and hydrodynamic processes involved during the deposition of sediment. The present study revealed that the sediment components, organic carbon, and phosphorus play an important role in controlling the distribution and concentration of elements. Importance of the oxic-anoxic layer in the distribution and concentration of metals are discussed. Hydrodynamic conditions of the sediments deposited are delineated using triangular diagram.

AB  - Estimates of global wetland area range from 5.3 to 12.8 million km(2). About half the global wetland area has been lost, but an international treaty (the 1971 Ramsar Convention) has helped 144 nations protect the most significant remaining wetlands. Because most nations lack wetland inventories, changes in the quantity and quality of the world's wetlands cannot be tracked adequately. Despite the likelihood that remaining wetlands occupy less than 9% of the earth's land area, they contribute more to annually renewable ecosystem services than their small area implies. Biodiversity support, water quality improvement, flood abatement, and carbon sequestration are key functions that are impaired when wetlands are lost or degraded. Restoration techniques are improving, although the recovery of lost biodiversity is challenged by invasive species, which thrive under disturbance and displace natives. Not all damages to wetlands are reversible, but it is not always clear how much can be retained through restoration. Hence, we recommend adaptive approaches in which alternative techniques are tested at large scales in actual restoration sites.

AB  - Minerals are the building blocks of clastic sediments and play an important role with respect to the physico-chemical properties of the sediment and the lithostratigraphy of sediments. This paper aims to provide an overview of the mineralogy (including solid organic matter) of sediments as well as suspended matter as found in the Netherlands (and some parts of Belgium). The work is based on a review of the scientific literature published over more than 100 years. Cenozoic sediments are addressed together with suspended matter and recent sediments of the surface water systems because they form a geoscientific continuum from material subject to transport via recently settled to aged material. Most attention is paid to heavy minerals, clay minerals, feldspars, Ca carbonates, reactive Fe minerals (oxides, siderite, sulphides, glauconite) and solid organic matter because they represent the dominant minerals and their properties form a main issue in subsurface and water management. When possible and relevant, the amounts, provenance, relationship with grain size distribution, early diagenesis and palaeohydrological evolution are described. Tables with statistical data about the mineral contents and isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter are presented as overviews. The review on the mineralogy of Dutch fluvial and marine environments is more extensive than that for the other sedimentary environments because the first two have been studied much more intensively than the others and they also form the larger part of the Dutch deposits. The focus is on the natural background mineralogy of Dutch sediments, but this is hard for recent sediments, largely because the massive hydraulic infrastructure present in the Netherlands has probably also affected the mineralogy and geochemistry of sediments deposited in recent centuries. Many findings are summarised, several of which lead to more general insights for the Dutch situation. Ca carbonates in sediments often have several provenances and thus must be considered as mixtures. Dolomite is commonly present in addition to calcite. The importance of biotite as weatherable mica is unclear. Weathering of heavy minerals plays some role but it is unclear in which way it affects the heavy mineral associations. Clays are usually dominated by illite, smectite and their interstratified variant, while kaolinite is usually below 20% and chlorite below 5%. Vermiculite is a minor constituent in fluvial clays and its illitisation presumably happens during early diagenesis in the marine environment. Opaque Fe hydroxides can be present in addition to Fe oxyhydroxide coatings and both will play a role in redox chemistry as reactive Fe minerals. Feldspars in marine sediments must be present but they have not been properly studied. The genesis of rattle stones and carbonate concretions has not been completely elucidated. The fraction of terrigeneous organic matter in estuarine and coastal marine sediments is substantial. The available data and information are spread irregularly over the country and the reviewed information discussed in this paper is derived from relatively small-scale studies dealing with a limited amount of analysed samples. Much information is available from the Scheldt estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands partly due to the severe contamination of the Western Scheldt in recent decades.

AB  - Patterns of long-distance spread of invasive plants via wind and water have been proposed and simulated. Spartina alterniflora can be seen anywhere along the Chinese coastline but its naturally spreading patterns remain unclear. Given the linearity between delta C-13 abundance in sediment and colonizing time of S. alterniflora, a C4 plant, we used organic delta C-13 abundance in surface sediment from the well-developed patches to understand its spread pattern in seven invaded estuaries along the Fujian coastline, including two intentionally introduced estuaries. delta C-13 abundance (%.) in sediments from the seven invaded estuaries were 21.2 +/- 0.8, 20.3 +/- 0.5, 20.7 +/- 1.0, 23.5 +/- 0.4, 22.4 +/- 0.5, 23.2 +/- 0.7, and 22.1 +/- 0.9, respectively, from north to south. Luoyuan and Feiluan estuaries with the intentional plantings had significantly greater delta C-13 abundances than other invaded estuaries. Significant correlations of delta C-13 abundance with electric conductivity (positive) and particle size (negative) (p < 0.01, n=113) in sediments from the seven estuaries indicate the invasion success sequence of S. alterniflora. Taiwan Straits' northward alongshore surface current, switching to southward in winter, might play a crucial role in dispersing seeds of S. alterniflora among estuaries along the Fujian coast. In comparison with the two intentionally planted estuaries, Yacheng estuary showed a clear delta C-13 pattern that declined from seaside to inner estuary. It suggests that a natural invasion at intra-estuary scale with seeds transported by the alongshore surface currents from the two intentional planted estuaries or the upper province. Variations of delta C-13 abundance among the naturally invaded estuaries suggest that other factors might regulate niche availability for S. alterniflora invasion success, such as discharges and sediment topographic features. Moreover, a linear relationship was discovered between delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundances in invaded sediments, suggesting that microbially mediated nitrogen removal processes might prevail and result in N-15 enrichment due to habitat modification by S. alterniflora invasion.

AB  - Gulf sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi is listed as 'threatened' under the US Endangered Species Act throughout its range in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA, as the recognized break between eastern and western populations. Population recovery requires protection of the species and its critical habitat. We examined Gulf sturgeon physical habitat attributes and infaunal macrobenthic prey density and composition both spatially and seasonally relative to acoustically tagged Gulf sturgeon occurrence in the Pascagoula River estuary. Gulf sturgeon occupancy patterns indicated that adults move quickly through the system during fall and spring compared to longer but more spatially and temporally variable occupancy for juveniles and sub-adults in both seasons; sub-adults exhibited a less spatially and temporally variable occupancy pattern. We found significant differences in physical habitat and macrobenthic density characteristics that partially explained Gulf sturgeon spatial and temporal occupancy patterns. Direct comparisons of physical drivers (% silt, depth, particulate organic carbon) and macrobenthic density patterns (BEST procedures) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) but weak (global R = 0.277) and suggest alternate hypotheses to better explain the differential estuarine habitat use patterns. The most parsimonious explanation with multiple weights-of-evidence suggests reduced use of the eastern distributary habitat by Gulf sturgeon based on synergistic effects of urbanization and industrialization such as bulkheading, channelization, dredging and related maintenance activities, and beach re-nourishment, all of which occur almost exclusively in the east zone of the estuary.

AB  - We examined high frequency fluctuations in water quality parameters in two tropical coastal plain estuaries in response to changing tidal flow conditions. The variability in total suspended sediments (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, and indicators of water quality, including pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, over one spring tidal cycle during the early wet monsoon season was measured in two estuaries in eastern Sumatra. The relatively high rainfall experienced throughout the year, in combination with the recent extensive vegetation clearing and modification of the landscape, resulted in significant concentrations of TSS, VSS, and TOC being discharged to coastal waters. Maximum values are reached on the ebb tide (TSS > 1,013 mg l(-1); VSS > 800 mg l(-1); TOC > 60 mg l(-1)). The influence of freshwater discharge and tidal flow on water properties of the lower estuaries is also marked by the variability in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH over the tidal cycle, with minimum values for each of these parameters following maximum current velocities and after the completion of the strong ebb tide. Estimation of seaward sediment fluxes, which are of significant interest in a region where rapid environmental change is occurring, would require further examination of sedimentary processes, such as resuspension and advection of sediment, as well as a consideration of neap-spring tidal variations and the effect of seasonality on estuarine circulation.

AB  - We examined the use of delta C-13, TOC and C/N geochemistry of sedimentary organic matter to reconstruct former sea levels and paleoenvironments in the absence of suitable microfossil data. The modern distribution of delta C-13, TOC and C/N of 33 vegetation and 74 surface sediment samples collected from four coastal wetlands in the Thames Estuary and Norfolk, UK are described. The d13C, TOC and C/N geochemistry of sediments varied in relation to the input of in situ vascular vegetation versus allochthonous particulate organic matter and algae, which was controlled primarily by tidal inundation. We reviewed published and unpublished studies to produce an English database of vegetation (n = 257) and sediment (n = 132) delta C-13, TOC and C/N geochemistry. Four elevation-dependent environments in the database had statistically distinct delta C-13, TOC and C/N values: (1) tidal flat/low marsh (delta C-13: -24.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand; TOC: 3.6 +/- 1.7%; C/N: 9.9 +/- 0.8); (2) middle marsh/high (delta C-13: -26.2 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand; TOC: 9.8 +/- 6.7%; C/N: 12.1 +/- 1.8); (3) reed swamp (d13C: -27.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand: TOC: 36.5 +/- 11.5%; C/N: 13.9 +/- 1.2); and (4) fen carr (d13C: -29.0 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand; TOC: 41.6 +/- 5.7%; C/N: 17.4 +/- 3.1). The d13C, TOC and C/N geochemistry database was applied to a Holocene sediment core collected from the Thames Estuary to produce three new sea-level index points and one limiting date, illustrating the utility of d13C, TOC and C/N values to reconstruct Holocene relative sea levels.

AB  - Land cover patterns were evaluated in 29 estuarine watersheds of South Carolina to determine relationships between urban/suburban development and estuarine habitat quality. Principal components analysis and Pearson product moment correlation analyses were used to examine the relationships between ten land cover categories and selected measures of nutrient or bacterial enrichment in the water column and contaminant enrichment in sediments. These analyses indicated strong relationships between land cover categories representing upland development and a composite measure of 24 inorganic and organic contaminants using the Effect Range Median-Quotient (ERM-Q). Similar relationships also were observed for the summed concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, and metals. Data obtained from tidal creeks generally showed stronger correlations between urban/ suburban land use and pesticides and metals compared to data obtained from larger open water habitats. Correlations between PAH concentrations and the urban/suburban land cover categories were similar between creek and open water habitats. PCB concentrations generally showed very little relationship to any of the land cover categories. Measures of nutrient enrichment, which included total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate-nitrite, phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, and total organic carbon, were generally not significantly correlated with any land cover categories, whereas fecal coliform bacteria were significantly and positively correlated with the urban/suburban land cover categories and negatively correlated with the non-urban land cover categories. Fecal coliform correlations were stronger using data from the open water sites than from the tidal creek sites. Both ERM-Q and fecal coliform concentrations were much greater and more pervasive in watersheds with relatively high (> 50%) urban/suburban cover compared to watersheds with low (< 30%) urban/suburban cover. These analyses support the hypotheses that estuarine habitat quality reflects upland development patterns at large spatial scales, and that upland urbanization can result in increased risk of biological degradation and reduced safe human use of South Carolina's coastal resources.

AB  - Mangroves are important for coastal protection, carbon sequestration and habitat provision for plants and animals in the tropics and subtropics. Mangroves are threatened by habitat destruction and sea level rise, but management activities such as impounding for mosquito control can also have negative effects. We studied the effects of Rotational Impoundment Management (RIM) on nitrogen dynamics in impoundments dominated by three types of Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) stands along the Indian River Lagoon (Florida). RIM, designed for noxious insect control, involves pumping estuarine water into impoundments in this area during spring and summer to raise water levels by 30 cm. We compared aspects of the nitrogen cycle before and after the start of the RIM and measured the same variables in an impoundment without RIM management.
   RIM led to the accumulation of ammonium in the substrate which coincided with a lowering of nitrification rates and decreased denitrification rates. Salt pan habitats dominated by dwarf mangroves became less saline following RIM initiation. Shoot growth of mangroves increased in response to higher nitrogen availability and lower pore water salinity. Mangrove responses were greatest in areas with dwarf and sparse mangrove cover. Overall, RIM resulted in lower nitrification and denitrification leading to lower nitrogen losses and increased Black mangrove growth, all benefits of RIM beyond those associated with noxious insect control.

AB  - As bivalve aquaculture expands worldwide, an understanding of its role in nutrient cycling is necessary to ensure ecological sustainability and determine the potential of using bivalves for nutrient mitigation. Whereas several studies, primarily of epifaunal bivalves, have assessed denitrification, few have considered nutrient regeneration processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which competes with denitrification for nitrate and results in nitrogen retention rather than loss. This study compares sediment nitrogen cycling including mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification within U.S. clam aquaculture sediments to nearby uncultivated sediments, seasonally. Clam aquaculture significantly increased sediment ammonium and phosphate effluxes relative to uncultivated sediments. Both DNRA and denitrification were significantly enhanced at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments in July and November, while in May only DNRA was increased. The ratio of DNRA to denitrification was significantly higher at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments, demonstrating that DNRA may be favored due to a ready supply of labile organic carbon relative to nitrate and perhaps sulfidic conditions. Functional gene abundances, nrfA (DNRA) and nirS (denitrification) followed similar patterns to nitrate respiration rates with highest nrfA abundances in the clam sediments and similar nirS abundances across seasons and sediment type. Ultimately clam sediments were found to be a significant source of nutrients to the water column whereas uncultivated sediments retained ammonium produced by microbial mineralization. Thus, clam cultivation may promote local eutrophication (i.e., increased primary production) by facilitating nutrient regeneration and retention of ammonium in the sediments.

AB  - In this chapter, the significance of meiobenthic fauna as consumers in benthic systems is elucidated in a number of coastal locations (down to 200 m) representing a range of environmental and ecological conditions in different coastal zones and biogeographical regions. Food preferences, feeding strategies, and diet spectra are also reviewed across various feeding guilds and taxonomic groups. In addition, by condensing estimates of meiofaunal trophic interactions with other benthic components, a quantitative role of meiobenthos in carbon transfer and energy flows from organic matter sources to higher consumers in food web is assessed.

AB  - Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) was introduced to China in December 1979 to buffer against fides and to accelerate coastal wetland accretion. Since then, its propagation and natural dispersal have allowed this exotic plant to rapidly expand throughout coastal China with generally negative ecological effects. In 2003 S. alterniflora was labeled as an invasive plant in China, and it now covers similar to 50,000 ha. In this review, we first summarize the mechanisms of spread and spatial distribution of S. alterniflora, and how its physiological characteristics and strong adaptability to the available niche space in China's wetlands have enabled its spread and competition with native plants. Then we review the effects of S. alterniflora on ecosystem function in terms of habitat conversion and the alteration of biodiversity, soil carbon flux and sequestration, and various processes of nutrient regulation. We conclude that we need a long-term and context-dependent perspective, in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of S. alterniflora within each of China's unique provinces.

AB  - Changes in land use will alter soil profiles of wetlands under climatic change and human disturbance, especially through grasslandification. Grasslandification is the process where a wetland is drained and converted to pasture. Grasslandificationon on the Tibetan plateau has been intensive over the last 40 years, mostly from drainage by humans. However, many previous studies have generally analysed only wetland ecological processes, despite the fact that grasslandificaiton, the biggest change process on the Tibetan plateau, has resulted from social and economic stresses. The assessment of changes to the soil C, N and P by grasslandification is the key to understanding the contribution to carbon management from alpine wetlands and variation of soil nutrition. We experimentally investigated the effect of grasslandification on soil physical (water, pH and EC) and chemical profiles (C, N and P) in grasslandification-pasture plots and reference wetland plots based on previous remote sensing results of the Maqu alpine wetland on the Tibetan plateau. The grasslandification process of alpine wetlands reduced vegetation quality and increased degree of drought, especially relevant with heavy grazing of the pasture. In general, grasslandification reduced the C, N and P content of soils and increased pH and EC, all significantly associated with variation to the vegetation and soil water. Soil C has changed more than N, P with grasslandification, but the soil C: N: P ratio has been relatively stable, and grasslandification has lead the wetland to the habitat with nitrogen limited. Thus, the grasslandification process of alpine wetlands on the Tibetan plateau over the last 40 years has increased net carbon emissions from alpine wetland soil contributions to atmospheric CO2. The grasslandification of alpine wetland is a drying process and observed changes were mainly influenced by variations of soil water and nutrients. Maintaining vegetation and soil water is an important approach to mitigating soil degradation and carbon emissions from alpine wetlands. In consideration of the current social and economic status of the study site, it is difficult to return or restore the grasslandification area to the original wetland, so the better strategy is to protect the existing wetland and reduce the human disturbance.

AB  - We studied the distribution of dissolved O-2, CO2, CH4, and N2O in a coastal swamp system in Thailand with the goal to characterize the dynamics of these gases within the system. The gas concentrations varied spatially and seasonally in both surface and ground waters. The entire system was a strong source for CO2 and CH4, and a possible sink for atmospheric N2O. Seasonal variation in precipitation primarily regulated the redox conditions in the system. However, distributions of CO2, CH4, and N2O in the river that received swamp waters were not always in agreement with redox conditions indicated by dissolved O-2 concentrations. Sulfate production through pyrite oxidation occurred in the swamp with thin peat layer under aerobic conditions and was reflected by elevated SO42-/Cl- in the river water. When SO42-/Cl- was high, CO2 and CH4 concentrations decreased, whereas the N2O concentration increased. The excess SO42- in the river water was thus identified as a potential indicator for gas dynamics in this coastal swamp system.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) in wetlands is mainly bound to sediment in various species, which is essential to predict water column P levels. The purpose of this work is to understand the influences of sediment properties and vegetation types on P speciation. Sediments under four vegetation types in the tidal flat and offshore sandbar in Hangzhou Bay of China were collected seasonally. The rank order of P species in sediment based on concentration was exchangeable P (Exch-P)<iron/aluminum-bound P (Fe/Al-P)<organic P (Org-P)<calcium-bound P (Ca-P). Sediment total phosphorus (TP) and Fe/Al-P concentrations were lower in offshore sandbar than those of tidal flat, reflecting effects of anthropogenic contamination in the latter. Sediment particle size distribution strongly affected P speciation, as indicated by a significant correlation between them. Total phosphorus and Org-P concentrations in vegetated sediments were higher than those of bare mudflat. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between Ca-P and Org-P, and Fe/Al-P, indicating the presence of vegetation which may result in P speciation by converting Ca-P to soluble and active P and higher Org-P. Overall, sediment particle size distribution is the most fundamental physical property that affects P speciation, and vegetation types are important factors that influence Org-P concentration.

AB  - Wetlands, especially in the Mediterranean area, are subject to severe eutrophication. This may upset the equilibrium between phytoplankton production in undesirable quantities and a quantitatively desirable macrophyte production. In order to manage this equilibrium, a quantitative knowledge of nutrient input and fluxes is essential and the role of sediments in these processes must be understood. This knowledge can be useful even for agriculture, e.g. rice cultivation, where optimal utilization of fertilizers can lead to an economic benefit.
   In this article different aspects of nutrient cycles are discussed in view of approaching a sufficiently precise quantification. The nutrient input balance of the Camargue was therefore measured which showed that the input of nutrients with the irrigation water, taken from the river Rhone, roughly equals the quantity of fertilizers added.
   Phytoplankton growth can be approached reasonably with the Monod model, although there are still many practical problems, such as the influence of the pH on P uptake and the problem of measuring P uptake in the field. The situation is worse for macrophyte growth; quantitative data are scarce and studies have often been carried out with unrealistic nutrient concentrations or without addressing the influence of the sediment. This influence can also include negative factors, such as high concentrations of Fe2+, H2S or FeS, but cannot yet be quantified.
   The nitrogen cycle in wetlands is dominated by denitrification. Most wetlands have sediments with high concentrations of organic matter, therefore with a large reducing capacity. Besides this process, we have shown that denitrification can also be controlled by FeS. In the Camargue sediments this denitrification is mediated by bacteria from the sulfur cycle; this appeared to be the major pathway. It was shown that a stoicheiometric relation exists between nitrate reduced and sulphate produced. The influence of the temperature was quantified and appeared to be stronger at high organic matter concentrations than at lower ones. Denitrification with FeS means that the bacteria use nitrate also for their N demands, while this is not necessarily the case during denitrification with organic matter.
   Mineralization of macrophytes is a much slower process than that of phytoplankton, probably because of their high C/N ratio. We could, however, not confirm the general assumption that the addition of nitrogen stimulates this mineralization. On the contrary, we found that two amino acids both with a C/N ratio of 6 had different mineralization rates. The amino acid composition of dead macrophytes and the C/N ratio may be of equal importance.
   Unlike nitrogen, phosphate is always strongly adsorbed onto sediments. The two mechanisms of the adsorption of inorganic phosphate onto sediments, i.e. the adsorption onto Fe(OOH) and the precipitation of apatite, have been quantified. The adsorption of phosphate onto Fe(OOH) can be satisfactorily described with the Freundlich adsorption isotherm: P-ads = A*(o-P)(B). The adsorption coefficient A depends on the pH of the system and the Ca2+ concentration of the overlying water and can be quantified preliminarily by A = a.10((-0.416*pH)).(2.86 - (1.86.e(-Ca2+))). B can be approached by 0.333, which means the cube root of the phosphate concentration. The second mechanism is the solubility of apatite. We found a solubility product of 10(-50) for hard waters. The two mechanisms are combined in solubility diagrams which describe equilibrium situations for specific lakes.
   The conversion of Fe(OOH) to FeS has a strong influence on phosphate adsorption, although the partial reduction of Fe(OOH) approximate to P by H2S does not release significant quantities of phosphate. Even after complete conversion to FeS only a small part of the bound phosphate was released.
   Besides the two inorganic phosphate compounds, we established the existence of two organic pools, one soluble after extraction with strong acid (ASOP), the other one with strong alkali. The first pool is probably humic bound phosphate, while the larger part of the second pool was phytate. The ASOP was remineralized during the desiccation of a Camargue marsh; this drying up oxidized FeS, thus improving the phosphate adsorption and decreasing the denitrification capacity. It can, therefore, be an important tool for management. The phytate was strongly adsorbed onto Fe(OOH), which explains the non-bioavailability towards bacteria.
   The fact that the sediment phosphate concentration can be approached by multiplying the relevant sediment adsorption constant with 3 root o-P concentration has the consequence that much larger quantities of phosphate accumulate in the sediments than in the overlying water. This means that even if the phosphate input is stopped, the eutrophication will only be reversed very slowly, and not at all, if the shallow waters in wetlands have no through flow - as is often the case in many marshes in Mediterranean wetlands.

AB  - A continuous field research effort has been carried out in the Apalachicola River estuary since March 1972. The information generated from this interdisciplinary study has been directly applied to the management of the Apalachicola resource by means of close associations among local, state, and federal officials and university scientists. During the early years, scientific data were instrumental in the prevention of the impoundment of the Apalachicola River. A series of regional studies was carried out to evaluate various forms of effects due to forestry activities, pesticides, and stormwater runoff from urban areas. A review was made of fisheries problems associated with dredging, overfishing, and marine pollution. Results of such studies were directly applied to local management questions. Research that linked the river wetlands with the estuary, in terms of the input of fresh water, nutrients, and organic matter, served as the basis for the purchase of extensive bottomland tracts. Other initiatives were carried out that were designed to protect the naturally high productivity of the river estuary. Further purchases of estuarine wetlands and barrier island properties were made that formed an almost continuous buffer of publicly held lands between upland developments and critical habitats and important populations of the bay system. A regional management plan was adopted that was designed to limit local municipal development in the estuarine region.
   Analyses of the long-term scientific data indicated that dominant, commercially important estuarine populations are associated with river flow, local salinity characteristics, and biological (predation, competition) interactions with the salinity regime and food web structure. Such interactions are not straight forward, however; they reflect complex interactions of the freshwater influxes and biological response in the estuary that are not well understood. Species-specific responses to the principal driving factors further complicate the biological relationships of the Apalachicola system. The management of a river-dominated estuary should be based on protection and control of freshwater sources, nutrients, and organic matter with a minimization of physical alterations that often lead to increased salinity stratification and the associated loss of the nursery function of the estuary. There is growing evidence that changes in upland characteristics and within-system habitat alterations are associated with changes in nutrient distributions and salinity relationships and that such changes can have serious impacts on estuarine systems. Issues involving basic changes in estuarine productivity and associated food webs are far more important than those involving species diversity in the management of such resources. Processes such as nutrient flow and salinity alteration underlie the very basis of estuarine productivity and usefulness.
   Over the past decade, there has been a gradual reduction in the importance of research as an integral part of the planning and management process in the Apalachicola system. This regional trend follows a national pattern. Dredging effects on the river and bay have gone on without effective challenge even though such activities are damaging productive habitats of the system. The once influential Apalachicola oyster fishery remains in disarray following a series of natural disasters and poor management practices. There is a growing problem with the deliberate obstruction of the generation and use of scientific data to determine management policies by various state and federal agencies. The substitution of public relations activities for the development of needed scientific information concerning factors such as the importance of sustained freshwater input to estuaries is further evidence that even the most elaborate and well-conceived management plans can be reversed by political manipulations and short-sighted bureaucratic policies.

AB  - Invasion by Spartina alterniflora seriously threatens native ecosystem along Chinese coast. Determining the main influential factors and their relationships with the distribution of S. alterniflora is thus crucial for invasion control. However, the distribution is influenced by environmental variables at different scales and the relative importance of cross-scale variables is unclear. Based on the MaxEnt modelling technique, a combined regional environmental niche (CREN) model was built by integrating the global climate niche (GCN) model into the regional environment niche (REN) model to study the combined effects of global climate suitability and regional environmental variables on species distribution. The CREN model performed much better than the GCN model with AUC, TSS, specificity and sensitivity values increasing by 0.12, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.45, whereas it performed as well as the REN model, but reduced the overfitting. When considering the combined effects, the predicted suitable area decreased from 66.90% at the global scale to 18.53% at the regional scale. Global sensitivity analysis showed there were strong interactions among different variables, especially for elevation and global climate suitability, the most influential variables. Interactions reduced the importance of soil salinity, but enhanced that of soil percentage sand. The presence probability increased with increasing of global climate suitability and soil salinity, while decreased with increasing of elevation, soil organic carbon and percentage sand. The presence probability was the highest in moderately well drained and lowest in poorly drained soil. Ignoring the combined effects of cross-scale variables will prevent comprehensive elucidation of their relationship with species distribution, which should be considered to take effective measures against biological invasion.

AB  - The mobility and plant availability of many trace and toxic metals in wetland soils is often substantially different from upland soils. Oxidation-reduction (redox) and associated pH changes that occur in soils as a result of flooding or drainage can affect the retention and release of metals by clay minerals, organic matter, iron oxides, and, for coastal wetlands, sulfides. Except where a flooded soil or sediment becomes strongly acid upon drainage and oxidation, as sometimes occurs, the processes immobilizing metals tend to be complimentary such that large-scale metal releases from contaminated soils and sediments do not occur with changing redox conditions. Metals tend to be retained more strongly in wetland soils compared with upland soils.

AB  - Mangrove forests have survived a number of catastrophic climate events since first appearing along the shores of the Tethys Sea during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The existence of mangrove peat deposits worldwide attests to past episodes of local and regional extinction, primarily in response to abrupt, rapid rises in sea level. Occupying a harsh margin between land and sea, most mangrove plants and associated organisms are predisposed to be either resilient or resistant to most environmental change. Based on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts, mangrove forests along arid coasts, in subsiding river deltas, and on many islands are predicted to decline in area, structural complexity, and/or in functionality, but mangroves will continue to expand polewards. It is highly likely that they will survive into the foreseeable future as sea level, global temperatures, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.

AB  - We mapped tidal wetland gross primary production (GPP) with unprecedented detail for multiple wetland types across the continental United States (CONUS) at 16-day intervals for the years 2000-2019. To accomplish this task, we developed the spatially explicit Blue Carbon (BC) model, which combined tidal wetland cover and field-based eddy covariance tower data into a single Bayesian framework, and used a super computer network and remote sensing imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Enhanced Vegetation Index). We found a strong fit between the BC model and eddy covariance data from 10 different towers (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.001, root-mean-square error = 1.22 g C/m(2)/day, average error was 7% with a mean bias of nearly zero). When compared with NASA's MOD17 GPP product, which uses a generalized terrestrial algorithm, the BC model reduced error by approximately half (MOD17 had r(2) = 0.45, p < 0.001, root-mean-square error of 3.38 g C/m(2)/day, average error of 15%). The BC model also included mixed pixels in areas not covered by MOD17, which comprised approximately 16.8% of CONUS tidal wetland GPP. Results showed that across CONUS between 2000 and 2019, the average daily GPP per m(2) was 4.32 +/- 2.45 g C/m(2)/day. The total annual GPP for the CONUS was 39.65 +/- 0.89 Tg C/year. GPP for the Gulf Coast was nearly double that of the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts combined. Louisiana alone accounted for 15.78 +/- 0.75 Tg C/year, with its Atchafalaya/Vermillion Bay basin at 4.72 +/- 0.14 Tg C/year. The BC model provides a robust platform for integrating data from disparate sources and exploring regional trends in GPP across tidal wetlands.

AB  - Tidal flats provide valuable ecosystem services such as flood protection and carbon sequestration. Erosion and accretion processes govern the ecogeomorphic evolution of intertidal ecosystems (marshes and bare flats) and, hence, substantially affect their valuable ecosystem services. To understand the intertidal ecosystem development, high-frequency bed-level change data are thus needed. However, such datasets are scarce due to the lack of suitable methods that do not involve excessive labour and/or costly instruments. By applying newly developed surface elevation dynamics (SED) sensors, we obtained unique high-resolution daily bed-level change datasets in the period 2013-2017 from 10 marsh-mudflat sites situated in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United Kingdom in contrasting physical and biological settings. At each site, multiple sensors were deployed for 9-20 months to ensure sufficient spatial and temporal coverage of highly variable bed-level change processes. The bed-level change data are provided with synchronized hydrodynamic data, i.e. water level, wave height, tidal current velocity, medium sediment grain size (D-50), and chlorophyll a level at four sites. This dataset has revealed diverse spatial morphodynamics patterns over daily to seasonal scales, which are valuable to theoretical and model development. On the daily scale, this dataset is particularly instructive, as it includes a number of storm events, the response to which can be detected in the bed-level change observations. Such data are rare but useful to study tidal flat response to highly energetic conditions.
   The dataset is available from 4TU.ResearchData (https://doi.org/10.4121/12693254.v4; Hu et al., 2020), which is expected to expand with additional SED sensor data from ongoing and planned surveys.

AB  - We examined the contemporaneous responses of N2 fixation and denitrification to inorganic nitrogen-enriched runoff in 2 intertidal microbial mats in Tomales Bay (California, USA). Prior to runoff, N2 fixation rates averaged 3 mmol N m-2 d-1. Denitrification rates were lower, corresponding to 0 to 25 % of N2 fixation rates. After the initiation of runoff, N2 fixation rates decreased, approaching zero at both sites. In contrast, denitrification rates increased by an order of magnitude. We developed a simple model to examine the magnitude of N removal from creek water by mat denitrification before, during and after runoff. Model results show that during peak runoff, N removal was limited by the residence time of creek water in the intertidal region. As runoff volumes decreased and residence times increased, N removal became limited by the supply of organic matter. Our results illustrated the rapid metabolic adaptation of microbial mats to altered N fluxes. Changes occurring in the mat N cycling after the initiation of runoff led to 2 fundamental ecological changes: (1) mats became sinks for rather than sources of fixed N and (2) denitrification became limited by the availability of organic carbon rather than nitrate.

AB  - Along the past century, the Arabian Gulf has experienced a continuous and fast coastal development leading to increase the human pressures on the marine environment. The present study attempts to describe the historical changes of trace elements in the sediments of vegetated coastal habitats in the western Arabian Gulf. Pb-210-dated sediment cores collected from seagrass, mangrove and saltmarsh habitats were analyzed to evaluate historical variations in concentrations and burial rates of 20 trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sr, V and Zn). The highest correlations (Spearman correlation coefficients >= 0.51) were found between crustal elements (Al, Fe, Co, Cr, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Ni, V, and P), suggesting a common crustal source in the Gulf. The increased concentrations of these crustal elements in modern marine sediments of the Arabian Gulf seem to be linked to increased mineral dust deposition in the area. Over the last century, both elemental concentrations and burial rates increased by factors of 1-9 and 1-15, respectively, with a remarkably fast increase occurring in the past six decades (1960 - early 2000). This is most likely due to an increase in anthropogenic pressures along the Gulf coast.

AB  - Microtopography, or the small-scale variation in ground surface height (10(-1)-10(0) m) over short (10(0)-10(2) m) spatial scales, is a ubiquitous feature of wetlands globally. This variation in elevation, characterized by local high ("hummocks") and low ("hollows") patches, is more structured than what is observed in uplands, and is intertwined with concordantly structured spatiotemporal variability in hydrologic regimes and associated ecological processes. The importance of microtopography in wetlands is manifold, with critical influence on local hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes. Further, the creation and maintenance of wetland microtopography is a balance between activation processes (i.e., those that induce random elevation variation) and autogenic reinforcement processes (i.e., those that provide the feedbacks necessary for the persistence of microtopography). While there are many mechanisms that create vertical structure (e.g., tree falls, accumulation of roots and soil organic matter, and sediment deposition), they all yield a similar core feedback to enhance and sustain microtopographic structure. Finally, microtopography contributes to spatial patterning that confers emergent ecosystem-scale functions such as hydrologic storage and flows, carbon cycling, organism dispersal, and biodiversity. There is an ongoing need to study the origins and implications of this fine-scale variation in elevation, as well as the utility of including microtopography in model predictions and ecological restoration efforts.

AB  - The invasion by exotic cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has become one of the most serious and challenging environmental and ecological problems in coastal China because it can have adverse effects on local native species, thereby changing ecosystem processes, functions, and services. In this study, 300 surface sediments were collected from 15 stations in the Jiulong River Estuary, southeast China, across four different seasons, in order to reveal the spatiotemporal variability of biogenic elements and their influencing factors in the subtropical coastal mangrove wetland. The biogenic elements including carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (C, N, and S) were determined by an element analyzer, while the phosphorus (P) was determined by a flow injection analyzer. The concentrations of biogenic elements showed no significant differences among four seasons except total phosphorus (TP); however, our ANOVA analyses revealed a distinct spatial pattern which was closely related with the vegetation type and tidal level. Values of total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the surface sediment of mangrove vegetation zones were higher than those in the cordgrass and mudflat zones. The concentrations of TC, TN, TP, and total sulfur (TS) in the high tidal zones were higher than those in the middle and low tidal zones. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that tidal level, vegetation type, and season had some significant influence on the distribution of biogenic elements in the Jiulong River Estuary, by explaining 18.2, 7.7, and 4.9 % of total variation in the four biogenic elements, respectively. In conclusion, S. alterniflora invasion had substantial effects on the distributions of biogenic elements in the subtropical coastal wetland. If regional changes in the Jiulong River Estuary are to persist and much of the mangrove vegetation was to be replaced by cordgrass, there would be significant decreases on the overall storage of C and N in this coastal zone. Therefore, the native mangrove reforestation and exotic cordgrass elimination should be a priority in mangrove sustainable management for coastal ecosystem health.

AB  - The coastal zone, a highly dynamic and complex environment, has important ecological and jurisdictional implications for governments and coastal managers. Based on the CORINE Land Cover classification system, this paper examined the effects of land use and land cover change (LULC) on the coastlines' dynamics along the similar to 24 km barrier island of Nador lagoon on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco during a period of 62 years (1954-2016). The study utilized high-resolution orthoimages in the geographic information system (GIS) environment to characterize coastline evolution and LULC changes. The evolution of the coastline was assessed using a GIS tool, in particular the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The net rates of coastline change were calculated by using statistical methods: the End Point Rate (EPR) and the Linear Regression Rate (LRR). Results concerning the LULC changes showed that agricultural area and beach/dune classes decreased over the entire study period (62 years) by 11.14% and 28.45%, respectively. Urban fabric, shrub, forest, and saltmarsh/peat bog classes increased during the 62 years of evaluation by 2.69%, 19.92%, 16.77%, and 0.19%, respectively. Results regarding coastal analysis indicated that the accretion and erosion processes along the barrier island of the Nador lagoon (similar to 24km) were observed at 45% (10.6 km) and 55% (12.8 km) of the coastline, respectively. The beaches of Oulad Zehra and Oulad Aissa were characterized by erosion (-0.58 m/yr to -0.57 m/yr respectively), while accretion was observed on the beaches of Boukana and Kariat Arkmane at rates of +2.15 m/yr and +0.82 m/yr, respectively. This study highlighted that natural and anthropogenic processes have a strong influence on the erosion/accretion trends identified along the barrier island of Nador lagoon. The changes in LULC have affected the barrier island of the lagoon in two different forms: (1) a significant spatial conversion due to dune reforestation and (2) a fundamental spatial modification that affects the sea-lagoon connection (inlet) and the construction of new hard engineering structures.

AB  - The relationship between benthic diatom assemblages and environmental variables was analyzed in 40 sites at three estuaries from the northeastern coast of Argentina by using multivariate analyses. Surface sediment samples were collected along the estuarine gradient and analyzed for diatoms, organic matter, water content and grain size. Water salinity, pH, turbidity and temperature were measured seasonally at every sampling site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied in order to recognize which environmental variables correlated most closely with the distributions of diatom taxa. Salinity and sediment properties were identified as the most important variables influencing diatom distribution in the studied estuaries. A two-component Weighted-Averaging Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) calibration model was developed to infer salinity based on diatom assemblages. The reliability of the model was evaluated by the error of prediction (RMSEPj(ack-knifed) = 4.42 parts per thousand) and the correlation (r(jack-knifed)(2) = 0.75) between observed and diatom-inferred values. The transfer function was applied to fossil diatom assemblages recovered from a Holocene sequence from the Argentinean coast. The application of the model to the fossil record allowed quantitative inferences of salinity changes in southern South America, improving the quality of the inferences performed from diatom analysis.

AB  - This study was carried out to quantify the effects of higher organisms, invertebrate macrofauna, and macrophyte plants on the rates and pathways of microbial respiration coupled to organic matter oxidation in saltmarsh sediments. Sediment geochemistry, rates of microbial metabolism, and the abundance of anaerobic respiratory bacteria were determined at sites differing in the abundance of fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) burrows and vegetation (Spartina ulterniflora) coverage. Solid-phase Fe(III) concentrations were 50 to 100 times higher, and solid sulfide concentrations were eight times lower in bioturbated, vegetated sediments (BVL) as compared to nonbioturbated, unvegetated (NUC) sediments. Integrated sulfate reduction rates were 10 times lower in BVL (2 mmol m(-2) d(-2)) as compared to NUC sediments (20 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Directly measured Fe(III) reduction rates were high at the BVL site, whereas no Fe(III) reduction was detected at NUC or in killed sediment treatments. Molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reduction, inhibited 70% of carbon oxidation when added to NUC sediment but showed no effect on Fe(III) reduction or C oxidation in BVL sediments. Counts of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were two orders of magnitude higher in BVL sediments (10(7) cells g(-1)) in comparison to NUC sediments (10(5) cells g(-1)). Fe(III) respiration comprised up to 100% of carbon oxidation in BVL sediments, whereas sulfate reduction was the dominant respiration process (greater than or equal to70% of C oxidation) at NUC. We provide strong evidence to show that macroorganisms stimulate FeRB to outcompete sulfate-reducing bacteria in saltmarsh sediments by supplying an abundance of reactive Fe(III) through reoxidation processes.

AB  - We assessed the use of delta C-13, TOC and C/N values of bulk sedimentary organic matter (OM) to reconstruct paleoenvironmental and relative sea-level change from mangrove environments in Puerto Rico. The modern distribution of delta C-13, TOC and C/N values was described from 63 vegetation and 59 surface sediment samples collected from three sites containing basin and riverine mangrove stands, and was compared to microfossil (foraminiferal and thecamoebian) assemblages. Four vertically-zoned environments were identified: tidal flat (delta C-13: -18.6 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand; TOC: 10.2 +/- 5.7%; C/N: 12.7 +/- 3.1), mangrove (delta C-13: -26.4 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand; TOC: 33.9 +/- 13.4%; C/N: 24.3 +/- 6.2), brackish transition (delta C-13: -28.8 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand; TOC: 40.8 +/- 11.7%; C/N: 21.7 +/- 3.7), and freshwater swamp (delta C-13: -28.4 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand; TOC: 42.8 +/- 4.8%; C/N: 17.0 +/- 1.1). These environments had distinct delta C-13, TOC and C/N values, with the exception of the brackish transition and freshwater swamp zones that were difficult to distinguish on a geochemical basis alone. The foraminiferal assemblages were complicated by a group that did not show a relationship to elevation due to the presence of calcareous foraminifera occurring above mean higher high water (MHHW), likely resulting from washover or transport by storms. However, the ratio of foraminifera to thecamoebians (F/T) along with delta C-13, TOC and C/N values refines the distinction between brackish and freshwater environments. Using linear discriminant analysis, we applied the delta C-13, TOC, C/N and F/T distributions to a 1.7 m core containing a continuous sequence of Rhizophora mangle peat, which began accumulating at similar to 1650-1930 CE. Together, microfossils, delta C-13, TOC, and C/N values, and the core chronology from Cs-137 and radiocarbon dating revealed that sediments in the core likely accumulated in response to anthropogenic sediment delivery, making it unsuitable for relative sea-level reconstruction. We caution that in the absence of detailed litho-, bio-, chemo-, or chrono-stratigraphic analyses as presented here, care should be taken in interpreting sea-level histories derived from single dates on mangrove peats.

AB  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are ubiquitous anaerobic microorganisms that play significant roles in the global biogeochemical cycle. Coastal wetlands, one of the major habitats of SRB, exhibit high sulfate-reducing activity and thus play significant roles in organic carbon remineralization, benthic geochemical action, and plant-microbe interactions. Recent studies have provided credible evidence that the functional rather than the taxonomic composition of microbes responds more closely to environmental factors. Therefore, in this study, functional gene prediction based on PacBio single molecular real-time sequencing of 16S rDNA was applied to determine the sulfate-reducing and organic substrate-decomposing activities of SRB in the rhizospheres of two typical coastal wetland plants in North and South China: Zostera japonica and Scirpus mariqueter. To this end, some physicochemical characteristics of the sediments as well as the phylogenetic structure, community composition, diversity, and proportions of several functional genes of the SRB in the two plant rhizospheres were analyzed. The Z. japonica meadow had a higher dissimilatory sulfate reduction capability than the S. mariqueter-comprising saltmarsh, owing to its larger proportion of SRB in the microbial community, larger proportions of functional genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and the stronger ability of the SRB to degrade organic substrates completely. This study confirmed the feasibility of applying microbial community function prediction in research on the metabolic features of SRB, which will be helpful for gaining new knowledge of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of these bacteria in coastal wetlands.

AB  - Total organic carbon, C/N ratios of sediment organic matter and delta C-13 of sediment organic matter (delta C-13(org)) were measured as a function of depth at four sites in a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA during summer 2006. The goal of this study is to assess the sources of sediment organic matter at each site and to investigate the influence of macrophytes and macrofauna on the observed carbon isotopic signatures and C/N ratios at each site. The four sites include two adjacent creekside sites, one densely vegetated by tall-form Spartina alterniflora and the other mostly unvegetated, together with two adjacent sites higher in the marsh, including a site with sparse short-form Spartina and a neighboring site densely vegetated with Juncus roemarianus. Total organic carbon in the sediments of these sites varies between 2.1 and 6.4%, with the highest values observed at shallow depths at the unvegetated creek bank and the lowest at the short Spartina site. C/N ratios of the sediment organic matter vary between 10.6 and 17.3, with higher values at the short Spartina site compared to the other three sites. delta C-13(org) varies little with depth, averaging -20.1 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand at the Juncus, tall Spartina and adjacent unvegetated sites, and -17.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand at the short Spartina site. Mixing calculations completed with the depth-averaged C/N and delta C-13(org) for each site, assuming three endmember organic matter sources (C-3 plants, C-4 plants, phytoplankton), suggest that up to 75% of the organic matter at all four sites is derived from phytoplankton. Surprisingly, the average delta C-13(org) and C/N values, and therefore the calculated contributions of the three endmember organic matter sources to the total sediment organic matter, are very similar at the Juncus, tall Spartina and unvegetated creekbank sites. The greater delta C-13(org) and C/N of the short Spartina sediments is consistent with little or no inclusion of C-3-derived organic matter in the sediments at this site, in spite of the close proximity to the densely-vegetated Juncus site, and with less degradation of the organic matter compared to the other three sites.

AB  - The rapid expansion of construction related to coastal development evokes great concern about environmental risks. Recent attention has been focused mainly on factors related to the effects of water-logging, but there is urgent need to address the potential hazard caused by artificial topography: derived changes in the elemental composition of the sediments. To reveal possible mechanisms and to assess the environmental risks of artificial topography on transition of elemental composition in the sediment at adjoining zones, a nest-random effects-combined investigation was carried out around a semi-open seawall. The results implied great changes induced by artificial topography. Not only did artificial topography alter the sediment elemental composition at sites under the effect of artificial topography, but also caused a coupling pattern transition of elements S and Cd. The biogeochemical processes associated with S were also important, as suggested by cluster analysis. The geo-accumulation index shows that artificial topography triggered the accumulation of C, N, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb, As and Cd, and increased the pollution risk of C, N, 5, Cu, As and Cd. Enrichment factors reveal that artificial topography is a new type of human-activity-derived Cu contamination. The heavy metal Cu was notably promoted on both the geo-accumulation index and the enrichment factor under the influence of artificial topography. Further analysis showed that the Cu content in the sediment could be fitted using equations for Al and organic carbon, which represented clay mineral sedimentation and organic matter accumulation, respectively. Copper could be a reliable indicator of environmental degradation caused by artificial topography. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the Korean tidal flats in the Yellow Sea have been highlighted as a typical macrotidal system, so far, there have been no measurements of the sediment erodibility and critical shear stress for erosion (tau(ce)). Using the Gust erosion microcosm system, a series of field experiments has been conducted in the Ganghwa tidal flat to investigate quantitatively the effects of biogenic materials on the erodibility of intertidal cohesive sediments. Four representative sediment cores with different surficial conditions were analyzed to estimate the tau(ce) and eroded mass. Results show that tau(ce) of the "free" sediment bed not covered by any biogenic material on the Ganghwa tidal flat was in the range of 0.1-0.2 Pa, whereas the sediment bed partially covered by vegetation (Phragmites communis) or fecal pellets had enhanced tau(ce) up to 0.45-0.6 Pa. The physical presence of vegetation or fecal pellets contributed to protection of the sediment bed by blocking the turbulent energy. An inverse relationship between the organic matter included in the eroded mass and the applied shear stress was observed. This suggests that the organic matter enriched in a near-bed fluff layer is highly erodible, and the organic matter within the underlying sediment layer becomes depleted and less erodible with depth. Our study underlines the role of biogenic material in stabilizing the benthic sediment bed in the intertidal zone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Blue Carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses have been shown to sequester large amounts of carbon, and subsequently are receiving renewed interest from policy experts in light of climate change. Globally, seagrasses remain the most understudied of these ecosystems, with their total geographic extent largely unknown due to challenges in mapping dynamic coastal environments. As such, species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to identify areas of high suitability, in order to inform our understanding of where unmapped meadows may be located or to identify suitable sites for restoration and/or enhancement efforts. However, many SDMs parameterized to project seagrass distributions focus on physical and not anthropogenic variables (i.e., dredging, aquaculture), which can have negative impacts on seagrass meadows. Here we used verified datasets to identify the potential distribution of Zostera marina and Zostera noltei at a national level for the Republic of Ireland, using 19 environmental variables including both physical and anthropogenic. Using the Maximum Entropy method for developing the SDM, we estimated approximately 95 km(2) of suitable habitat for Z. marina and 70 km(2) for Z. noltei nationally with high accuracy metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.939 and 0.931, respectively for the two species. We found that bathymetry, maximum sea-surface temperature (SST) and minimum salinity were the most important environmental variables that explained the distribution of Z. marina and that high standard deviation of SST, mean SST and maximum salinity were the most important variables in explaining the distribution of Z. noltei. At a national level, we noted that it was primarily physical variables that determined the geographic distribution of seagrass, not anthropogenic variables. We unexpectedly modelled areas of high suitability in locations of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., dredging, high pollution risk), although this may be due to the binary nature of SDMs capturing presence-absence and not the size and condition of the meadows, suggesting a need for future research to explore the finer scale impacts of anthropogenic activity. Subsequently, this research should foster discussion for researchers and practitioners working on sustainability projects related to Blue Carbon.

AB  - The determination of optical properties of organic matter using spectroscopic techniques is a powerful tool for the characterization of humic substances (HS) in soils and sediments because of sensitivity, specificity and sample throughput. However, basic spectroscopic techniques have practical limitations because of the similarity in the optical properties of many HS. To improve resolution, the combination of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was applied for characterizing fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) fractions from soils and sediments of two estuarine environments in Spain. Five fluorescent components were identified by EEM-PARAFAC and were found in both FA and HA fractions, consistent with the new paradigm of HS as supramolecular associations as well as the ubiquity of the HS components in the environment. Their contribution was, however, different between the FA and HA fractions. Two different, humic-like, fluorescent components were representative of FA and HA fractions, respectively. The spectral characteristics of these components were similar to previously reported PARAFAC components in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a wide range of environments, suggesting their applicability in assessing OM quality and environmental dynamics. A microbial humic-like component was much more abundant in FA than in HA fractions. Furthermore, principal component analysis clarified that the two identified protein-like components, were enriched in sediment HA compared to soil HA, suggesting a larger contribution of refractory algaenan in sediment HA. The results of the present study demonstrate that EEM-PARAFAC is a useful technique for the biogeochemical characterization of soil and sedimentary HS.

AB  - The C:N and stable C isotope ratios (delta-C-13) of sedimentary and seston organic C (OC) were used to identify OC sources and sites of deposition in two large estuaries in North Carolina. In the upper 10 km of the oligohaline zones, C:N ratios of sediment are characteristic of particulate terrestrial plant material ( > 15). The delta-C-13 values increase linearly with distance from freshwater tributaries to the mouths of the estuaries (approximately 20-parts per thousand salinity), > 40 km from the ocean. Observed gradients in isotopic and C:N ratios imply that conservative mixing of freshwater and marine OC occurs. Phytoplankton in the estuaries produce at least 10 times more particulate OC than is delivered in runoff, however, and its biomass is recycled at rates much faster than those of water exchange. The observed gradients are therefore largely attributed to recycling of a resident pool of estuarine C, atmospheric CO2, and an increasing marine bicarbonate fraction from the salt wedge downriver. Essentially lentic conditions in these estuaries ensure the dominance of in situ biological processes.

AB  - Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured in wetlands in Liminganlahti (Baltic Sea) in the vicinity of the estuaries of the Lumijoki and Temmesjoki. Wetlands were significant sources of CH4, with a mean flux of 206 mg m(-2) d(-1). Methane fluxes correlated positively with temperature and were slightly higher from the wetland of the Lumijoki, where water SO42- concentrations were lower. On average, the wetland close to the Temmesjoki was a small source of N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)), whereas the wetland close to the Lumijoki was a small sink for N2O (mean flux of 131 mu g m(-2) d(-1)). The higher availability of nitrogen in the wetland near the Temmesjoki obviously induced the higher N2O fluxes. Estuarine wetlands seem to be important Sources of atmospheric CH4 but do not represent an important source of N2O although increased N loading.

AB  - Shoreline erosion supplies sediments to estuaries and coastal waters, influencing water clarity and primary production. Globally, shoreline erosion sediment inputs are changing with anthropogenic alteration of coastlines in populated regions. Chesapeake Bay, a prime example of such a system where shoreline erosion accounts for a large proportion of sediments entering the estuary, serves here as a case study for investigating the effects of changing sediment inputs on water clarity. Long-term increases in shoreline armoring have contributed to decreased erosional sediment inputs to the estuary, changing the composition of suspended particles in surface waters. This study examined the impact of shoreline erosion on water clarity using a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Experiments were conducted to simulate realistic shoreline conditions representative of the early 2000s, increased shoreline erosion, and highly armored shorelines. Together, reduced shoreline erosion and the corresponding reduced rates of resuspension result in decreased concentrations of inorganic particles, improving water clarity particularly in the lower Bay and in dry years where and when riverine sediment influence is low. This clarity improvement relaxed light limitation, which increased organic matter production. Differences between the two extreme experiments revealed that in the mid-estuary in February to April, surface inorganic suspended sediment concentrations decreased 3-7 mg L-1, while organic suspended solids increased 1-3 mg L-1. The resulting increase in the organic-to-inorganic ratio often had opposite effects on clarity according to different metrics, improving clarity in mid-Bay central channel waters in terms of light attenuation depth, but simultaneously degrading clarity in terms of Secchi depth because the resulting increase in organic suspended solids decreased the water's transparency.

AB  - We present an 8000-year biomarker and stable carbon isotope record from the Verlorenvlei Estuary, South Africa. We assessed how leaf wax lipids, insoluble macromolecular organic matter, bulk C/N data and compound-specific stable carbon isotopes were linked to the site's palynological record and to evidence for regional sea level and environmental change. Down-core trends in bulk delta C-13 are closely coupled to trends in pollen types from saline-tolerant taxa. These trends are mirrored by variations in the incorporation of reduced sulphur into macromolecular organic matter. This process, quantified with the thiophene ratio, is closely associated with periods of higher sea level 8,000-4,300 cal yr BP. We propose the thiophene ratio is a proxy for relative marine influence within (peri) estuarine sediments. All measured variables indicate differences between early-middle Holocene (8,000-4,300 cal BP) and late Holocene conditions at Verlorenvlei. The former period was more saline and preserves more labile macromolecular organic matter. Marine influence declined after 4,300 cal yr BP, and although the abundance of short-chain-length n-alkanes suggests continued presence of wetland flora until 2,500 cal yr BP, organic matter preservation became poorer and a drying trend was inferred, most notably for the interval 2,500-900 cal BP. Increasing freshwater inundation is apparent during the last 700 cal yr, consistent with several records from this region. Leaf wax n-alkane distributions are largely uncorrelated with bulk organic matter variables, with the exception of the abundance of C-31 and C-33 n-alkanes, which are negatively correlated with delta C-13(TOC). Furthermore, C-31-C-33 n-alkane delta C-13 values are uncorrelated with C-23-C-29 delta C-13 and delta C-13(TOC). They are also higher than our newly measured terrestrial (C-3) vegetation C-29 and C-31 end-member values of -35 +/- A 2 and -34 +/- A 1 aEuro degrees, respectively. These patterns are best explained by a dominant contribution of local riparian vegetation to the C-23-C-29 n-alkanes, but time-varying contributions of non-local leaf waxes to the C-31-C-33 signals. This renders inferences concerning regional environmental change from long-chain leaf waxes potentially challenging in this setting.

AB  - We investigated the effect of growth strategy (i.e., single or mixed plant types) of two emergent plants (i.e., Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis) on the distribution of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and their monoester metabolites (PAMs) in the sediments and roots in two adjacent shallow lakes in Tianjin, China, as well as the removal of PAEs from the sediments.
   Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and their PAMs were measured in sediments and roots sampled on 18th May 2010. PAE-degrading bacteria and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) of the sediment samples were also analyzed.
   The results showed that DBP, DEHP, and their PAMs were detected in nearly all of the samples, and the PAE concentrations were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of their corresponding monoester metabolites. The PAE distribution patterns in sediments from the two lakes were different and influenced by plant growth strategy. Phytoavailability of PAEs was also affected by plant growth strategy.
   Compared with the non-rhizosphere sediments, the total organic carbon-normalized PAE concentration in the rhizosphere sediments decreased in the presence of the emergent plants. The PAE removal from the rhizosphere sediments was related not only to plant species but also to growth strategy, which was consistent with the findings of PLFA. The enhancement of PAE biodegradation in the rhizosphere was mainly the result of changes in the microbial community structure for different plant species and in microbial biomass for the same plant species.

AB  - Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere, which vary along salinity and productivity gradients. Global change has the potential to reshape these gradients and therefore alter future contributions of wetlands to the global CH4 budget. Our study examined CH4 production along a natural salinity gradient in fully inundated coastal Alaska wetlands. In the laboratory, we incubated natural sediments to compare CH4 production rates between non-tidal freshwater and tidal brackish wetlands, and quantified the abundances of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria in these ecosystems. We also simulated seawater intrusion and enhanced organic matter availability, which we predicted would have contrasting effects on coastal wetland CH4 production. Tidal brackish wetlands produced less CH4 than non-tidal freshwater wetlands probably due to high sulfate availability and generally higher abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria, whereas non-tidal freshwater wetlands had significantly greater methanogen abundances. Seawater addition experiments with freshwater sediments, however, did not reduce CH4 production, perhaps because the 14-day incubation period was too short to elicit a shift in microbial communities. In contrast, increased organic matter enhanced CH4 production in 75% of the incubations, but this response depended on the macrophyte species added, with half of the species treatments having no significant effect. Our study suggests that CH4 production in coastal wetlands, and therefore their overall contribution to the global CH4 cycle, will be sensitive to increased organic matter availability and potentially seawater intrusion. To better predict future wetland contributions to the global CH4 budget, future studies and modeling efforts should investigate how multiple global change mechanisms will interact to impact CH4 dynamics.

AB  - Production and productivity (P/B ratio) of the high Antarctic Weddell Sea and Lazarev Sea macrozoobenthos are estimated by an empirical multiple non-linear model (artificial neural network) based on biomass data and other biotic and abiotic parameters. Average community production decreases with depth from 4.8 g C m(-2) year(-1) (100-300 m) to 0.1 g C m(-2) year(-1) (1500-4300 m). Community PIE ratio increases with depth from 0.18 year(-1) to 0.55 year(-1). Taking into account the effects of water depth on production and of temperature on P/E ratio, Antarctic communities show no evidence of unique characteristics with respect to overall energy flow.

AB  - Carbon cycling in the coastal zone affects global carbon budgets and is critical for understanding the urgent issues of hypoxia, acidification, and tidal wetland loss. However, there are no regional carbon budgets spanning the three main ecosystems in coastal waters: tidal wetlands, estuaries, and shelf waters. Here we construct such a budget for eastern North America using historical data, empirical models, remote sensing algorithms, and process-based models. Considering the net fluxes of total carbon at the domain boundaries, 5912% ( 2 standard errors) of the carbon entering is from rivers and 4112% is from the atmosphere, while 809% of the carbon leaving is exported to the open ocean and 209% is buried. Net lateral carbon transfers between the three main ecosystem types are comparable to fluxes at the domain boundaries. Each ecosystem type contributes substantially to exchange with the atmosphere, with CO2 uptake split evenly between tidal wetlands and shelf waters, and estuarine CO2 outgassing offsetting half of the uptake. Similarly, burial is about equal in tidal wetlands and shelf waters, while estuaries play a smaller but still substantial role. The importance of tidal wetlands and estuaries in the overall budget is remarkable given that they, respectively, make up only 2.4 and 8.9% of the study domain area. This study shows that coastal carbon budgets should explicitly include tidal wetlands, estuaries, shelf waters, and the linkages between them; ignoring any of them may produce a biased picture of coastal carbon cycling.
   Plain Language Summary A carbon budget for a particular site or region describes the inputs and outputs of carbon to that site or region as well as the processes that change carbon from one form to another. A carbon budget is needed to fully understand many important issues facing coastal waters. We constructed the carbon budget for coastal waters of eastern North America. We found that about 60% of the carbon entering the domain is from rivers and about 40% is from the atmosphere, while about 80% of the carbon leaving the domain goes to the open ocean and about 20% is buried. Transfers of carbon from wetlands to estuaries and from estuaries to the ocean were as important as transfers of carbon at the domain boundaries. Tidal wetlands and estuaries were found to be important to the carbon budget despite making up only 2.4 and 8.9% of the study domain area, respectively. This study shows that coastal carbon budgets should explicitly consider tidal wetlands, estuaries, shelf waters, and the linkages between them; ignoring any of them may produce a biased picture of coastal carbon cycling.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were used to determine the ultimate autotrophic sources supporting production of three commercially important fish species over unvegetated mudflats in a subtropical estuary. Mean isotope values over the whole estuary for fish and autotroph sources were modeled to indicate feasible combinations of sources. Variability in isotope values among nine locations (separated by 3-10 km) was then used as a further test of the likelihood that sources were involved in fish nutrition. A positive spatial correlation between isotope values of a fish species and an autotroph indicates a substantial contribution from the autotroph. Spatial correlations were tested with a newly developed randomization procedure using differences between fish and autotroph values at each location, based on carbon and nitrogen isotopes combined in two-dimensional space. Both whole estuary modeling and spatial analysis showed that seagrass, epiphytic algae and particulate organic matter in the water column, including phytoplankton, are likely contributors to bream (Acanthopagrus australis) nutrition. However, spatial analysis also showed that mangroves were involved (up to 33% contribution), despite a very low contribution from whole estuary modeling. Spatial analysis on sand whiting (Sillago ciliata) demonstrated the importance of two sources, mangroves (up to 25%) and microalgae on the mudflats, considered unimportant based on whole estuary modeling. No spatial correlations were found between winter whiting (Sillago maculata) and autotrophs, either because fish moved among locations or relied on different autotrophs at different locations. Spatial correlations between consumer and source isotope values provide a useful analytical tool for identifying the role of autotrophs in foodwebs, and demonstrated here that both in situ production of microalgae and organic matter from adjacent habitats were important to fish over mudflats.

AB  - Although hurricanes call damage or destroy coastal wetlands. they may play a beneficial role in reinvigorating marshes by delivering sediments that raise soil elevations and stimulate organic matter production. Hurricane Katrina altered elevation dynamics of two subsiding brackish marshes in the Mississippi River deltaic plain by adding I to 8 cm of sediment to the soil surface in August 2005. Soil elevations at both Sites subsequently declined due to continued Subsidence, but net elevation gain was Still positive at both Pearl River (+1.7 cm) and Big Branch (+0.7 cm) marshes two years after the hurricane. At Big Branch where storm sediments had higher organic matter and water contents, post-storm elevation loss was more rapid Clue to initial compaction of the storm Liver in combination with root-zone collapse. In contrast, elevation loss was slower at Pearl River where file storm deposit (high sand content) did not compact and the root zone did not collapse. Vegetation Lit both Sites fully recovered within one year, and accumulation of root matter at Big Branch increased 10-fold from 2005 to 2006, suggesting that the hurricane stimulated belowground productivity. Results of this Study imply that hurricane sediment may benefit subsiding marshes by slowing elevation loss. However, long-term effects of hurricane sediment oil elevation dynamics will depend not only oil the amount of sediment deposited. but Oil sediment texture and resistance to compaction as well as on changes in organic matter accumulation in the Wars following the hurricane.

AB  - Wetland sediments are generally considered as a sink for metals and, in the anoxic zone, may contain very high concentrations of heavy metals in reduced state. A comprehensive study was carried out to compare the differences of total, environmentally available (Env-Av), HOAC, EDTA and DTPA available heavy metal fraction in tailing of the marshy area of a copper tailing pond and the dry tailing. The average concentrations of all the seven metals in the wetland tailing were found higher than dry tailing. Regarding pH, organic carbon, availailable N, P and K also found higher in marshy wetland tailing compare to the dry tailing. This information is needed in order to understand wetland system and to assure that wetlands do not themselves eventually become sources of metal contamination to surrounding areas. But as levels of pollutants increases, the ability of a wetland system to incorporate waste can be impaired and the wetland can become a source of toxicity.

AB  - Core incubation and oxygen microelectrode measurements were performed at two stations in the Beobsan intertidal flat of Taean Bay on the mid-western Korean Peninsula. Total and diffusive fluxes were determined for four different seasons (August and October 2006 and February and May 2007). Diffusive oxygen fluxes ranged from 7.62 to 11.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S1 and 8.85 to 14.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S2. Total oxygen fluxes varied from 20.2 to 27.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S1 and from 18.7 to 31.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at station S2. Total oxygen fluxes were 2 similar to 3 times higher than diffusive oxygen fluxes, a result that agrees well with previous studies of the coastal and continental shelf area. The difference between the total and diffusive fluxes is caused by the bio-irrigation activities of macrofauna living in the sediments, which enhance the ventilation of the sediment and introduce oxygenated water to the deeper, anoxic sediment layer. The total oxygen flux at station S1 exhibited small seasonal variation while that at station 2 showed large seasonal variation. Organic carbon contents in the surface sediments correlated well with total oxygen flux, suggesting that the input flux of organic matter is a major factor controlling the seasonal variation in total oxygen flux. Annual benthic aerobic respiration rates were determined to be 8.8 and 9.1 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) at stations S1 and S2, respectively; these values are very similar to estimations for Aarhus Bay, Denmark and the southwestern lagoon of New Caledonia.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are increasingly used within urban areas to reduce pollutant runoff, including nitrogen. These environments are exposed to frequent wetting and drying events, and also increasing temperatures due to the heat island effect and seasonal variation. In this study, we have investigated the role of drying and rewetting of sediments and temperature on the partitioning of two nitrate reduction pathways: denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in four constructed urban stormwater wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. Our results suggest that both DNF and DNRA decreased due to drying of sediments, but DNRA decreased to a greater extent. Rates of DNRA from the drying-rewetting treatment decreased 5-90% compared to the control. Moreover, a concomitant increase in NH(4)(+ )fluxes and a slight change in sediment oxygen demand (SOD) suggest that oxic conditions arising from sediment drying was responsible for the decreased rates of DNF and DNRA. Rates of both DNF and DNRA increased with increasing temperature in slurries. The DNF:DNRA ratio suggests that the relative increase in DNRA was more than DNF with increasing temperature. The mean activation energy of DNF ranged from 41 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 4 kJ mol(-1) and the corresponding temperature coefficient (Q(10)) values ranged from 1.3 to 2.4. In comparison, the mean activation energy of DNRA was higher and ranged from 50 +/- 8 to 107 +/- 14 kJ mol(-1) with the corresponding Q(10) values ranging from 1.2 to 3.4. Overall, our results suggest that drying and re-wetting of sediments decreases nitrate reduction and increases nitrogen retention, whereas increased temperature enhances the recycling of bioavailable nitrogen in wet sediments in constructed urban stormwater wetlands.

AB  - Pb-210 geochronologies of Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb fluxes were obtained from the intertidal mudflat sediments of the coastal lagoons Chiricahueto, Estero de Urias, and Ohuira in the Mexican Pacific. The Cu and Hg sediment concentrations at the three lagoons fell within the ranges of 6-76 mu g g(-1) and 0.1 to 592 ng g(-1), respectively; Chiricahueto and Estero de Urias sediments had comparable Cd and Pb concentrations within the ranges of 0.2-2.1 mu g g(-1) and 10-67 mu g g(-1), respectively; whereas in Ohuira lagoon, Cd concentrations were lower (0.1-0.5 mu g g(-1)) and Pb concentrations were higher (115-180 mu g g(-1)) than in the other lagoons. The metal fluxes (mu g cm(-2) y(-1)) for the three lagoons fell within the ranges of 0.02-0.15 for Cd, 0.7-6.0 for Cu, 0.001-0.045 for Hg, and 0.7-20 for Pb. The Hg pollution in Estero de Urias was attributed to the exhausts of the thermoelectric plant of Mazatlan and the metal enrichment in Chiricahueto and Ohuira was related to the agrochemical wastes from the croplands surrounding these lagoons.

AB  - Hypersaline tidal flats (HTFs) are coastal ecosystems with freshwater deficits often occurring in arid or semiarid regions near mangrove supratidal zones with no major fluvial contributions. Here, we estimate that organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were buried at rates averaging 21 (+/- 6), 1.7 (+/- 0.3) and 1.4 (+/- 0.3) gm(-2) yr(-1), respectively, during the previous century in three contrasting HTF systems, one in Brazil (eutrophic) and two in Australia (oligotrophic). Although these rates are lower than those from nearby mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass systems, the importance of HTFs as sinks for OC, TN and TP may be significant given their extensive coverage. Despite the measured short-term variability between net air-saltpan CO2 influx and emission estimates found during the dry and wet season in the Brazilian HTF, the only site with seasonal CO2 flux measurements, the OC sedimentary profiles over several decades suggest efficient OC burial at all sites. Indeed, the stable isotopes of OC and TN (delta C-13 and delta N-1(5)) along with C : N ratios show that microphytobenthos are the major source of the buried OC in these HTFs. Our findings highlight a previously unquantified carbon as well as a nutrient sink and suggest that coastal HTF ecosystems could be included in the emerging blue carbon framework.

AB  - The French 2-tier box trap was evaluated in northwestern Florida to determine its attractiveness to host-seeking tabanids (Diptera) when baited with either CO(2) alone; a 4:1:8 mixture of octenol, 3-n-propylpbenol, and 4-methylphenol; or a combination of CO(2) plus 4:1:8 mixture. Six genera representing 43 species were obtained from this trap. Chrysops and Tabanus made up 10.3 and 87.4% of the total, respectively, with Chrysops celatus Pechuman and Tabanus pallidescens Philip as the predominate species from these two genera. CO(2) alone and in combination with the octenol /phenol mixture enhanced overall tabarrid collections three-to four-fold compared with no odor. Generally, more species were collected in the top tier of the French 2-tier trap regardless of treatment. Those species that showed a significant difference between top and bottom tiers in traps without odors continued this trend when traps were baited with the semiochemicals. However, Tabanus mixis Philip showed no tier preference in traps baited by CO, alone, whereas Tabanus lineola F. showed no stratification difference with or without odors.

AB  - Sediment from a microbial mat from the South-West coast of the Netherlands consumed dimethylsulfide (DMS) under oxic and anoxic conditions. From this sediment, a Gram-negative, oval DMS oxidizing bacterium, strain RB-1, was isolated. Its substrate range is typical of an obligately methylotrophic organism. Enzyme analysis revealed the presence of the ribulose monophosphate pathway for carbon assimilation, and the ability to use the linear dissimilatory pathway via Formate to carbon dioxide, as well as the cyclic pathway via the ribulose monophosphate route for carbon dissimilation. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed high similarity with species belonging to the genus Methylophaga. Because of the specific dimethylsulfide and hydrogen sulfide oxidizing capacity, the new isolate was named Methylophaga sulfidovorans.

AB  - Tidal and seasonal fluctuations in the oligohaline reaches of estuaries may alter geochemical features that influence structure and function of microbial communities involved in sedimentary nitrogen (N) cycling. In order to evaluate sediment community responses to short-term (tidal) and long-term (seasonal) changes in different tidal regimes, nitrogen cycling rates and genes were quantified in three sites that span a range of tidal influence in the upper portion of the Cape Fear River Estuary. Environmental parameters were monitored during low and high tides in winter and spring. N-15 tracer incubation experiments were conducted to measure nitrification, denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA). Abundances of functional genes including bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrite reductases (nirS and nrfA), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo) were measured using quantitative PCR assays. Denitrification rates were highest among the measured N cycling processes while bacteria carrying nrfA genes were most abundant. A discernable pattern in the short-term variation of N cycling rates and gene abundance was not apparent under the different tidal regimes. Significant seasonal variation in nitrification, denitrification, and anammox rates as well as bacterial amoA, nirS and nosZ gene abundance was observed, largely explained by increases in substrate availability during winter, with sediment ammonium playing a central role. These results suggest that the coupling of nitrification to N removal pathways is primarily driven by organic carbon mineralization and independent of tidal or salinity changes. Finally, changes in denitrification and nitrification activities were strongly reflected by the abundance of the respective functional genes, supporting a linkage between the structure and function of microbial communities.

AB  - Although root litter contributes to a large extent to soil organic matter accumulation in peatlands, decomposition of root litter is often neglected in studies on litter decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. In this study, decomposition of root and rhizome litter of Carex diandra and Carex lasiocarpa was determined in two temperate fens, one dominated by Sphagnum species (Sphagnum, fen; soil pH = 4.4) and one without a Sphagnum cover Carex fen: soil pH = 5.7. One-year mass loss increased in the order: roots Carex diandra < roots Carex lasiocarpa < rhizomes Carex lasiocarpa. This ranking was in agreement with the generally established relationships between decomposition rate and litter chemistry, since rhizome litter had the lowest concentration of lignin and the highest nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. The decomposition constants (k-values) varied from 0.10 to 0.30 yr(-1), which is at the low end of the range found for above-ground litter of Carex species in other studies. Decomposition rates of root litter were lower in the Sphagnum site than in the Carex site, probably as a result of a lower pH and a lower nutrient status in the Sphragnum site. At both sites, N and P content of the litter decreased rapidly in the first three months indicating fast nutrient leaching and mineralization. Nutrient release per unit initial litter mass in the Carex site did not differ from that in the Sphagnum site. Estimated first year losses of N and P from Carex diandra roots in the Carex site were 2.31 g N m(-2) and 0.20 g P m(-2) First-pear nutrient losses From leaf litter of this species, as determined in another study, were only 0.06 g N m(-2) and 0.02 g P m(-2). These results show that roots do indeed play a major role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in temperate fen ecosystems.

AB  - Fifty-two water samples were collected from the surface at the entrance of a coastal lagoon for evaluation of microheterotrophic processes. The study was carried out during a period of neap and spring tides over 14 consecutive days. Bacteria, microphyloplankton and zooplankton direct counts were made, along with fractionated respiratory activity. Nutrient, C/N ratio, total organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, carbon, seston, dissolved oxygen, particulate silica and chlorophyll a determinations were also made. Phytoplankton biomass was low (9.5-mu-g C l-1) and was exceeded by bacterial biomass (89.4-mu-g C l-1) at both spring and neap tides. Bacterial abundance was independent of tidal height and increased with intense water movement at spring tides. Autotrophic production was limited by light penetration and nutrient availability. Most of the respiratory activity in the water column (> 50 %) occurred in the less-than-or-equal-to 0.8-mu-m size fraction. Bacterial standing stocks sustained carbon production in the water column. Significant negative correlation between bacteria and nanoplankton suggests a trophic structure dependent on dissolved organic carbon inputs from marsh flora, followed by a trophic chain composed of bacteria, nanoplankton, microzooplankton and Acartia sp. It is suggested that food chains stemming from dissolved organic carbon instead of phytoplankton may play a major role in the system since tidal dynamics enhanced bacterial standing stocks during spring and neap tides.

AB  - Oyster populations within the coastal bays of Virginia have greatly declined, mainly due to overharvesting and disease, and past restoration efforts have largely focused on increasing their populations. Current restoration goals have now expanded to simultaneously procure the wider ecosystem services oysters can offer, including shoreline protection and ecosystem diversification. However, tradeoffs exist in designing artificial reefs because it is unlikely one design will optimize all services. This study compares the services provided by reef designs varying in elevation and width located adjacent to an intertidal marsh within a coastal bay of VA, USA. We quantified wave attenuation to determine potential coastal protection of the adjacent marsh, and changes to sediment composition and infaunal communities before and after reef construction for 3 years. After construction, we also quantified oyster size and population density to compare high and low elevation reef designs. High elevation reefs were more effective at attenuating waves and fostering oyster growth compared to low elevation reefs. Oysters atop high elevation reefs were on average approximately twice as dense and 20% larger than those on low elevation designs. Reef width had a minimal effect on oyster population density; densities on high and low reefs were similar for designs with one or three rows. The presence of oyster reefs also increased infaunal diversity and sediment organic matter. Our results indicate that artificial reef design can differentially affect the services provided through restoration, and elevation is especially important to consider when designing for oyster population enhancement and coastal protection.

AB  - The influence of the crab Parasesarma erythrodactyla on the entry of the organic matter derived from Avicennia marina mangrove leaves in a sub-tropical mangrove ecosystem of southeast Queensland, Australia, was simulated using tidal mesocosms. Degradation of mangrove leaf organic matter was followed by analysing the fatty acid composition, carbon, and nitrogen isotopic signatures of the surface sediment and suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) with and without the presence of crabs. Assimilation of mangrove organic matter by P. erythrodactyla was also assessed by stable isotope and fatty acid analyses in tissues and faeces. Results of the chemical tracer analyses question the adaptability of P. erythrodactyla to a diet comprised exclusively of mangrove leaves, and suggest that these organisms were dependent on additional food sources in their natural environment. Crab processing of senescent leaves significantly accelerated the transfer of mangrove organic matter to the surface sediments, as shown by a higher C/N ratio, a higher contribution of long-chain fatty acids and a more depleted C isotopic signature of sediment samples in the mesocosms with crabs compared to those without crabs.

AB  - Despite remaining closed for variable periods, intermittently open estuaries provide habitat for estuarine and marine fish species of commercial and recreational value. To better understand how these systems trophically support their fish assemblages, the diets of four valued fish species, namely Acanthopagrus australis, Platycephalus fuscus, Sillago ciliata and Mugil cephalus, were examined in two intermittently open estuaries in New South Wales, Australia. Fish diets were determined using both gut contents and stable isotope analyses because the different temporal resolutions afforded by these methods can provide insight into the flexibility of fish diets. Stable isotope signatures of prey and fish proved to be particularly useful in analyses of the diets of M. cephalus and P. fuscus, because these species consume large quantities of unidentifiable organic matter and have high incidences of empty guts respectively. Diet reconstructions across methods were generally consistent for A. australis, but differed substantially for S. ciliata, with fewer prey taxa identified in the guts than expected. This result suggests that individual S. ciliata switch between local resources on the basis of their fluctuating temporal availability. Trophic flexibility, coupled with broad physicochemical tolerances, enables these species to flourish in the challenging environment of intermittently open estuaries.

AB  - Two types of deposit-feeding polychaetes, Neanthes japonica and Notomastus sp., and their surrounding sediments were collected from the Nanakita River Estuary and a small brackish lagoon (Gamo Lagoon) in northeastern Japan. The samples were examined using stable isotope analysis to assess the site specific feeding mode of the animals and their trophic status. N. japonica is a surface deposit-feeder and Notomastus sp. is a subsurface deposit-feeder. In the estuary, the sedimentary delta N-15 tended to become isotopically heavier from the upper estuary (2.0 similar to 3.9 parts per thousand) to the river mouth (4.3 similar to 6.2 parts per thousand), while sedimentary organic delta C-13 exhibited no such trend and maintained a rather constant value (-26.8 similar to -24.4, average -25.6 parts per thousand) throughout the river estuary. The delta C-13 values of N. japonica were similar to those of the surrounding sediment in the upper estuary, whereas in the lower estuary, N. japonica had a heavier delta C-13 value than the surrounding sediment. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values indicated that the carbon, but not the nitrogen, of N. japonica was derived from upland plants in the upper estuary. In the lower estuary, a significant fraction of carbon of N. japonica was derived from phytoplankton. Notomastus sp. exhibited heavier delta C-13 values than the surrounding surface sediment throughout the estuary and had heavier delta C-13 values than N. japonica in the same location. These results suggest selective utilization of sedimentary carbon by those animals following bacterial processing and subsequent fractionation. The difference in delta N-15 between sedimentary organics and corresponding polychaetes was 5 +/- 1 parts per thousand and rather higher than 3.4 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand expected for normal trophic effects in other animals.

AB  - Fifty six sediment cores were collected along a 100 km longitudinal transect of the Thames estuary. Total Hg ranged from 0.01 to 12.07 mg/kg, with a mean of 2.10 mg/kg (n = 351). Concentrations of the toxic metal decreased downstream from London to the outer estuary and were positively correlated to total organic carbon (TOC) content. Many Hg profiles showed a clear rise, peak and fall, reflecting changing anthropogenic input through time. Surface concentrations averaged 1.27 mg/kg, confirming the effectiveness of recent environmental legislation and improved river management. Sediments at > 40 cm depth from London reaches of the river (Waterloo Bridge, Cuckolds Point (Rotherhithe), Butlers Wharf (Tower Bridge), Millwall, Deptford and Millennium Dome) were highly contaminated, with levels of Hg of > 7 mg/kg. The outer Thames had lower Hg, with the exception of Rainham, Crossness and Cliffe. Benchmarking against UK guidelines for the disposal of dredged material revealed that 88 samples from 21 sites exceeded the 3 mg/kg criteria (unsuitable for disposal at sea); 173 fell between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg (further assessment required); and 90 were of no concern. Using Hg as a generic pollution marker, the tidal Thames is one of the world's most contaminated river-estuarine sediment systems.

AB  - The environmental occurrence, fate and ecotoxicity of emerging contaminants (ECs) has been the subject of increasing research, policy and public concern over the past two decades. While a wide range of publications have examined the environmental persistence and sediment/soil interactions of ECs following their discharge into aquatic environments, the extent to which ECs are sequestered in estuarine sediments, and the impact of this on their environmental persistence and supply to the ocean, in comparison remains unclear. This Article examines the environmental concentrations of seven, relatively water-soluble and environmentally mobile, ECs (including pharmaceuticals, perfluoroalkyl compounds, and plasticisers) in dated intertidal saltmarsh cores from two contrasting estuarine sites in the southern U.K. (one heavily urbanised/industrial, the other non-urbanised). Mean sediment EC concentrations are similar in both estuarine systems (in the range 0.1 (acetaminophen) to 17 (4-hydroxyacetophenone) ng/g dry weight). Despite their variable reported Log K-ow values (from ca. 0.5 to > 7), the ECs are all apparently mobile in the marsh systems studied, and where subsurface concentration maxima are present these most likely relate to local flushing or diffusive processes and cannot be clearly linked to likely input trends or changes in sediment geochemistry (including sedimentary organic carbon content). The "estuarine filter" here, at least with respect to intertidal saltmarsh sediments, shows reduced potential to sequester the seven ECs examined and mediate their supply to coastal and shelf environments.

AB  - We present a comparative analysis of the biomass dynamics of the two dominant Spartina plant species in South West Atlantic saltmarshes: Spartina densiflora Brong. (high intertidal zone) and Spartina alterniflora Loesel. (mid-low intertidal zone). We assessed aboveground biomass, live: dead ratios, net production, mortality and turnover rates, and then used this information to understand if saltmarshes dominated by one or the other Spartina species have different ecosystemic roles in the recycling of organic matter. Through field sampling we found that S. densiflora had larger live, dead and total biomass than S. alterniflora. When comparing within each species, S. alterniflora had larger live than dead biomass for most of the year, while S. densiflora had more dead than live biomass. Through the Weigert and Evans (1964) net aerial primary production (NAPP) estimating method we found that S. densiflora had larger annual NAPP, annual mortality and live turnover rates than S. alterniflora. In both species the amount of NAPP was similar to the amount of annual mortality. These results suggest that S. densiflora aboveground biomass is a carbon accumulation zone, while S. alterniflora is a carbon recycling one. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal reclamation seriously disturbs coastal wetland ecosystems, while its influences on soil microbial communities remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition. These changes were driven primarily by variations in soil nutrient substrates and physiochemical properties. Changes in soil microbial communities following coastal reclamation impacted the decomposition and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, with potential modification of carbon and nitrogen sinks in the ecosystems, with potential feedbacks in response to climate change.

AB  - Tidal flat elevation in the estuarine wetland determines the tidal flooding time and flooding frequency, which will inevitably affect the formation of iron plaque and accumulations of heavy metals (HMs) in wetland plants. The present study investigated the formation of iron plaque and HM's (copper, zinc, lead, and chromium) accumulation in S. alterniflora, a typical estuarine wetland species, at different tidal flat elevations (low, middle and high) in filed and at different time (3, 6, 9, 12 h per day) of waterlogging treatment in greenhouse conditions. Results showed that the accumulation of copper, zinc, lead, and chromium in S. alterniflora was proportional to the exchangeable fraction of these metals in the sediments, which generally increased with the increase of waterlogging time, whereas the formations of iron plaque in roots decreased with the increase of waterlogging time. Under field conditions, the uptake of copper and zinc in the different parts of the plants generally increased with the tidal levels despite the decrease in the metals' exchangeable fraction with increasing tidal levels. The formation of iron plaque was found to be highest in the middle tidal positions and significantly lower in low and high tidal positions. Longer waterlogging time increased the metals' accumulation but decreased the formation of iron plaque in S. alterniflora. The binding of metal ions on iron plaque helped impede the uptake and accumulation of copper and chromium in S. alterniflora.

AB  - The meiofauna represent a highly informative faunal group for ecological evaluation in marine ecosystems, but few studies have investigated their spatial distribution patterns in tidal creeks. As an important component of the tidal flat, tidal creeks tend to have unique, contrasting habitats associated with erosion and accretion beds within a short distance of each other. The gradient represented by these habitats is expected to have consequences on the meiofauna and nematode communities. Based on sediment samples from two tidal creeks on a tidal flat covered with very fine-grained sediments, we show that there are distinct relationships between the benthic habitats, meiofauna/nematode communities and the erosion/accretion status of the tidal creek bed. Although there were no differences in sediment grain size between the eroding and accretion sides of the creek, higher sedimentary phaeopigment, total organic carbon and water contents were observed at the accreting side compared to the eroding side. The meiofauna exhibited a significant spatial variability between the two sides. The dominant taxon, nematodes, was more abundant on the accretion side, whilst copepods were more abundant on the erosion side of the creeks. The nematode/copepod ratio was in agreement with the observation that more pollutants and/or organic matter settled down on the accretion side. A total of 53 nematode genera were identified, belonging to 3 orders and 22 families. The prevalence of tolerant nematode genera such as Desmodora, Sabatieria and Viscosia, suggested that nematodes inhabiting highly dynamic environments are well adapted to the physical disturbance. Our results show that geomorphic evolution as implied by erosion/accretion patterns are reflected in the meiofauna and nematode communities and can be assessed using different community characteristics.

AB  - Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) rates were measured over an annual cycle in meadows of the seagrass Z. noltii and uncolonised sediments of the Bassin d'Arcachon, south-west France, using both slurry and whole core techniques. Measured rates using the slurry technique in Z. noltii colonised sediments were consistently higher than those determined in isolated cores. This was probably due to the release of labile organic carbon sources during preparation of the slurries. Thus, in colonised sediments the whole core technique may provide a more accurate estimate of in situ activity. Acetylene reduction rates measured by the whole core technique in colonised sediments were 1.8 to 4-fold greater, dependent upon the season, in the light compared with those measured in the dark, indicating that organic carbon released by the plant roots during photosynthesis was an important factor regulating nitrogen fixation. In contrast acetylene reduction rates in uncolonised sediments were independent of light. Addition of sodium molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulphate reduction inhibited acetylene reduction activity in Z. noltii colonised sediments by >80% as measured by both slurry and whole core techniques irrespective of the light regime, throughout the year inferring that sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) were the dominant component of the nitrogen fixing microflora. A mutualistic relationship between Z. noltii and nitrogen fixing SRB in the rhizosphere, based on the exchange of organic carbon and fixed nitrogen is proposed. In uncolonised sediments sodium molybdate initially severely inhibited acetylene reduction rates, but the fever of this inhibition declined over the course of the year. These data indicate that the nitrogen fixing SRB associated with the Zostera roots and rhizomes were progressively replaced by an aerobic population of nitrogen fixers associated with the decomposition of this recalcitrant high C:N ratio organic matter.
   Acetylene and sulphate reduction rates in the seagrass beds showed distinct summer maxima which correlated with a reduced availability of NH4+ in the sediment and the growth cycle of Z. noltii in the Bassin. Overall, these data indicate that acetylene reduction (nitrogen fixation) activity in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii was regulated both by release of organic carbon from the plant roots and maintenance of low ammonium concentrations in the root zone due to efficient ammonium assimilation.
   Nitrogen fixation rates determined from acetylene reduction rates measured by the whole core technique ranged from 0.1 to 7.3 mg N m(-2) d(-1) in the Z. noltii beds and between 0.02 and 3.7 mg N m(-2) d(-1) in uncolonised sediments, dependent upon the season. Nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii was calculated to contribute between 0.4 and 1.1 g N m(-2) y(-1) or between 6.3 and 12% of the annual fixed nitrogen requirement of the plants. Heterotrophic nitrogen fixation therefore represents a substantial local input of fixed nitrogen to the sediments of this shallow coastal lagoon and contributes to the overall productivity of Z. noltii in this ecosystem.

AB  - Remineralization of organic carbon in deep-sea sediments is thought to proceed primarily via aerobic respiration and sulfate reduction because the supply of nitrate and metal oxides is not usually significant in deep-sea sediments. Dissimilatory metal reduction, on the other hand, may represent a dominant pathway in coastal and continental shelf sediments where delivery of terrigenous Fe(III) and Mn(IV/III) oxides is sufficiently high or where physical mixing processes near the sediment-water interface can result in the reoxidation of Fe2+ or Mn2+. Passive continental margin sediments receiving outflow from large rivers are well-known deposition centers for organic carbon and may also be hotspots for metal-reducing microbial activity, considering the simultaneous rapid deposition of unconsolidated metal oxides of terrigenous origin. Despite its potential, only a few studies have examined the role of microbial metal reduction in C-org remineralization in these environments. To investigate carbon remineralization processes in continental margin sediments, shallow cores across channels and levees in the Congo River fan (similar to 5000 m) and Louisiana slope (<1800 m) were profiled for the main redox species involved in early diagenesis using a combination of voltammetric gold mercury (Au/Hg) microelectrodes and conventional analyses. Interestingly, metal reduction dominated carbon remineralization processes in the top similar to 20 cm of sediment subject to high deposition, while evidence for sulfate reduction was lacking. These findings suggest that dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction may be more significant than previously thought in continental slope sediments, which may have important implications on carbon cycling in marine environments. In addition, these findings may have geological implications in controlling atmospheric oxygen levels over geological time and the evolution of microbial life on Earth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofilms and microbial mats cover the tidal flats of the central zone of the Bahia Blanca estuary (Argentina), creating extensive layers. The objective of this study was to characterize the microphytobenthic communities in these biofilms and mats from sediment cores taken in March, June, September and December 2010. Microorganisms were identified and enumerated by microscopy, and their biomass (chlorophyll a, biovolume) quantified at two different stations in the lower supratidal zone, located approximate to 210m apart from each other (namely S1 and S2). Additionally, the colloidal carbohydrates produced by these microbial communities were quantified, together with physical parameters such as temperature, granulometry, moisture and organic matter content of the sediment layers that comprise a typical epibenthic mat. On the other hand, changes in biomass and colloidal carbohydrate content were studied through a half-tidal cycle (7h). There were significant seasonal differences in microphytobenthic biovolume (P < 0.001) with a considerably lower biomass in summer, but no significant differences in microalgal biovolume between stations (P = 0.454). Cyanobacterial biomass (largely composed of the filamentous Microcoleus chthonoplastes) was dominant on all dates at both stations, followed by pennate diatoms. Chlorophyll a and colloidal carbohydrate contents in sediment presented a similar pattern to that of microalgal biovolume; with a 5-fold variation in chlorophyll a for S1 between consecutive sampling events on September and December. There were significant differences between sampling dates in colloidal carbohydrates (P < 0.001) with the lowest values recorded during fall and winter; conversely there were no significant differences between stations (P = 0.324). Silt was the dominant sediment fraction at S1 while sand dominated throughout the uppermost 20mm at S2. Chlorophyll a contents did not show significant differences throughout a half-tidal cycle, likely the product of vertical migration along the section sampled. Conversely, the content of colloidal carbohydrates varied 5-fold, showing a significant (P < 0.001) and steady increase with time of exposure to air and pointing to the rapid metabolic rates of the community. In conclusion, the microphytobenthic community of the Bahia Blanca estuary presented marked seasonality in its biological parameters and overall physiognomy, also showing elevated metabolic rates when subject to tidal fluctuations.

AB  - The community structure and diet of benthic macrofauna in a Spartina alterniflora wetland and restored native Kandelia obovata mangrove forests of different ages were compared in Zhangjiangkou estuary, China. The biodiversity and total density of benthic macrofauna did not change after the restoration of Spartina wetlands with native mangrove species. However, the total biomass decreased significantly approximately half a year after physical treatments. This decrease in total biomass resulted from a change in the dominant gastropod from the larger Cerithidea djariensis to the smaller Assimine abrevicula. Gastropod and crab species in the Spartina wetland derived more than 80 % of their organic carbon from Spartina. Preliminary physical treatment and plantings of K. obovata did not change the diets of benthic macrofauna during year one of the restoration, but delta C-13 values in gastropod and crab species collected in both 10- and 40-year K. obovata forests were more depleted than those measured in the Spartina wetland, indicating a change in the diet of benthic macrofauna from homogenous to heterogeneous. These results suggest that biological replacement using native mangrove species can not only successfully control the spread of invasive Spartina, but also restore the diverse food web typical of a mature mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - The Orbetello lagoon, one of the largest Western Mediterranean lagoons, was affected by high algal blooms and severe anoxic crises in 1992 and 1993, with fish mortality throughout most of the lagoon and a drastic reduction of benthic species. Many measures were undertaken between 1994 and 1996 to remove the severe eutrophication of this lagoon. Such measures included harvesting of the floating seaweed biomass, removal of all wastewater and sea channel enlargement by dredging activity. The aim of the present research was to study the macrozoobenthic assemblage in 1999 and to compare it with previous research in order to assess the recovery of the lagoon. A total of 106 taxa and 45175 individuals were collected in three areas (sea inlets, western and eastern lagoon) having different organic matter loading during winter and summer. The results of multivariate and correlation analyses indicated that trophic status and its seasonal dynamics were crucial in determining species distribution among the different areas. Moreover, comparison of the macrozoobenthic structure between winter 1995 and 1999 showed differences in species composition and structural parameters in the western and eastern lagoon, where a clear recovery of benthic assemblages was observed in 1999, However, the dominance of opportunistic species in most of the lagoon and the decrease in some structural parameters during summer suggested that this basin still presented signs of disturbance in 1999, six years after the last extended anoxic crises and even after completion of the restoration measures carried out in the environment. It was hypothesized that a secondary disturbance, sustained by a high seasonal release of nutrients from the sediments, could create considerable deviations from the expected improvement in benthic conditions, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Deteriorating of urban river environment in Yangzhou is gradually serious in recent years. Treatment measures including pollution source control, sewage interception, and sludge dredging have been carried out in recent years, but urban river environment is still poor. In order to ascertain the causes, post-dredging effects were assessed based on sediment chemical quality in urban rivers of Yangzhou. Results indicate that post-dredging effects are not ideal because of backward dredging technique and incomplete pollution control. Eutrophication degree is still relatively high for most of them and pollution degree of nutrients is total phosphorus (TP) > total nitrogen (TN) > organic matter (OM). Although the pollution of heavy metals is not serious, the major pollution factors Cd and Hg should still be monitored intensively in the sludge dredging for the toxic effect of heavy metals.

AB  - Saltmarshes are known for higher primary productivity and play a crucial role in carbon-sequestration, nutrient-cycling, and ecological services; however, scarce information are available on halophyte residue mineralization and microbial community structure during decomposition. Soil microcosms with residues (1% w/w) of three dominant halophytes (Aeluropus lagopoides, Arthrocnemum indicum, and Suaeda nudiflora) and one control were incubated under laboratory conditions and sampled at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 90 days to link the microbial community structure and residues decomposition in degraded coastal soil. Samples were subjected to identification of active microbial groups and residue mineralization using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and CO2 evolution methods, respectively. Biochemical composition of residues was also analyzed. Cumulative CO2 evolution was elevated in residue-amended soils compared with control, and it was highest in Arthrocnemum followed by Suaeda, Aeluropus, and control soil. The Aeluropus residue decomposed slower than others due to its high C/N ratio and low protein content. The contents of total FAME and biomarker FAMEs of microbial groups (bacterial, fungal, and actinomycetes) responded positively to the residue amendments compared with control, which indicate the improvement in soil microbial biomass. Soils amended with Suaeda had the highest amount of total (76.8 nmol/g) and fungal FAMEs (6.7 nmol/g), and bacterial (28.6 nmol/g) and actinomycete (3.0 nmol/g) FAMEs were elevated in Arthrocnemum amended soil. At the same time, soils amended with Suaeda (6.2%), Arthrocnemum (28.4%), and control (15.4%) had the greatest abundance of fungal, Gram-negative and Gram-positive FAME biomarkers, respectively. The present study suggests that residue of halophyte species affected the abundance of fungal and bacterial biomarkers, and the microbial community structure.

AB  - Efficient nitrate removal from wetlands depends on denitrification. Macrophytes support denitrification by supplying organic carbon. Organic carbon available to denitrifying bacteria is released from plant litter and from living macrophytes. Macrophytes offer attachment surfaces for epiphytes, also producing organic matter, and for denitrifying bacteria. Emergent macrophytes are generally more productive than submerged macrophytes, but submerged macrophytes have more epiphytes and offer a larger attachment area in the water column for denitrifying bacteria. Emergent and submerged vegetation differ in their seasonal patterns of release of organic carbon. We conclude that a mixture of emergent and submerged macrophytes may be beneficial for nitrogen removal in wetlands with a surface-flow of nitrate-rich water. The influence of vegetation on wetland hydraulics must also be considered. A wetland design with deeper parts favoring submerged macrophytes alternating, along the water few, with shallower parts covered by emergent macrophytes, may promote denitrification processes and distribution of water flow.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a global and persistent pollutant which can be methylated to more toxic forms (methylmercury; MeHg) in natural systems. Both forms pose a health risk to humans and wildlife, and exposure often begins in aquatic environments. Therefore, quantifying aquatic concentrations and identifying source pathways is important for understanding biotic exposure. In this study, data from estuaries in the Northeast United States were combined to evaluate how point source contamination impacts the concentration and source dynamics of water column total and MeHg with an emphasis on sediment versus non-sediment sources. Partial least squares regression models were implemented to identify a set of variables most related to water column MeHg and total Hg (HgT) across the estuaries. The main findings suggest that contaminated sites have strong internal recycling of HgT that dominates over external inputs, and this leads to elevated concentrations of HgT and MeHg in the local water columns. However, HgT sources in uncontaminated estuarine systems have a strong connection to the local watershed with dissolved HgT linked to dissolved organic carbon, and particulate HgT linked to watershed land use and estuarine mixing. There was little correlative evidence that water column MeHg concentrations were linked to sediment in such systems, but unlike HgT, the concentrations were also not clearly linked to the watershed. Instead, in situ methylation of dissolved water column HgT appeared to dominate the MeHg source pathway. The results suggest that Hg point-source contaminated sites should be considered independently from non-contaminated sites in terms of management, and that land use plays an important indirect role in coastal MeHg dynamics.

AB  - One year of continuous data from two eddy-flux towers established along an elevation gradient in coastal Shanghai was analyzed to evaluate the tidal effect on carbon flux (F-c) over an estuarine wetland. The measured wavelet spectra and cospectra of F-c and other environmental factors demonstrated that the dynamics of F-c at both sites exhibited a tidal-driven pattern with obvious characteristics at scales between 10 and 20 days (256-512-h). Environmental factors exerted major controls on the carbon balance at finer temporal scales F-c was more sensitive to tides at the low-elevation site than at the high-elevation site. Overall, the mean nighttime F-c during spring tides was lower than that during neap, tides, indicating suppressed ecosystem respiration under inundation. Larger differences were observed at the low-elevation site due to longer inundation durations. In contrast, daytime F-c was more variable since plants reacted differently in different growth periods and under different tidal elevations. The amplitudes of diurnal F-c during tidal periods were larger than those reported for other wetland types, implying a great potential for future carbon sequestration. Whilst tides would also transport organic matter to nearby estuaries and hence may incur carbon emission in the receiving ecosystems. Thus, further study on lateral carbon transport is required to investigate the tidal effect on the carbon sink/source role of the wetland. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Shuaiba Lagoon is a fossil back-reef, hypersaline small basin located 80 km south of Jeddah city on the eastern Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia. The surface sediments of the lagoon were investigated for their benthic foraminiferal content in order to correlate, in general, with environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, pH, sediment grain size, organic matter and, in particular, with tidal elevations to develop a training set for predicting sea-level changes in the lagoon. Hierarchical cluster analysis divided the benthic foraminifera in the Shuaiba Lagoon into four distinct faunal assemblages. Quinqueloculina cf. Q. limbata (Assemblage 1) and Monalysidium acicularis (Assemblage 2) assemblages dominated the intertidal-high subtidal areas (0.3 to -0.5 m, LAT). The Peneroplis planatus-Sorites orbiculus Assemblage 3 occurred abundantly at all subtidal elevations (0 to -1 m, LAT), whereas the Quinqueloculina costata-Spiroloculina communis-Elphidium striatopunctatum Assemblage 4 dominated the lowest elevations (<-1.5 m, LAT) in the lagoon. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the intertidal-high subtidal assemblages were positively correlated with tidal elevations in the Shuaiba Lagoon, consequently, their training set yielded a model predicting sea-level changes with a precision of +/- 0.16 m, but when they were incorporated with the lowest-elevation (low subtidal and below subtidal) assemblages, a wide error (+/- 0.33 m) was produced. Abundance distributions of all assemblages were also affected by the other environmental factors such as salinity, organic matter and temperature, but pH was an important controlling factor on many assemblages due, likely, to high algal photosynthesis in algal-dense substrates. The effect of these factors on the predictability of the intertidal-high subtidal training set is unavoidable and it could be compromised by making a model from the different niches of the intertidal-high subtidal area.

AB  - In the shallow coastal area of the brackish water ecosystem of the Baltic Sea, between the Islands of Rugen and Hiddensee (Southern Baltic, Germany), methane emission was continuously determined with floating measuring chambers and automatic sampling equipment. Data were collected during six measuring periods in two years (1995, 1996).
   The evaluation of more than 5700 measuring series demonstrated very strong seasonal and interannual variations of methane emission, with extremely high rates in the range between 24 and 104 mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1) in June/July 1995, and the lowest values in the range between 0.03 and 0.11 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in October 1996. The highest single emission rate was 243 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Therefore this shore region represents, at least periodically, a hot spot for methane emission from a brackish water ecosystem into the atmosphere.
   The crucial controlling factor for the interannual and seasonal variations of methane emission and also for the small spatial differences was found to be the amount of organic matter in the sediment. This exerted a direct influence on methanogenesis and additionally indirect effects an oxygen dynamics and the relationships between methanogenesis and sulphate reduction.
   The significant correlation between methane emission and temperature in the water and sediment demonstrated that diurnal and long-term variations of emission rates during each season were mainly regulated by temperature. Only at low emission rates did other, indirect ecological factors become more important in controlling methane emission. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - The effect of bridge shading on estuarine marsh food webs was assessed by comparing benthic invertebrate communities beneath seven highway bridges with marshes outside of bridge-affected areas (reference marshes). We used light attenuation and height-width ratio (HW ratio), which takes into account the two main bridge characteristics that determine the degree of shading, to quantify the impact of shading on invertebrate communities. Low bridges, with HW ratio <0.7 and light attenuation greater than 85-90%, had benthic invertebrate densities and diversity that were significantly lower than reference marshes. Density of benthic invertebrates at low bridges was 25-52% (29,685-72,920 organisms/m(2)) of densities measured in adjacent reference marshes (119,329-173,351 organisms/m(2)). Likewise, there were fewer taxa under low bridges (5.8/11.35 cm(2) core) as compared to the reference marshes (9.0/11.35 cm(2) core). Density of numerically dominant taxa (e.g., oligochaetes and nematodes) as well as surface- and subsurface deposit feeders also were reduced under low bridges. Decreased invertebrate density, diversity, dominant taxa, and alterations of trophic feeding groups beneath low bridges was correlated with diminished above- and below-ground macrophyte biomass that presumably resulted in fewer food resources and available refuges from predators. With a greater knowledge of bridge shading effects, bridge construction and design may be improved to reduce the impacts on estuarine benthic invertebrate communities and overall ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Urbanization is an important ecological modifier of stream catchments and significantly alters C type and concentration and heavy metal input to aquatic systems. C and heavy metals are important determinants of microbial community structure (population dynamics) and function (physiological processes). Understanding how changes at the landscape scale affect key nutrient-transformation processes (e.g., denitrification) and C metabolism (e.g., methanogenesis) at the micro scale requires simultaneous determination of the structural and functional responses of bacterial communities. We compared total bacterial (16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid [rRNA] gene) and denitrifying bacterial (nosZ gene) community structures in sediments taken from an urban and a nonurban stream before and after C and Zn additions. Microcosms containing stream sediment were supplemented with either proteinaceous or leaf-leachate C, increasing the C content by similar to 36 and 130 mg/L, respectively. C was added in the presence and absence of Zn addition (200 mg/kg). Changes in community function were determined simultaneously with additions by measuring the rates of CO(2), N(2), and CH(4) accumulation in the headspace of each mesocosm. Site had the greatest effect on total and denitrifying bacterial community structures. Added C caused a small but significant change in total bacterial community structure, but did not change denitrifying bacterial community structure. C enrichment caused a significant and rapid change in community function. Rates of methanogenesis were significantly higher at the nonurban than at the urban site and were significantly affected by C type (significant site x C interaction). Denitrification and CO(2) production were unaffected by C additions but differed between sites. Zn addition changed total bacterial community structure but not denitrifying bacterial community structure. Zn affected the rate of methanogenesis, but the effect size was less than for C type. Community structures remained different between sites at the end of the study despite exposure to Zn concentrations that reflected conditions in urbanized streams and C sources that mimicked those from urban or nonurban streams. Our study supports previous observations that microbial community structure is strongly influenced by prior sediment history. The broader implication is that landscape-scale changes like urbanization alter other physical and chemical properties of the stream sediment that influence community structure more than the Zn or C concentrations in our study.

AB  - Rates of sediment O2 uptake, CO2 production, sulfate reduction and acetate turnover were examined during January 1992 in the Ao Nam Bor mangrove, Phuket, Thailand. The impact of air exposure on O2 uptake was most pronounced in the intensely bioturbated high-intertidal zone (6.4 times higher than during water cover), and decreased to almost zero in the low-intertidal zone. This indicates a gradual increased area of sediment-air contact zones with tidal elevation due to changes in surface topography. Based on an average water cover for January, the diurnal O2 uptake - and thus total decay of deposited detritus - was 4 to 5 and 8 times faster in the high-intertidal compared to the mid- and low-intertidal zones, respectively. Sulfate reduction rates were generally low. The depth-integrated (0 to 30 cm) sulfate reduction was highest in the mid-intertidal zone, and supported 85 % of the estimated daily CO2 release. In the high- and low-intertidal zones, sulfate reduction supported 11 and 92 %, respectively, of daily CO2 release. Rates of acetate uptake were also higher in the mid-than in the low-intertidal zone (no data from high-intertidal). However, the depth-integrated acetate uptake was consistently about 2.6 times the rates of CO2 release and 5 to 6 times the 0 to 11 cm integrated sulfate reduction, which suggests that pool sizes of acetate and thus uptake rates may have been overestimated. In conclusion, while benthic respiration in the mid- and low-intertidal zones of the Ao Nam Bor mangrove was dominated by sulfate reduction with acetate as carbon source, 'suboxic' conditions related to bioturbation in the active high-intertidal sediment made respiration by other electron acceptors than SO42- more important.

AB  - Ecological applications of stable isotope analysis rely on different producers having distinct isotopic ratios to trace energy and nutrient transfer to consumers. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are the usual elements analysed. We tested the hypothesis that producers unable to be separated using C and N would be separated by sulphur (S), by reviewing estuarine and marine food web studies using all three elements (total of 836 pairwise comparisons between producers). S had a wider range of values across all producers than C and N (S: 34.4, C: 23.3, N: 18.7parts per thousand), and a higher mean difference among producers (S: 9.3, C: 6.5, N: 3.3parts per thousand). We varied from 1 to 10parts per thousand the distance producers must be apart to be considered separate. For each of these gap distances, S-separated producers tied on C and N in 40% or more of cases. Comparing the three elements individually, S had fewer tied pairs of producers for any gap distance than C or N. However, S also has higher within-producer variability. Statistical tests on simulated data showed that this higher variability caused S to be less effective than C for analysing differences among mean producer values, yet mixing models showed that S had the smallest confidence intervals around mean estimates of source contributions to consumers. We also examined the spatial and temporal scales over which S isotope signatures of the saltmarsh plant Spartina alterniflora varied. Differences between samples taken within tens of metres were smallest, but between samples hundreds of metres apart were as different as samples thousands of kilometres apart. The time between samples being taken did not influence S signatures. Overall, the use of S is recommended because it has a high probability of distinguishing the contribution of different producers to aquatic food webs. When two elements are employed, the combination of S and C separates more producers than any other combination.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are abundant marine protists which play an important role in the transfer of energy in the form of organic matter and nutrients to higher trophic levels. Due to their aquatic lifestyle, factors such as water temperature, salinity and pH are key drivers controlling biomass turnover through foraminifera. In this study the influence of salinity on the feeding activity of foraminifera was tested. Two species, Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica, were collected from a mudflat in northern Germany (Friedrichskoog) and cultured in the laboratory at 20 degrees C and a light-dark cycle of 16:08 h. A lyophilized algal powder from Dunaliella tertiolecta, which was isotopically enriched with C-13 and N-15, was used as a food source. The feeding experiments were carried out at salinity levels of 11, 24 and 37 practical salinity units (PSU) and were terminated after 1, 5 and 14 d. The quantification of isotope incorporation was carried out by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Ammonia tepida exhibited a 10-fold higher food uptake compared to H. germanica. Furthermore, in A. tepida the food uptake increased with increasing salinity but not in H. germanica. Over time (from 1-5 to 14 d) food C retention increased relative to food N in A. tepida while the opposite was observed for H. germanica. This shows that if the salinity in the German Wadden Sea increases, A. tepida is predicted to exhibit a higher C and N uptake and turnover than H. germanica, with accompanying changes in C and N cycling through the foraminiferal community. The results of this study show how complex and differently food C and N processing of foraminiferal species respond to time and to environmental conditions such as salinity.

AB  - A survey of the interactions between phosphorus ( P) species and the components of calcareous soils shows that both surface reactions and precipitation take place, especially in the presence of calcite and limestone. The principal products of these reactions are dicalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate, which may interconvert after formation. The role of calcium carbonate in P retention by calcareous soils is, however, significant only at relatively high P concentrations non-carbonate clays play a more important part at lower concentrations. In the presence of iron oxide particles, occlusion of P frequently occurs in these bodies, especially with forms of the element that are pedogenic in origin. Progressive mineralization and immobilization, often biological in nature, are generally observed when P is added as a fertilizer.
   Manure serves both as a source of subsurface P and an effective mobilizing agent. Blockage of P sorption sites by organic acids, as well as complexation of exchangeable Al and Fe in the soil, are potential causes of this mobilization. Swine and chicken manure are especially rich P sources, largely due the practice of adding the element to the feed of nonruminants. Humic materials, both native and added, appear to increase recovery of Olsen P. In the presence of metal cations, strong complexes between inorganic P and humates are formed. The influence of humic soil amendments on P mobility warrants further investigation.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a commonly encountered and highly successful organism in marine ecosystems. It is a fast-growing, extremely versatile copiotroph that is active over a very broad range of conditions. It frequently occurs suspended in the water column (often attached to particles or zooplankton), and is a proficient colonist of submerged surfaces. This organism is an important pathogen of animals ranging from microcrustaceans to humans and is a causative agent of seafood-associated food poisoning. This review examines specific ecological adaptations of V. parahaemolyticus, including its broad tolerances to temperature and salinity, its utilization of a wide variety of organic carbon and energy sources, and its pervasive colonization of suspended and stationary materials that contribute to its success and ubiquity in temperate and tropical estuarine ecosystems. Several virulence-related features are examined, in particular the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH), the TDH-related hemolysin (TRH), and the type 3 secretion system, and the possible importance of these features in V. parahaemolyticus pathogenicity is explored. The impact of new and much more effective PCR primers on V. parahaemolyticus detection and our views of virulent strain abundance are also described. It is clear that strains carrying the canonical virulence genes are far more common than previously thought, which opens questions regarding the role of these genes in pathogenesis. It is also clear that virulence is an evolving feature of V. parahaemolyticus and that novel combinations of virulence factors can lead to emergent virulence in which a strain that is markedly more pathogenic evolves and propagates to produce an outbreak. The effects of global climate change on the frequency of epidemic disease, the geographic distribution of outbreaks, and the human impacts of V. parahaemolyticus are increasing and this review provides information on why this ubiquitous human pathogen has increased its footprint and its significance so dramatically.

AB  - The food sources of 14 benthic consumer species (polychaetes, bivalves, amphipods and decapods) were investigated at 2 locations in a brackish lagoon (Gamo Lagoon, Japan) using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. Consumer diets were elucidated from the delta C-13 values of food sources, including riverine and terrestrial materials (<-25.6 parts per thousand.), autochthonous particulate organic matter (POM, -23.6 parts per thousand.), the macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla (-20.4 parts per thousand), marine POM (-19.9 parts per thousand), benthic and epiphytic diatoms (-16.5 to -15 parts per thousand) and the macroalga Enteromorpha prolifera (-13.1 parts per thousand). G. vermiculophylla was distinguished from marine POM by a high 6 15 N value. Consumers showed dietary shifts on a small scale (similar to 200 m) corresponding to changes in the food supply. At the lagoon mouth (Site A) benthic diatoms were the major diet for deposit feeders with enriched delta C-13 and/or delta N-15 values. Suspension feeders also assimilated a certain amount of benthic diatoms as well as marine POM due to current induced resuspension at this site. In contrast, autochthonous POM (phytoplankton) was an important diet component in the inner lagoon (Site B-bare) where chlorophyll a concentration was high (110 to 113 mu g l(-1)). In macroalgal patches (Site B-algae), epiphytic diatoms were a major dietary component of consumers. Based on the delta C-13 range of consumers (-21.5 to -13.5 parts per thousand.), the benthic food web was primarily based on estuarine and marine microalgal production, whereas riverine and terrestrial materials were of minor importance.

AB  - Ecosystems that function as critical transition zones (CTZs) among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats are closely connected to the ecosystems adjacent to them and are characterized by a rapid flux of materials and organisms. CTZs play various roles, including mediating water flows, accumulating sediments and organic matter, processing nutrients, and providing opportunities for recreation. They are particularly difficult to manage because they tend to be small, albeit important, components of large watersheds, and managers may not have control over the entire landscape. Moreover, they are often the focus of intensive human activity. Consequently, CTZs are critically important zones, and their preservation and protection are likely to require unique collaboration among scientists, managers, and stakeholders. Scientists can learn a great deal from the study of these ecosystems, taking advantage of small size and the importance of fluxes, but a good understanding of adaptive management strategies is needed to establish a dialogue with managers and stakeholders on technical and management issues. An understanding of risk analysis is also important to help set meaningful goals and establish logical strategies that include all of the interested parties. Successful restoration of a CTZ is the best test of the quality of knowledge about its structure and function. Much has already been learned about coastal CTZs through restoration projects, and the large number of such projects involving riparian CTZs in particular suggests that there is considerable opportunity for fruitful collaborations between scientists and managers.

AB  - Metal removal by estuarine mixing has been studied for several decades, but few studies emphasize dissolved metal speciation and organic ligand complexation. Findings from the last decade indicate that metal-humic complexation can be significant for dissolved metals including Cu(II), Al(III) and Fe(III), but little consideration is given to the precipitation of these complexes with humic material at pH < 2. Given that total soluble metal analysis involves an acidification step for sample preservation, we show that Mn and other metal concentrations may have been underestimated in estuaries, especially when humic substance concentrations are high. A competitive ligand assay of selected samples from our study site, a coastal waterway bordered by wetlands (Broadkill River, DE), showed that Mn(III)-humic complexation is significant, and that some Mn (III)-L complexes precipitate during acidification. In the oxygenated surface waters of the Broadkill River, total dissolved Mn (dMnT) was up to 100% complexed to ambient ligands as Mn(III)-L, and we present evidence for humic-type Mn(III)-L complexes. The Mn(III) complexes were kinetically stabilized against Fe(II) reduction, even when [Fe(II)] was 17 times higher than [dMnT]. Unlike typical oceanic surface waters, [Fe(II)] > [Fe(III)-L] in surface waters, which may be attributed to high rates of photoreduction of Fe(III)-L complexes. Total [Mn(III)-L] ranged from 0.22 to 8.4 mu M, in excess of solid MnOx (below 0.28 mu M in all samples). Filtration of samples through 0.02 mu m filters indicated that all Mn(III)-L complexes pass through the filters and were not colloidal species in contrast to dissolved Fe. Incubation experiments indicated that the reductive dissolution of solid MnOx by ambient ligands may be responsible for Mn(III) formation in this system. Unlike previous studies of estuarine mixing, which demonstrated metal removal during mixing, we show significant export of dMn and dissolved Fe (dFe) in the summer and fall of 2015. Thus, we propose that estuarine removal should be considered seasonal for dMn and dFe, with export in the summer and fall and removal during the winter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although conventional sediment parameters (mean grain size, sorting, and skewness) and provenance have typically been used to infer sediment transport pathways, most freshwater, brackish, and marine environments are also characterized by abundant sediment constituents of biological, and possibly anthropogenic and volcanic, origin that can provide additional insight into local sedimentary processes. The biota will be spatially distributed according to its response to environmental parameters such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon content, grain size, and intensity of currents and tidal flow, whereas the presence of anthropogenic and volcanic constituents will reflect proximity to source areas and whether they are fluvially- or aerially-transported. Because each of these constituents have a unique environmental signature, they are a more precise proxy for that source area than the conventional sedimentary process indicators.
   This San Francisco Bay Coastal System study demonstrates that by applying a multi-proxy approach, the primary sites of sediment transport can be identified. Many of these sites are far from where the constituents originated, showing that sediment transport is widespread in the region. Although not often used, identifying and interpreting the distribution of naturally-occurring and allochthonous biologic, anthropogenic, and volcanic sediment constituents is a powerful tool to aid in the investigation of sediment transport pathways in other coastal systems.

AB  - Purpose Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the potential for metal (Cu, Ni and Zn) and herbicide (simazine, atrazine and diuron) release from agricultural soil and dredged sediment in managed realignment sites following tidal inundation.
   Materials and methods Column microcosm and batch sorption experiments were carried out at low (5 practical salinity units, psu) and high (20 psu) salinity to evaluate the changes in the partitioning of metals and herbicides between the soil/sediment and the aqueous phase, and the release of metals and herbicides from soil/sediment to the overlying water column.
   Results and discussion For both the metals and herbicides, the highest contaminant loads were released from the sediment within the first 24 h of inundation suggesting that any negative impacts to overlying water quality in a managed realignment scheme will be relatively short term following tidal inundation of soil and sediment. The release of metals was found to be dependent on a combination of salinity effects and the strength of binding of the metals to the soil and sediment. In the case of the herbicides, salinity impacted on their release. Particulate organic carbon was found to control the binding and release of the herbicides, highlighting the importance of assessing soil and sediment organic matter content when planning managed realignment sites.
   Conclusions Our research demonstrates that metals and herbicides may be released from contaminated sediments and agricultural soils during initial periods of flooding by seawater in managed realignment sites.

AB  - Stable isotope techniques in food web studies often focus on organic carbon in food sources which are subsequently assimilated in the tissue of consumer organisms through diet. The presence of non-dietary carbonates in bulk samples can affect their delta C-13 values, altering how their results are interpreted. Acidification of samples is a common practice to eliminate any inorganic carbon present prior to analysis. We examined the effects of pre-analysis acidification on two size fractions of sediment organic matter (SOM) from marine and freshwater wetlands and pure muscle tissue of a common freshwater invertebrate (Cherax destructor). The elemental content and isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen were compared between paired samples of acidified and control treatments. Our results showed that acidification does not affect the elemental or isotopic values of freshwater SOM. In the marine environment acidification depleted the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the fine fraction of saltmarsh and delta N-15 values of mangrove fine SOM. Whilst acidification did not change the elemental content of invertebrate muscle tissue, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were affected. We recommend to researchers considering using acidification techniques on material prepared for stable isotope analysis that a formal assessment of the effect of acidification on their particular sample type should be undertaken. Further detailed investigation to understand the impact of acidification on elemental and isotopic values of organic matter and muscular tissues is required.

AB  - The influence of microphytobenthic community on the composition of sedimentary organic matter was evaluated in two Bahia Blanca estuary microhabitats contrasting in vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions; namely, S1 located in a Sarcocornia perennis saltmarsh with macroscopic microbial mats and S2 in a mudflat without macroscopic microbial mats or vegetation. Moisture, organic matter, chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, carbohydrates (CH), proteins (PRT), and abundance and structure of microphytobenthic community were evaluated in surface sediments. Higher moisture was observed at S2 and was related to the proximity of this site to the subtidal zone and the effect of the environmental variables temperature and rain. No significant differences were found in organic matter content between sites; however, at S1, a higher concentration was registered during winter and early spring associated to the period of higher microphytobenthic biomass. Chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were higher at S1, attributed to the higher microphytobenthos abundance at this site. Differences in microphytobenthos were observed not only in quantity but also in community structure since at S1 filamentous cyanobacteria dominated the community, whereas at S2, higher abundance of centric diatoms and the absence of cyanobacteria were observed during most of the study. S1 showed higher concentration of proteins and carbohydrates which could be attributed to the higher production of fresh organic matter by microphytobenthos. The total protein and carbohydrate concentrations allowed us to classify both microhabitats into the meso-oligotrophic category, contrasting with the classification made by other authors using water column proxies.

AB  - The tidal freshwater portion of the Delaware Estuary has historically been an area of intense urban and industrial activities including dredging, point discharges, petroleum refineries, and shipyards. Multiple cores were collected in fringing marshes across from the urban area and used here to investigate historical records of these associated activities. Two cores in the most industrialized portion exhibited regular and congruent geochronology (0.6 cm/year downstream and an average of 1.2 cm/year upstream) based on both natural 210-Pb and fallout 137-Cs radionuclides. Thus, these sedimentary records should reflect sedimentary pollution histories over much of the latter past century.
   Recorded in the freshwater marsh sediment upstream is a dramatic increase in total phosphorus (TP) starting in 1950-1960, and, as in the Delaware River water, tracks the introduction of P detergent use. Although this might include increased use of P fertilizers, there is a substantial decrease after removal of the P detergent source in the mid-1970s. Carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) track P changes after 1955. The heavier carbon isotope (C-13) corresponds to higher levels of P in the sediments (and water), while the lighter carbon (C-12) isotope in recent times corresponds to decreased use or discharge of P. In more recent times since the 1970s, there is a significant relationship (p < 0.05) between delta C-13 and sediment P, while before 1965 there is a significant but different relationship. As such, the lower delta C-13 of the sediment organic matter may record decreased growth/eutrophication when P loadings and concentrations are reduced. The N stable isotope record shows a marked increase in delta N-15 (ca. 3.5 parts per thousand to 7.5 parts per thousand) starting in the early 1960s. This corresponds to a substantial increase in the concentration of dissolved nitrogen (mainly as nitrate) from population growth, fertilizer applications, or changes in the processing of wastewater leading to reduction in chemical oxygen demand.
   The industrial metals fall into at least two transient records:
   (1) The Ag, As, Co, Cd, Cr, and Co show 2- to 4-fold increases after 1950, with steady inventories over the past 20-30 years. This reflects periods of increased industrialization, followed by better sewage treatment, industrial stagnation, relict sources, or continued urban run-off from atmospheric deposition. Episodic remobilization of sedimentary inventories is not indicated in the regular geochronologies and lack of porosity change.
   (2) The Pb and Sn show similar, but a much larger (10-fold) increase after 1950. This reflects the use and then legislative controls of anthropogenic organo-metallic compounds. The lead transient peak corresponds to the use (and local manufacture) of tetra ethyl lead as a gasoline additive, but phased out starting 30 years ago. Likewise, industrial organo-tins include tri-butyl tin (TBT), anti-fouling additives used in ship bottom paints. The sustained modem levels of organo-tins indicate some continued relict inputs. The decreasing order of butyl-tin concentrations is mono- to di- to tri-butyl species, implicating degradation of TBT via trans-alkylation. This also suggests the order of product stability, rather than that of independent source loading. The conservative correlation of linear butyl tins (linear order mono -> di -> tri-) with both total and butyl-tins, also strongly implicates TBT as the unique input. Although TBT use was banned about 20 years ago, there appear to be continued sources and diagenesis of buried TBT with mobilization of butyl-tin products into the tidal Delaware Estuary.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the distribution patterns of mudsnail populations in the Evros Delta lagoons and to investigate the key environmental variables affecting them. As a correct species assignment is crucial for ecological studies, the data presented here are substantiated using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genome to verify the systematic status of the mudsnail taxon in question. A comparative molecular analysis involving almost all brackish-water taxa of Hydrobiinae indicates that the populations from the Evros Delta belong to the Pontic species Ventrosia maritima, a taxon that was not reported before from the Mediterranean. Moreover, it appears that in previous studies, the mudsnail populations from the Evros Delta were misidentified. Principal Component Analyses using environmental variables defined station groups among which V maritima showed a significant variation in density. Mudsnail specimens were absent at stations with an immediate access to the sea (salinity 32 - 34 PSU, very fine to fine sand, organic matter 0.3 -1.4 %), they showed intermediate densities (up to 3,000 ind./m(2)) in innermost lagoonal parts (34-35 PSU, very fine sand, organic matter 1.0-1.4 %) and relatively high densities (up to 7,000 ind./m(2)) only in isolated parts (15-17 PSU, fine sand, organic matter 0.5-0.8 %). Contact with the sea, which is strongly correlated with seawater renewal rate and hydrodynamism, was found to be the most important factor affecting mudsnail distributions. The data presented, being the first detailed ecological information available for V. maritima, are compared with the available information for other mudsnail taxa. The present study not only lays the foundation for future comparative eco-genetic works of mudsnail taxa, it also stresses the absolute need for the routine usage of molecular markers in ecological studies involving frequently utilized but systematically poorly understood invertebrate species.

AB  - The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) simulates fully coupled processes and interactions among water, energy, carbon and nutrient cycles. E3SM connects vegetation and soil dynamics through nutrient uptake, plant production, litterfall and decomposition as a function of abiotic parameters (e.g. temperature and moisture). However, E3SM is designed to characterize terrestrial ecosystems and connects land and open ocean systems using a single streamflow transport term, ignoring the complex dynamics of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients in coastal systems. The goals of our project were to: (1) Parameterize a point version of E3SM to capture coastal wetland habitats and (2) Determine marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated CO2. We adapted a version of the E3SM land model, previously configured to represent forested bog hydrology to a coastal ecosystem using datasets from field experiments conducted at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center?s Global Change Research Wetland (GCReW). Tidal forcing in a marsh environment was simulated using a two-column system in which the columns are connected by lateral hydrologic flows. One column simulates interactions between vegetation and soil while a second column simulates variation in water level (both tidal and sea level rise). The updated model captures many aspects of the field experiments, showing that plant community responses to environmental change are non-linear, non-additive and different between plant types. Elevated CO2 treatments increased C3 plant biomass more than C4 (33% vs 17%). Temperature exacerbated CO2 responses in C3 plants (0 ?C: 26%, 5.1 ?C: 56%). We were more successful at characterizing C3 than C4 responses and simulating above rather than belowground biomass production. Next steps will include updates to key physiological parameters such as root:shoot carbon allocation and the addition of mechanistic feedbacks between vegetation and biogeochemical processes.

AB  - Monthly samples of Streblospio shrubsolii were collected from February 1998 to February 1999 at both parts of Monolimni Lagoon (0.3 psu < Sal. < 6 psu). Streblospio shrubsolii displayed a life cycle of about one year. Reproductive activity occurred from February to October. The worms showed a mean of 14 or 16 gametogenic segments. Reproductive activity, growth and density increased during spring despite the low salinities (similar to 0.3 psu). Streblospio shrubsolii showed faster growth, larger body size during autumn-winter, more reproductive peaks, a relatively higher mean annual density, mean anual biomass (B) and annual production (P) at the innermost part of the lagoon, in organically richer very fine sand, than those at the outer part in fine sand. Mean annual density was 1,320 individuals m(-2) at the outer part and 1,745 individuals m(-2) at the innermost. Production calculated by HYNES's method gave a B of 0.20 g DW m(-2) y(-1) and P of 0.45 g DW m(-2) y(-1) at the outer part; the respective values at the innermost part were 0.29 g DW m(-2) y(-1) and 0.61 g DW m(-2) y(-1).

AB  - An unresolved question in microbial oceanography is to what extent do hetero trophic bacteria serve as a carbon (C) and nutrient source for higher trophic levels in food webs. Coastal bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) studies addressing this question have focused largely on river-dominated estuaries, but submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is also an important freshwater, nutrient, and organic matter source to coastal waters, and its effect on BGE is unknown. We assessed BGE, cell abundance, growth rates, production, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) bioavailability in surface waters inside and outside of SGD plumes at 4 sites (2 leeward and 2 windward) on Hawai'i Island. SGD effects on bacterial dynamics were greatest within windward SGD plumes, where discharge rates were highest. SGD effects were minimal within leeward plumes as their values were comparable to those in nearby ocean waters. In windward SGD plumes, BGE and cell abundance were lowest, but bacterial growth rates and DOC bioavailability were highest. Bacterial cell abundance was also inversely related to salinity, suggesting that either SGD diluted marine bacterial cells or that it had lower abundances compared to marine waters. Uncoupling of bacterial production and respiration may explain the inverse patterns observed with BGE and growth rates. Overall, low BGE (8 to 20%) in these coastal waters, especially those with high SGD, suggest that bacteria transfer only a small fraction of their consumed C to the next trophic level, and are possibly a source of CO2 to the atmosphere.

AB  - The energetic cost of plant organ construction is a functional trait that is useful for understanding carbon investment during growth (e.g. the resource acquisition vs. tissue longevity tradeoff), as well as in response to global change factors like elevated CO2 and N. Despite the enormous importance of roots and rhizomes in acquiring soil resources and responding to global change, construction costs have been studied almost exclusively in leaves. We sought to determine how construction costs of aboveground and belowground organs differed between native and introduced lineages of a geographically widely dispersed wetland plant species (Phragmites australis) under varying levels of CO2 and N. We grew plants under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2, as well as under two levels of soil nitrogen. We determined construction costs for leaves, stems, rhizomes and roots, as well as for whole plants. Across all treatment conditions, the introduced lineage of Phragmites had a 4.3% lower mean rhizome construction cost than the native. Whole-plant construction costs were also smaller for the introduced lineage, with the largest difference in sample means (3.3%) occurring under ambient conditions. In having lower rhizome and plant-scale construction costs, the introduced lineage can recoup its investment in tissue construction more quickly, enabling it to generate additional biomass with the same energetic investment. Our results suggest that introduced Phragmites has had an advantageous tissue investment strategy under historic CO2 and N levels, which has facilitated key rhizome processes, such as clonal spread. We recommend that construction costs for multiple organ types be included in future studies of plant carbon economy, especially those investigating global change.

AB  - Above- and belowground production in coastal wetlands are important contributors to carbon accumulation and ecosystem sustainability. As sea level rises, we can expect shifts to more salt-tolerant communities, which may alter these ecosystem functions and services. Although the direct influence of salinity on species-level primary production has been documented, we lack an understanding of the landscape-level response of coastal wetlands to increasing salinity. What are the indirect effects of sea-level rise, i.e., how does primary production vary across a landscape gradient of increasing salinity that incorporates changes in wetland type? This is the first study to measure both above- and belowground production in four wetland types that span an entire coastal gradient from fresh to saline wetlands. We hypothesized that increasing salinity would limit rates of primary production, and saline marshes would have lower rates of above- and belowground production than fresher marshes. However, along the Northern Gulf of Mexico Coast in Louisiana, USA, we found that aboveground production was highest in brackish marshes, compared with fresh, intermediate, and saline marshes, and belowground production was similar among all wetland types along the salinity gradient. Multiple regression analysis indicated that salinity was the only significant predictor of production, and its influence was dependent upon wetland type. We concluded that (1) salinity had a negative effect on production within wetland type, and this relationship was strongest in the fresh marsh (0-2 PSU) and (2) along the overall landscape gradient, production was maintained by mechanisms at the scale of wetland type, which were likely related to plant energetics. Regardless of wetland type, we found that belowground production was significantly greater than aboveground production. Additionally, inter-annual variation, associated with severe drought conditions, was observed exclusively for belowground production, which may be a more sensitive indicator of ecosystem health than aboveground production.

AB  - The distribution of contaminant radionuclides from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant was used to establish chronologies for three saltmarsh sediment cores from south west Scotland. delta(13)C and C-14 analyses indicated that the cores provided a useful archive record of variations in input of organic matter and carbonate. The results imply that prior to major releases of contaminant C-14 from Sellafield, the C-14 specific activity of organic matter in Irish Sea offshore sediments was about 24 Bq kg(-1) C, while that of the carbonate component was below the limit of detection. These results provide baseline data for modelling the uptake of contaminant C-14 by the Irish Sea sediment system. The study confirmed that delta(13)C analyses provide a sensitive means of apportioning the origin of saltmarsh organic matter between C-3 terrigenous plants, C-4 terrigenous plants and suspended particulate marine organic matter. For the < 2 mm fraction of sediment, a clear pattern of decreasing marine organic input was observed in response to increasing elevation of the marsh surface as a result of sediment accumulation. Bulk sediment, including detrital vegetation, had a dominant input from terrigenous plants. The combined use of delta C-13 and C-14 data revealed that organic matter in the marine organic component of the < 2 mm fraction of contemporary surface sediments of the saltmarshes is dominated by recycled old organic material.

AB  - Estuarine ecosystems are changing rapidly in response to anthropogenic impacts. Mangrove expansion in New Zealand is mainly attributed to favourable climatic conditions and increased sedimentation due to land use change. This expansion is associated with large scale shifts in ecosystem structure and function, with significant potential impacts on coastal carbon and nitrogen storage. A fundamental aspect of understanding these impacts is accurately estimating storage within above ground biomass. We developed allometric equations to estimate above ground biomass, carbon and nitrogen stocks for temperate Avicennia marina subsp. Australasica growing near the southern limit of the species distribution range in New Zealand. We compare these equations with existing equations for Avicennia spp. Tree height, trunk circumference, tree canopy volume and tree canopy area were strong predictors of total above ground biomass, carbon, and nitrogen stocks. Carbon and nitrogen stocks accounted for 41.23 +/- 0.40 % and 1.28 +/- 0.03 %, respectively, of total above ground biomass. This study is the first to develop allometric equations to estimate biomass, carbon and nitrogen stocks in temperate Avicennia marina. These equations can be used to improve assessments of the impact of changes on mangrove forest structure and function, in particular carbon and nitrogen storage.

AB  - Disturbance caused by agriculture and resource extraction has resulted in widespread homogenization of soils at the local (within-site) scale. Here, we describe how experimental manipulation of heterogeneity at the local scale has had inconsistent effects on plant species diversity. Moreover, we discuss how soil homogenization per se typically has not been accounted for in the study of heterogeneity-diversity relationships, and how disturbance, often viewed as an artifact in soil heterogeneity experiments, can be a key driver of soil homogenization. We propose a conceptual model for describing the relationship between plant size, patch size, and diversity, and we discuss how factors such as disturbance, productivity, and competition among species cither should be controlled or accounted for in soil heterogeneity-plant diversity experiments. Finally, we consider the concept of soil patch microedges, which may provide unique micrositcs for increased plant diversity, and how these biogeochemical and hydrological interfaces could potentially drive ecosystem processes in a manner unique from the adjacent patches. Overall, this synthesis integrates perspectives on the functional links between plant-driven processes, and soil patterns and processes.

AB  - Seasonal variations in the sediment porewater concentration profiles of organic and inorganic sulfur species at a Chesapeake Bay channel site provide new insight into an esturarine sulfur cycle. Oxidation of sulfide, as evidenced by the presence of zero-valent sulfur, occurs in this sulfidic sediment despite bottom water column and sediment anoxia. Thiosulfate shows a bimodal occurrence profile with a maximum in the late spring and fall, and is absent in midsummer. Two thiols, cysteine and glutathione, show maximal concentrations at 4 cm in mid-summer, which overlaps the highest gradient of sulfide and zero-valent sulfur occurrence patterns, suggesting a role in elemental sulfur redox or transport processes. Mercaptoacetate and mercaptopyruvate, were found in much lower concentrations and appear to be linked to the diagenesis of cysteine. Two mercaptopropanoic acids show temporal profiles increasing with sediment depth and may be linked to deeper sediment methanogenic bacterial activities.

AB  - Rates of sulfate reduction and the cycling of sulfur were measured in estuarine sediments vegetated with Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), and in adjacent bare sediment, in summer during the intensive period of the growth season. Sulfate reduction rates were determined along a shoot density gradient (210 to 1026 shoots m(-2)). There was a positive linear correlation between shoot density and depth-integrated sulfate reduction rates, and rates were 5-fold higher at the dense station (59.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) than at the bare site (12.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The accumulation of particulate organic matter was low in the vegetated sediments, and there was no correlation between the organic content and microbial activity. The accumulation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was higher in the vegetated sediments, whereas pools of short chain fatty acids were low (< 5 mu M) at all stations. There was a positive relationship between the depth-integrated DOC pool and sulfate reduction rates along the shoot density gradient, indicating a direct plant effect probably from a production of labile organic matter within the eelgrass bed. Sulfate reduction rates were primarily enhanced in the rooted zone. The cycling of sulfur compounds was rapid, as there was an accumulation of dissolved sulfides in the pore waters throughout the examined sediment layer (0 to 8 cm) in the vegetated sediments. Burial of precipitated reduced sulfides increased with increasing shoot density, but the pools were low when related to the sulfate reduction rates, indicating a rapid reoxidation of sulfides at the location.

AB  - In this study, five cores of the Anllns River bed sediments were analyzed in order to evaluate the downcore and downstream variations in their chemical composition. The first step was the evaluation of the metal distribution in the bulk (< 2 mm) and fine fractions (< 63 mu m). The analysis revealed that most of the metals followed the same trend in both fractions, although the fine fraction presented usually higher concentrations. However, the concentration of both fractions tended to equalize with increasing contamination. No general increase was observed in the metal concentrations toward the surface which could be attributed to recent anthropogenic contributions. Instead, the distributions were homogeneous or peaked at various depths downcore. The most important historical feature was observed at the mouth of the river, at 96-cm depth, corresponding to the end of the eighteenth century. Upcore increased metal concentrations in parallel with increased fine fraction occurred from this depth, which were attributed to a bridge construction and consequent changes in sediment dynamics. As the metal concentrations can be influenced by variations in texture or other sediment characteristics, the second step was to evaluate the efficiency of several normalized indexes in the assessment of the degree of contamination, by calculating the enrichment factor (EF), the geoaccumulation index (I (GEO)) and the pollution load index (PLI). The EFs obtained were < 10, thus revealing little anthropogenic inputs to the basin. The I (GEO) produced higher values when compared with the EFs. Instead of absolute EF or I (GEO) absolute values, the use of cumulative probability plots allowed identifying more accurately potential outliers indicating contamination. Only one population was identified for Zn and Pb, with a reduced number of outliers at the highest concentrations for Pb. As shown, a more complex plot with the outliers identified at C4 and C5. Finally, the PLI allowed determining the absence of a significant contamination in the bed sediments. The bioavailable and non-geogenic fractions contribute up to a 90% of the total concentrations in the case of As and Cu, and showed similar (dissimilar) profiles in comparison with total metals. Also, the quality guidelines were surpassed, so the high solubility of As, Zn, Pb and Ni in the sediments revealed the need to monitor the bed sediment quality of the Anllns River.

AB  - This study focused on the Shark River estuary in the central drainage of the Everglades watershed, testing whether mangrove subsidies to estuarine food webs were especially strong in south Florida sites, as suggested in pioneering studies by Odum and Heald (1975). Samples of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle L.) and filter feeding barnacles and mussels were collected in a transect from the mouth of the estuary to the freshwater end of the estuary during August 1997. Along this transect, elemental and stable isotopic compositions of green, yellow and submerged detrital mangrove leaves showed relatively constant carbon (C) compositions, while nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) compositions varied strongly. For example, mangrove N contents increased at the upper freshwater end of the Shark River estuary, and N isotopic compositions declined, probably indicating relatively N-rich inputs from the upstream Everglades watershed. In contrast, mangrove sulfur contents varied most in mid-estuary where green leaf S contents were highest and S isotopic compositions lowest. Mixing models based on S isotopes showed that mangrove swamps supported up to 60% of filter feeder nutrition at mid-estuarine stations. However, microalgal support of the filter feeders was also generally strong (40-75%) throughout the estuary. Although this study did not confirm a dominant nutritional role for mangrove detritus at most sites, results did support a second hypothesis from earlier work in this area (Odum, 1984), namely that landscape position may generally control development of mangrove-based food webs.

AB  - A great diversity of organisms modify the physical structure of estuarine and coastal environments. These physical ecosystem engineers - particularly, dune and marsh plants, mangroves, seagrasses, kelps, reef-forming corals and bivalves, burrowing crustaceans, and infauna - often have substantive functional impacts over large areas and across distinct geographic regions. Here, we use a general framework for physical ecosystem engineering to illustrate how these organisms can exert control on sedimentary processes, coastal protection, and habitat availability to other organisms. We then discuss the management implications of coastal and estuarine engineering, concluding with a brief prospectus on research and management challenges.

AB  - Epibacteria, i.e. bacteria attached to suspended particles, were studied in ponds, used for the cultivation of Northern White Shrimp (Penaeus vannamei L.), at Hai-yan Farm (Zhejiang Province, China). Four ponds with different surface area and age were used. The water temperature ranged from 24 to 32 degrees C on the sampling days. Salinity and pH values of all shrimp ponds ranged 10-20 parts per thousand and 7.8-8.4, respectively, during the experimental period, from 20 May to 20 August 2004. In this study, the numbers of suspended particles (SP), particles with bacteria attached (BP), epibacteria, i.e. bacteria attached to suspended particles only (EB), and total plate count (TPC) were determined and the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) measured. In addition, the correlation between particles, epibacteria and POC was analyzed. Results showed that the average number of SP in four shrimp ponds was 5.41 x 10(4) ml(-1), with a BP of 3.00 x 10(4) ml(-1), while the percentage of particles with bacteria attached was 55.41% of the total number of suspended particles. The EB and TPC of the four ponds were 6.33 x 10(4) per ml and 3.59 x 10(6) per ml, respectively, while the percentage of EB to TPC was only 1.76%. There were highly significantly lower counts (P < 0.01) of BP, EB and TPC for the first year culture ponds during all phases. However, there was no significant difference (P > 0.01) for POC between the four shrimp ponds. The number of particles to which one, two, three or four bacteria were attached was 46%, 22%, 14% and 9%, respectively, of the total number of particles with bacteria attached. However, the percentage of particles with more than four bacteria attach was only 9%. There was a significant correlation between the number of epibacteria and particles with bacteria attached (r = 0.9920, n = 36; P < 0.01). The number of epibacteria was also correlated with the number of suspended particles (SP) (r = 0.9558, n = 36; P < 0.01) and the total number of bacteria (TPC) (r = 0.8657, n = 36; P < 0.01), but was not correlated with POC (r = 0.1340, n = 36; P > 0.05).

AB  - Standing dead plant litter of emergent macrophytes often forms a considerable portion of the detrital mass in wetland habitats. We examined the effects of varying environmental conditions on the diel respiratory activity (rate of CO2 evolution] of microbial assemblages associated with standing dead Litter of the emergent macrophyte Juncus effusus L. from a small freshwater wetland in central Alabama, USA. Availability of water was a major factor affecting rates of respiration in standing litter. Under field conditions, rates of CO2 evolution from plant litter fluctuated greatly, with the highest rates occurring at night and in the early morning hours, coinciding with increasing relative humidity (>90%) and plant litter water potentials (>-1.0 MPa). Rates ranged from 2 to 285 mu g CO2-Cg(-1) organic mass h(-1) over 24 h. Daily CO2 flux from microbial decomposers inhabiting standing litter ranged between 1.37 and 3.35 g C m(-2) d(-1). After controlled laboratory additions of water, rates of CO2 evolution from standing litter increased significantly, with sustained maximal rates occurring within 5 min after being wetted (>100 mu g CO2-Cg(-1) organic mass h(-1)). Results of these investigations establish that J. effusus litter is colonized by active microbial decomposers while in the standing dead phase. Furthermore, these microbial assemblages make significant contributions to ecosystem metabolism and may represent an important CO2 output not previously recognized or incorporated in estimates of CO2 flux from wetland habitats.

AB  - Sedimentation rates in constructed wetlands in northeastern Illinois, USA, ranged from 5.9 to 12.8 kg m(-2) y(-1) in 1989-1990, higher than expected based on concentrations of suspended sediment in influent waters of the wetlands. This predicted an accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 cm/y. Rates were significantly lower in 1991 growing season, ranging from 1.2 to 4.2 kg m(-2) y(-1). Factors contributing to the high sedimentation included internal autochthonous production of organic matter and resuspension. Low- and high-flow hydrologic conditions had little effect on sedimentation from 1989-90 but sedimentation was higher in the high-flow wetlands in the 1991 growing season. Deposition was a function of hydrologic loading near the water inflows; no differences were evident further downstream in the basins. Deposition rates and organic and phosphorus concentrations of the sediments increased through the growing season in conjunction with higher sediment concentrations in the inflow water. The patchy nature of vegetation density within the experimental wetlands created channelized flow, resulting in spatial variability in sediment deposition.

AB  - Nutrient biogeochemistry associated with the early stages of soil development in deltaic floodplains has not been well defined. Such a model should follow classic patterns of soil nutrient pools described for alluvial ecosystems that are dominated by mineral matter high in phosphorus and low in carbon and nitrogen. A contrast with classic models of soil development is the anthropogenically enriched high nitrate conditions due to agricultural fertilization in upstream watersheds. Here we determine if short-term patterns of soil chemistry and dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes along the emerging Wax Lake delta (WLD) chronosequence are consistent with conceptual models of long-term nutrient availability described for other ecosystems. We add a low nitrate treatment more typical of historic delta development to evaluate the role of nitrate enrichment in determining the net dinitrogen (N-2) flux. Throughout the 35-year chronosequence, soil nitrogen and organic matter content significantly increased by an order of magnitude, whereas phosphorus exhibited a less pronounced increase. Under ambient nitrate concentrations (> 60 mu M), mean net N-2 fluxes (157.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) indicated greater rates of gross denitrification than gross nitrogen fixation; however, under low nitrate concentrations (< 2 mu M), soils switched from net denitrification to net nitrogen fixation (-74.5 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)). As soils in the WLD aged, the subsequent increase in organic matter stimulated net N-2, oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite fluxes producing greater fluxes in more mature soils. In conclusion, soil nitrogen and carbon accumulation along an emerging delta chronosequence largely coincide with classic patterns of soil development described for alluvial floodplains, and substrate age together with ambient nitrogen availability can be used to predict net N-2 fluxes during early delta evolution.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen mineralization were determined along a transect from a mangrove forest to a seagrass meadow in the Bangrong area, Phuket Island, Thailand. Vertical sediment profiles of carbon oxidation were measured as sulfate reduction rates (SRR) using the S-35 technique and by monitoring net TCO2 and DOC production and Fe(III) reduction using anaerobic sediment incubations ('jar' technique). Nitrogen transformations were measured simultaneously as net NH4+ and DON production. In addition, total benthic metabolism and net nitrogen exchange were determined as fluxes of O-2, TCO2, DOC, and DIN (NO3- and NH4+) across the sediment-water interface. Rates of carbon and nitrogen transformations in this vascular-plant (high C:N)-dominated area were low compared with areas fuelled by detritus of marine origin (low C:N). It appears that the high content of structural biopolymers (e.g. lignocelluloses) hampers microbial activity. Suboxic respiration with Fe(III) as electron acceptor accounted for 70 to 80% of the total carbon oxidation in the rooted mangrove forest sediment, whereas SRR and aerobic respiration were responsible for about 20 and <6%, respectively The role of SRR decreased to about 10 % and aerobic respiration increased to 45-65 % in an adjacent bioturbated mudflat, while Fe(III) respiration decreased to 30-40 %. At the sand flat and seagrass meadow outside the mangrove forest, Fe(III) respiration only accounted for 15 and similar to 0%, respectively, whereas SRR was responsible for 20 to 45 % of the total carbon oxidation. However, the most important electron acceptor in the area outside was oxygen (55 to 75 %). The shift in dominance of electron accepters along the transect is primarily related to the presence of roots and infauna, but the sediment composition (e.g. grain size, organic content and iron content) is believed to be an important co-factor. The net production of ammonium in the sediment was not balanced by fluxes of DIN across the sediment-water interface. The missing nitrogen was assigned to a rapid and efficient bacterial ammonium assimilation at the sediment surface as indicated by ammonium turnover times of about 1 d.

AB  - Laboratory microcosms were used to investigate rates of S movement into and out of sediments and factors affecting its net retention and speciation. Rates of sulfate reduction, calculated from movement of S-35 into and out of the sediments, were much higher than net rates of sulfate movement into the sediments. Results suggested that high rates of sulfide oxidation accompanied high rates of sulfate reduction; net flux across the interface depended on the balance between these two processes. Both pyrite and acid-volatile sulfides were dynamic pools undergoing rapid formation and oxidation. Measurement of S in fulvic acid, humic acid, and humin fractions revealed differences between organic S formed by algae and that resulting from sulfate reduction and subsequent reactions in sediments; sulfate esters formed by algae were hydrolyzed in hot acid to a greater extent than sulfate esters formed with in the sediments. The organic S species also reflected the extent of oxygenation of the overlying water; low oxygen in overlying water resulted in a high sulfate ester content in the humic acid fraction. Addition of Fe to sediments did not cause increased S retention, but did lead to greater formation of pyrite relative to iron monosulfides.

AB  - The coastal zone is treated as an integrated physical system extending from the upper limit of the watershed on the landward side to the identifiable downstream limit of the shelf sea plume on the seaward side. Emergent spatial properties of the system are identified, which define a chain of segments representing a transect through the coastal zone. The integrated chemical and biological properties of individual segments are described by the net system metabolism, the ratio of gross primary production and gross respiration. Changes in net metabolism along the coastal zone transect are driven by physical flushing of the segments and allochthonous carbon and nutrient loadings. Flushing interacts with chemistry and biology by competing with heterotrophic processes for the dissolved and particulate products of autotrophic processes. Thus, the net metabolic response of a segment to allochthonous loading will be governed by the rate of flushing. One outcome of the review is the conclusion that coastal zone managers should be as, or even more concerned about particulate and dissolved organic matter loadings to the environment as they have been in the past about dissolved inorganic nutrient loadings.

AB  - Clonal integration, i.e., resource sharing within clones, enables clonal plants to maintain biomass production when ramets (asexual individuals) under stress are connected to those not under stress. Oil pollution can strongly reduce biomass production, and connected ramets within clones may experience different levels of oil pollution. Therefore, clonal integration may help plants maintain biomass production despite oil pollution. Because biomass production is often negatively correlated with greenhouse gas emissions, we hypothesized that oil pollution would increase greenhouse gas emissions and that clonal integration would reduce such an effect. We tested these hypotheses in a coastal wetland dominated by the rhizomatous grass Phragmites austraits near a major site of oil production in the Yellow River Delta in China. We applied 0, 5, or 10 mm crude oil per year for two years in plots within stands of P. austrafis and tested effects of severing rhizomes connecting ramets inside and outside a plot (i.e. preventing clonal integration) on biomass production, soil chemistry and greenhouse gas emissions. When severed, ramets inside plots with no added oil produced about 220 g aboveground biomass m(-2) over the second growing season, and plots absorbed about 500 g total CO2 equivalents m(-2). Adding 10 mm oil per year reduced aboveground biomass by about 30%, and caused plots to emit about 800 g CO2 equivalents m(-2). Leaving ramets connected to those outside plots eliminated the negative effects of oil pollution on biomass production, and caused plots given 10 mm oil per year to emit about 50% fewer total CO2 equivalents. We conclude that oil pollution can increase greenhouse gas emissions and clonal integration can reduce the effect of oil pollution on biomass production and greenhouse gas emissions. Our study provides the first experimental evidence that clonal integration in plants can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relative importance of environmental variables for Spartina alterniflora distribution was investigated across different spatial scales using maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt), a species distribution modelling technique. The results showed that elevation was the most important predictor for species presence at each scale. Mean diurnal temperature range and isothermality were the second most important predictors at national and regional scales respectively. Soil drainage class, pH and organic carbon were important on the northern Chinese coast. The importance of climatic variable type was highest at global and national scales and declined as the scale decreased. The importance of soil variable type was lower at coarser scales, but varied greatly at finer scales. The relationships between environmental variables and species presence changed as the variables' ranges changed across different scales. Climatic and soil variables were substantially affected by interactions among variables, which changed their relationships with species presence and relative importance. The modelled suitable area on the Chinese coast decreased from 54.16 to 12.64% limited by elevation from the global to national scale, and decreased to 8.04% limited by soil drainage, pH and organic carbon from the national to regional scale. The findings of the present study emphasise the importance of spatial scale for understanding relationships between environmental variables and the presence of S. alterniflora.

AB  - Soil samples from 0 to 100 cm depth were collected in four sampling sites (Sites A, B, C and D) along a 250-m length of sampling zone from the Yellow River channel to a tidal creek in a seasonal flooding wetland of the Yellow River Delta of China in fall of 2007 and spring of 2008 to investigate spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of total phosphorous (TP) and available phosphorus (AP) and their influencing factors. Our results showed that TP contents in spring and AP contents in both seasons in surface soils increased with increasing distances away from the Yellow River channel. TP contents in surface soils (0-10 cm) followed the order Site A (698.6 mg/kg) > Site B (688.0 mg/kg) > Site C (638.8 mg/kg) > Site D (599.2 mg/kg) in fall, while Site C (699.6 mg/kg) > Site D (651.7 mg/kg) > Site B (593.6 mg/kg) > Site A (577.5 mg/kg) in spring. Generally, lower TP content (630.6 mg/kg) and higher AP level (6.2 mg/kg) in surface soils were observed in spring compared to fall (656.2 mg/kg for TP and 5.2 mg/kg for AP). Both TP and AP exhibited similar profile distribution patterns and decreased with depth along soil profiles with one or two accumulation peaks at the depth of 40-80 cm. Although the mean TP content in soil profiles was slightly higher in spring (635.7 mg/kg) than that in fall (628.0 mg/kg), the mean TP stock was obviously lower in spring (959.9 g/m(2)) with an obvious accumulation at the 60-80 cm soil depth compared to fall (1124.6 g/m(2)). Topsoil concentration factors also indicated that TP and AP had shallower distribution in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that AP had significant and positive correlation with these soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, total nitrogen and Al (p < 0.01), but TP was just significantly correlated with TN and Al (p < 0.05).

AB  - The methane emitted from freshwater marsh is the difference between the production and oxidation of CH4 which reaches the atmosphere via diffusion, ebullition, or by passage through aerenchymous tissues of higher plants. To evaluate the variation of CH4 emission and the effects of increased exogenous N on CH4 emission, we have raised in situ the exogenous N with the rates of 0 g N m(-2) (control), 6 g N m(-2) (low nitrogen level), 12 g N m(-2) (medial nitrogen level) and 24 g N m(-2) (high nitrogen level), respectively, in Sanjiang Plain marsh ecosystem Northeast China. CH4 emissions were measured using the static chamber and gas chromatogram techniques. The daily average CH4 emission during the different growing stages from the marsh varies from -0.06 to 13.54mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) with the daily observation. The exogenous N significantly increased the mean seasonal CH4 emission rate by 181% (low nitrogen level, P<0.01), 254% (medial nitrogen level, P<0.01) and 155% (high nitrogen level, P<0.01), respectively. The effects of exogenous N strongly interacted with the plant aboveground biomass, which was a variable explaining most variation in CH4 emission. We also find the net effect of exogenous N on CH4 emission from freshwater marshes most likely depends on the counterbalance between the N-induced increases in CH4 production and oxidation, as a N excess may result in the inhibition of CH4 emission, and in the stimulation of CH4 emission.

AB  - In this study, we examine the distribution and carbon stable isotope signature of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and humic substances (HS) along a salinity gradient in the Altamaha and Satilla River estuaries. The maximum DOC concentrations in the Altamaha and Satilta were 10 and 29 mg Cl-1, respectively, though concentrations were similar at the mouth of both estuaries. There was a decrease in HS content of DOC from 50 to 80% at the head of the estuaries to 10% at salinities higher than 30%.. The delta(13)C DOC varied between -25.5 and -19parts per thousand and between -27 and -21%o in the Altamaha and Satilla estuaries, respectively. The tendency towards more depleted delta(13)C DOC in the Satilla, especially in the lower salinity portion of this estuary, suggests greater terrestrial inputs in the Satilla. than in the Altamaha. Seasonal fluctuations were observed in the form of increased (two to three times) range in DOC concentration, heavier 813C DOC and increased proportion of estuarine marine-derived DOC (average enrichment of delta(13)C DOC from + 1 to 4- 2) during low river flow (July-October). The delta(13)C HS in both rivers showed a similar trend, but was consistently more depleted than DOC, with an average range from -28 to -24.5parts per thousand. This suggests that HS have larger proportions of terrestrial components (a maximum of >60% at the mouth of the estuary) than DOC. The less depleted delta(13)C values of DOC in comparison with HS indicate a different source for the non-humic (non-HS) component of DOC (range in delta(13)C non-HS, -22 to -16parts per thousand). That source could either be the decomposition of detrital material derived from saltmarsh environments or microalgalderived DOC of estuarine or marine origins. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The leakage of urea, ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon from Zostera marina root-rhizomes during different porewater extractions was examined. in addition, the concentrations of these compounds were measured in root-rhizomes to estimate the potential leakage from root-rhizomes during sediment handling. The concentrations of ammonium, urea, and dissolved organic nitrogen in root-rhizomes were 22 to 51 times higher than the respective average porewater concentrations within the upper 5 cm of the sediment. Up to 70 % of the compounds in question leaked from root-rhizomes during sediment handling, with a resultant, up to 8-fold, increase in the respective porewater concentrations. The porewater concentrations of ammonium, urea, and dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon were on average overestimated by a factor of 2 within the upper 5 cm of the sediment due to leakage from root-rhizomes. Thus, it is recommended that roots and rhizomes are removed from the sediment before porewater extraction by conventional methods.

AB  - We performed two litter decomposition experiments using nearly-senesced red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) leaves collected from an Everglades dwarf mangrove wetland to understand the short-term (3 weeks) and long-term (1 year) changes in mass, as well as C-, N-, and P-content of decomposing leaf litter. We expected that leaves decomposing in this oligotrophic environment would be short-term sources of C, N, and P, but potential long-term sinks for N and P In May 1998, we conducted a 3-week leaching experiment, incubating fresh, individual leaves in seawater for up to 21 days. From May 1997 to May 1998, leaf litter in mesh bags decomposed on the forest floor at two dwarf mangrove sites. Leaching accounted for about 33% loss of dry mass from R. mangle leaves after 3 weeks. Leaching losses were rapid, peaking by day 2, and large, with leachate concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and total phosphorus (TP) increasing by more than an order of magnitude after 3 weeks. Mean leaf C:N increased from 105 to 115 and N:P increased from a mean of 74 to 95 after 21 days, reflecting the relatively large leaching losses of N and P. Loss of mass in the litterbags leveled off after 4 months, with roughly 60%dry mass remaining (DMR) after nearly 1 year of decomposition. The mass of carbon in each litterbag declined significantly after 361 days, but the mass of nitrogen and phosphorus doubled, indicating long-term accumulation of these constituents into the detritus. Subsequently, the leaf C:N ratio dropped significantly from 90 to 34 after 361 days. Following an initial 44-day increase, leaf N:P decreased from 222 to 144, reflecting high accumulation of P relative to N. A review of several estuarine macrophyte decomposition studies reveals a trend in nitrogen accumulation through time regardless of site, but suggests no clear pattern for C and P. We believe that the increase in litter P observed in this study was indicative of the P-limited status of the greater Everglades ecosystem and that decomposing mangrove litter may represent a substantial phosphorus pool in the system.

AB  - The subterranean estuary (STE), the subsurface mixing zone of outflowing fresh groundwater and infiltrating seawater, is an area of extensive geochemical reactions that determine the composition of groundwater that flows into coastal environments. This study examined the porewater composition of a shallow STE (< 5 m depth) in Gloucester Point, VA (USA) over two years to determine seasonal variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the reduced metabolites Fe, Mn, and sulfide. An additional aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of salinity gradients (which have great geochemical influence in surface estuaries) versus redox gradients on STE geochemistry. Two freshwater endmembers were identified, between which redox potential and composition varied with depth-a shallow freshwater endmember was oxidizing and high in DOC, whereas a deep freshwater endmember was reducing, lower in DOC, and high in sulfide. Results showed that dissolved Fe, Mn, and sulfide varied along a redox gradient distinct from the salinity gradient, and that three-endmember mixing was required to quantify non-conservative chemical addition/removal in the STE. In addition to salinity, humic carbon was used as a quasi-conservative tracer to quantify mixing according to a three-endmember model. The vertical distributions of DOC and reduced metabolites remained approximately constant over time, but concentrations varied with season. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were greatest in the summer, and shallow meteoric groundwater supplied the majority of DOC to the STE. In summer, there was additional evidence for shallow non-conservative addition of DOC. Dissolved Fe and Mn were highest in a subsurface plume through the middle of the STE (100-140 cm below sediment surface at the high tide line) which was characterized by higher concentrations and greater non-conservative addition in the winter. In contrast, sulfide was higher in summer at depths within the Fe and Mn plume (100-140 cm). We attribute the contrasting seasonal patterns of dissolved Fe, Mn, and sulfide to differences in microbial response to temperature changes and organic matter availability, and to competition at the ferrous-sulfidic transition zone between dissimilatory metal reduction and sulfate reduction, leading to sulfate/sulfur reducing bacteria (SRB) being more active in summer and metal reducers being more active in winter. Throughout the STE, seasonal temperature and DOC variations determined the spatial distribution and geochemical cycling of Fe, Mn, and sulfur. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concentration of trace metals (Co, Cr, Zn, Cu, and Pb), major elements (Al, Mn, Fe, Ca, Mg, and K), along with the percentage of sediment components (sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon), was determined in three sediment cores, collected from intertidal regions of the Zuari estuary (ZA and ZR) and Cumbharjua canal (CB). The Cores CB and ZR, collected from the upper middle estuarine environment, showed higher values of finer fractions and total organic carbon as well as metals (except of Ca) than Core ZA, which was sampled from the lower estuarine environment. The concentration of trace metals including Mn and Fe was found to be largely dependent on the proximity to mining areas, with Core ZR and Core CB representing the highest metal concentrations (Mn, Fe, Cr, and Zn). Absence of a significant early diagenetic remobilization might have preserved the metal loadings due to mining and industrial activities in Cores ZR and CB. In Core ZA, all the elements except Cu showed significant enrichment in the upper portion. Enrichment factor computed in all the cores was found to be above 2 for all the studied metals except Zn, which suggests a high degree of metal contamination. All these observations indicate that the present study area is under the strong influence of anthropogenic activities, especially in recent years.

AB  - The introduction of invasive Spartina grasses (C-4 plant) into previously C-3-dominated saltmarshes of western Europe complicates the reconstruction of past relative sea-level (RSL) using sediment geochemistry-based approaches. We apply a Bayesian mixing model (SIAR - Stable Isotope Analysis in R) to identify organic carbon (C-org) source contributions to saltmarsh sediment and correct delta C-13 values for the contaminating influence of C-4 vegetation. We first assess the performance of SIAR by simulation, producing synthetic saltmarsh sediment samples with variable contributions from three organic matter sources (C-3 plants, C-4 plants and particulate organic matter (POM)) and then comparing these known contributions to those determined by SIAR. For each source type, SIAR 68% credible intervals include true source contribution in 70% of calculations (n = 60) and all three sources were incorporated within credible intervals for 45% of sediment samples (n = 20). SIAR improves the mean absolute error of source contribution predictions by up to 26% compared to a conventional ternary mixing model approach. We then apply SIAR to real sediment samples recovered along transects spanning the intertidal zones at two contrasting saltmarshes in the inner and outer Shannon estuary, western Ireland. SIAR identified decreasing Corg contributions from POM with increasing elevation in the intertidal zone, reflecting differences in tidal inundation with height. Sediment delta C-13 values across the intertidal zones varied by 4.4 parts per thousand in the inner estuary and 9.4 parts per thousand in the outer estuary. Removal of the invasive C-4 signatures reduced these differences to 0.5 parts per thousand and to 2.4 parts per thousand in the inner and outer estuary, respectively, with the larger range due to increased deposition of marine POM. Although subtle, when used in combination with additional proxies, these geochemical gradients can assist in RSL reconstruction. This will be most effective when POM from marine sources is a significant carbon source.

AB  - Temporal and spatial changes in the molecular operational taxonomic unit (OTU) compositions of bacteria harboring genes for nitrification and denitrification were assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), clone-based DNA sequencing of selected PCR products, and analyses of ammonium and organic matter concentrations. Sediment, overlying water, and pore-water samples were taken from different vegetated sites of Jug Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Maryland, during spring, summer, and fall 2006. OTU richness and the diversities of nitrifiers and denitrifiers were assessed by the presence of bands on DGGE gels, both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were seasonally dependent. AOB OTU richness was highest in the summer when NOB richness was decreased, whereas NOB richness was highest in the spring when AOB richness was decreased. The OTU diversities of nitrifiers did not correlate with ammonium concentrations, organic matter concentrations, or the presence of vegetation. The OTU diversities of denitrifiers possessing either the nirK or nosZ genes were not seasonally dependent but were positively correlated with organic matter content (p = 0.0015, r(2) = 0.27; p < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.39, respectively). Additionally, the presence of vegetation significantly enhanced nosZ species richness (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.008), but this trend was not seen for nirK OTU richness. Banding patterns for nirK OTUs were more similar within sites for each season compared with any of the other genes. Over all seasons, nirK OTU richness was highest and AOB and nosZ OTU richness were lowest (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.0001). High levels of sequence divergence among cloned nirK PCR products indicate a broad diversity of nirK homologs in this freshwater estuary.

AB  - Tropical rivers provide about 60% of the global transport of organic and inorganic carbon from continents to the coastal zone. These inputs combine with organic material from productive mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs to make tropical coastal ecosystems important components in the global carbon cycle. Carbon exchange has been measured over multiple spatial scales, ranging from the transport and fate of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal zone, export of organic matter to the open ocean, exchange of leaf litter between mangroves and adjacent seagrass beds, to movement of carbon (at a scale of meters) between adjacent saltmarsh and mangrove habitats. Carbon is exchanged directly as particulate or dissolved material, or through migration of animals or through a series of predator-prey interactions known as trophic relay. This chapter first examines riverine carbon inputs to the tropical coastal zone, and how this material is processed in estuaries. The mechanisms and extent of carbon exchange among tropical coastal ecosystems are then discussed, showing their importance in ecosystem carbon budgets, and the implications for faunal and microbial communities.

AB  - The impact of temperature (0-80 degrees C) on anaerobic biogeochemical processes and prokaryotic communities in marine sediments (tidal flat) was investigated in slurries for up to 100 days. Temperature had a non-linear effect on biogeochemistry and prokaryotes with rapid changes over small temperature intervals. Some activities (e.g. methanogenesis) had multiple 'windows' within a large temperature range (similar to 10 to 80 degrees C). Others, including acetate oxidation, had maximum activities within a temperature zone, which varied with electron acceptor [metal oxide (up to similar to 34 degrees C) and sulphate (up to similar to 50 degrees C)]. Substrates for sulphate reduction changed from predominantly acetate below, and H-2 above, a 43 degrees C critical temperature, along with changes in activation energies and types of sulphate-reducing Bacteria. Above similar to 43 degrees C, methylamine metabolism ceased with changes in methanogen types and increased acetate concentrations (>1mM). Abundances of uncultured Archaea, characteristic of deep marine sediments (e.g. MBGD Euryarchaeota, 'Bathyarchaeota') changed, indicating their possible metabolic activity and temperature range. Bacterial cell numbers were consistently higher than archaeal cells and both decreased above similar to 15 degrees C. Substrate addition stimulated activities, widened some activity temperature ranges (methanogenesis) and increased bacterial (x10) more than archaeal cell numbers. Hence, additional organic matter input from climate-related eutrophication may amplify the impact of temperature increases on sedimentary biogeochemistry.

AB  - Fertilizer use in agricultural lands and treated wastewater disposal have increased bioavailable nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading to wetlands and aquatic systems with potential implications for nutrient cycling and soil microbial processes. Recently, conflicting results of N loading impacts on microbial mediated organic matter decomposition in coastal wetland soils have been reported. However, to date, the majority of studies have investigated short-term nutrient loading effects while few have reported long-term integrated impacts. Here, we present results from an 11-year soil nutrient loading study in an oligohaline coastal wetland treated with 0, 50, 200, or 1200 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in combination with 0 or 131 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). We measured soil (0-10 cm) physiochemical characteristics, soil microbial biomass N, and measures of biogeochemical cycling of N, including potentially mineralizable nitrogen and denitrification rates. Our results show that soil total P increased with P additions, but no significant differences in measures of soil microbial biomass or activity occurred with N, P, or N x P loading. We conclude that long-term N loading at rates equivalent to Mississippi River diversions had no persistent lasting effects on total N or examined soil microbial measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Neotropical grass-feeding spittlebugs of several genera are important pests of pasture grasses from the southeastern USA to northern Argentina, and of sugarcane from southern Mexico to southern Brazil, causing estimated reductions of up to 70% in yield and estimated monetary losses of US $840-2100 million annually. With few exceptions, the species badly damaged by these spittlebugs are introduced C, grasses that exhibit associative nitrogen fixation. This study synthesizes evidence that the pest status of many tropical and subtropical grass-feeding spittlebugs is linked to associative N-fixation in their C-4 hosts. Recognition that associative N-fixation is a major factor in spittlebug host preferences should deepen understanding of spittlebug agricultural ecology and facilitate efforts to combat spittlebug pests. In particular, spittlebugs should be susceptible to manipulation of xylem transport solutes. However, reduction of nitrate fertilizer rates, increase in ammonium fertilizer rates, or enhancement of associative N-fixation as a consequence of genetic engineering could make hosts more susceptible to spittlebug attack. Because of their predilection for C-4 grasses, spittlebugs present a clear counterexample to the hypothesis that herbivores prefer C-3 plants to C-4 plants. Finally, it appears that declines in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during recent geological history promoted the proliferation of C-4 grasses. This, compounded by human agricultural activities, has driven an ecological and evolutionary radiation of grass-feeding spittlebugs that presents continuing opportunities for the evolution of spittlebug pests.

AB  - Saline wetlands are rare ecosystems in Saharan areas, which are important for conservation of many endemic and rare plant species. In this study, we investigated five saline wetland sites of the Oued Righ region, located in the northeastern Algeria, to determine the environmental factors controlling the composition and distribution of plant communities. We established a total of 20 transects to measure the vegetation parameters (density and cover) and soil characteristics (electrical conductivity, moisture, pH, CaSO4, CaCO3, organic matter, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, SO4 (2-), Cl-, NO3 (-) and HCO3 (-)). A total of 17 plant species belonging to seven families were identified. The natural vegetation was composed of halophytic and hydro-halophytic plant communities, presented specially by the species of Amaranthaceae family. Soils in the studied wetlands were moist, gypsiferous, alkaline, salty to very salty with dominance of chloride and calcium. Results of the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that community structure and species distribution patterns of vegetation were mainly dependent on soil characteristics, mainly being soil salinity (CaSO4, K+, Ca2+ and Cl-) and moisture. The distribution of plant species was found to follow a specific zonal pattern. Halocnemum strobilaceum was observed to grow in highly salt-affected soils, thus being the more salt-tolerant species. Phragmites communis plants were widely distributed in the study area with a high density at the edges of accumulated water body. Juncus maritimus, Tamarix gallica and Salicornia fructicosa grew in soils that are partially or completely flooded in winter. Suaeda fructicosa, Traganum nudatum, Arthrocnemum glaucum, Aeluropus littoralis, Cressa cretica and Cynodon dactylon were distributed in salty and moist soils away from the open water body. Plants of Zygophyllum album, Limonastrirum guyonianum, Cornulaca monacantha, Cistanche tinctoria, Mollugo nudicaulis and Sonchus maritimus were found in soils with less salty and moisture. They constituted the outermost belt of vegetation in the studied wetlands. This study will provide a reference on introducing the salt-tolerant plant species as a fodder resource in saline habitats and regenerating the degraded saline wetlands.

AB  - Decomposition and microbial utilization of leaf material was investigated in micro- and mesocosm experiments using freshly sloughed leaves of a common Mediterranean seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa). In the initial phase of decomposition, dissolved monomeric carbohydrates (MCHO) leached out of the material provoking a rapid (within 40 h) response of the free-living bacterial community. When abiotic leaching had ceased after ca 180 h, 13 mg MCHO-C g-1 (leaf dry wt) had been lost from the material, 92% of which was taken up by microorganisms. At the advanced stage of decomposition, a rich nanoflagellate community had developed and after 14 d of incubation a free-living flagellate standing stock of 210-mu-g C per g (leaf dry wt) was still living at the expense of decomposing leaf material. In a long-term experiment using litter bags, the microbial colonization pattern and the breakdown of leaf tissue were followed under reduced influence of macrofaunal shredders and physical forces. The initially uniform bacterial coverage on leaf surfaces, as followed by SEM, changed within 14 d to a 7 times more abundant and heterogenous bacterial assemblage. After more than 3 wk, leaf surfaces began to break down as indicated by crevices densely surrounded by bacteria. At the same time a protozoan community, mainly consisting of monads and choanoflagellates, developed on leaf blades, reaching a maximum density of 2.4 X 10(5) cells cm-2 after 2 mo of degradation. Specific loss rates of weight, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen from litterbags were highest during the first 2 mo and declined thereafter to rates 5 times lower. Only 50% of the original dry wt and organic carbon remained after 7 to 8 mo of incubation. Measurements of the O2 consumption associated with decaying leaf material indicated that 40% of the calculated C-mineralization rate can be attributed to the decreasing organic C-concentration in the plant litter during the first 2 mo. In a later stage of decomposition, only 4% of the O2 consumption could be matched by the organic C-loss of the decomposing material; dissolved organic material also in the surrounding water is proposed to be utilized by the attached microbes. It is concluded that the soluble fraction leaching out of the material in the early phase of decay is rapidly used by both the free-living and the attached bacterial community, thus supporting a microbial food web up to the protozoan level. It is suggested that most of the residual fraction of organic carbon of leaf debris is released more slowly into the water after hydrolysis by attached microbes thus indicating a loose hydrolysis-uptake coupling. Under exclusion of shredders and reduction of physical forces degradation was not complete after 231 d of incubation. Leaf debris of C. nodosa is suggested to have a small but significant impact on microbial secondary production in the study area largely via its leachates.

AB  - Juveniles of commercially important fish species congregate in shallow vegetated estuarine habitats during high tides. Considerable debate has centred on whether the significance of these habitats lies in their provision of greater feeding opportunities, or shelter from predation afforded by greater structural complexity. We tested the hypothesis that an inundated mangrove and saltmarsh wetland provided feeding opportunities for itinerant species, and that the contribution of wetland primary producers and grazing herbivores could be identified in their diet, using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Potential sources of dietary carbon included mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass, seagrass epiphytic material and benthic organic material. Saltmarsh plants (mostly Sporobolus virginicus and Juncus kraussii) and fine benthic organic material appeared to be the primary sources of dietary carbon for the resident grazing herbivores in the wetlands, based on IsoSource mixing models. During high tide, species of itinerant fish enter the mangrove and, when inundated, the saltmarsh, and feed primarily on crab larvae and copepods. Fine benthic organic matter, seagrass epiphyte, and C-3 and C-4 plant materials also supplement the diet of some fish. The crab larvae therefore provide a significant source of nutrition and an important link between the intertidal wetlands and the adjacent estuarine ecosystem. The carnivorous fish Acanthopagrus australis, at the highest trophic level, hunted within or adjacent to the mangrove-saltmarsh wetland and fed on several lower-order consumers within the wetland. The present study highlights the significance of mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands as a feeding habitat for resident grazers and itinerant nekton.

AB  - The effect of seasonal inundation on the decomposition of emergent macrophyte litter (Scolochloa festucacea) was examined under experimental flooding regimes in a northern prairie marsh. Stem and leaf litter was subjected to six aboveground inundation treatments (ranging from never flooded to flooded April through October) and two belowground treatments (nonflooded and flooded April to August). Flooding increased the rate of mass loss from litter aboveground but retarded decay belowground. Aboveground, N concentration decreased and subsequently increased earlier in the longer flooded treatments, indicating that flooding decreased the time that litter remained in the leaching and immobilization phases of decay. Belowground, both flooded and nonflooded litter showed an initial rapid loss of N, but concentration and percent of original N remaining were greater in the nonflooded marsh throughout the first year. This suggested that more N was immobilized on litter under the nonflooded, more oxidizing soil conditions. Both N concentration and percent N remaining of belowground litter were greater in the flooded than the nonflooded marsh the second year, suggesting that N immobilization was enhanced after water-level drawdown. These results suggest different mechanisms by which flooding affects decomposition in different wetland environments. On the soil surface where oxygen is readily available, flooding accelerates decomposition by increasing moisture. Belowground, flooding creates anoxic conditions that slow decay. The typical hydrologic pattern in seasonally flooded prairie marshes of spring flooding followed by water-level drawdown in summer may maximize system decomposition rates by allowing rapid decomposition aboveground in standing water and by annually alleviating soil anoxia.

AB  - In tidal flat sediments, larger invertebrates often modify the sedimentary environment in a manner that causes smaller animals, such as meiofauna, to become more abundant. In other words, macrofauna can "promote" meiofauna. In summer (August) and autumn (November/early December) 2007, we investigated centimetre-scale horizontal and vertical profiles of total metazoan meiofaunal abundance and community structure around burrows of Uca lactea (De Haan, 1835) (fiddler crabs) and Scopimera globosa (De Haan, 1835) (sand bubbler crabs) on an intertidal sandflat of the Amakusa Islands, western Japan. Meiofaunal community structure changed significantly with sediment depth around burrows of U. lactea in both seasons, whereas vertical differences were less clear for S. globosa. Although no evidence was found that total meiofaunal abundance or the abundances of certain taxonomic groups were positively influenced by burrows of S. globosa, the abundance of nematodes in subsurface sediment around burrows of U. lactea was significantly higher than in controls in autumn. High concentrations of fresh organic matter had not accumulated in the sediment around burrows of either species of crab. Uca lactea, however, made its burrows in significantly finer sediment than did S. globosa. One possibility is that differences in meiofaunal distribution in sediment around the burrows of the two crabs were the result of habitat and behavioural differences between the species.

AB  - Direct gas chromatographic measurement of denitrification rates via N-2, fluxes from aquatic sediments can avoid some of the artifacts and complexities associated with indirect approaches and tracer techniques. However, measurement protocols have typically been determined based upon initial results or previous studies. We present a process-level study and simulation model for evaluating and optimizing N-2 gas flux approaches in closed chamber incubations. Experimental manipulations and simulations of both artificial and natural sediments were used to conduct sensitivity analyses of key design parameters in N-2 flux measurements. Experimental results indicated that depletion of labile organic matter during the long incubations required by common protocols (for diffusive off-gassing of porewater N-2) may result in underestimates of denitrification rates in some systems. Simulations showed that the required incubation time was primarily a function of sediment thickness. The best approach found to minimize incubation time and reduce errors was to select the minimum sediment thickness necessary to include the entire depth distribution of nitrification-denitrification for a particular sediment system. Attempts to increase measurement sensitivity and shorten incubation times by reducing the headspace thickness to 1-2 cm generally cause denitrification to be underestimated by 3-13% for gas headspaces, and up to 80% for water headspaces. However, errors were negligible with gas and water headspace thicknesses of 10 cm and 15 cm, respectively. Anaerobic cores to control for non-denitrification N-2 fluxes shortened incubation time, but introduced artifacts in sediments with extensive macrofaunal irrigation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Senescent blades from the seagrass Halodule wrightii Aschers were suspended in the water column of Laguna Madre (Texas, USA) for a period of 419 d, representing the longest seagrass decomposition study to date. The initial stage of decomposition was characterized by a rapid loss of organic matter (36 % in 24 d) attributed to leaching. A total of 76 % of the organic matter from seagrass tissues was lost by the end of the decomposition period. Of the major bulk constituents measured, neutral sugars were most abundant and accounted for 23 % of the ash-free dry wt of the initial senescent material. A complete and early loss of the cyclitol, myo-inositol, a reduction in glucose yields, and a relative enrichment in mannose were the most dynamic features of the neutral sugar fraction. An overall stability series: mannose > fucose > arabinose almost-equal-to rhamnose almost-equal-to galactose almost-equal-to xylose > glucose, reflects patterns of selective degradation of the polymers from which these sugars are derived. Soluble and ester-bound phenolic acids were lost from tissues at relatively high rates, Susceptibility of individual phenolic acids to removal from bulk tissue upon treatment with weak base correlated well to initial losses in the field. Early changes in total CuO oxidation phenol yields from H. wrightii were caused primarily by the relatively rapid loss of soluble and ester-bound phenolic acids. Therefore, we took a new approach to quantify lignin-derived phenols by subtracting soluble and ester-bound phenols from total CuO oxidation yields. When these losses were taken into account, lignin-derived phenol yields were similar from freshly senescent and highly degraded detritus. Cutin, although initially selectively preserved relative to bulk tissue, was also found at near initial yields in the highly degraded detritus. Overall, the distribution of polymeric constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and cutin) was similar in freshly senescent and highly degraded tissues suggesting that the compounds which comprise the ultrastructure of H. wrightii are degraded at similar rates. Photobleached H. wrightii blades were characterized by a much higher neutral sugar content, similar levels of cutin acids and a nearly complete absence of phenols compared to freshly senescent tissue. Photobleaching appears to be an important degradative mechanism which yields a polysaccharide-rich detritus that is devoid of the lignin signature characteristic of vascular plant tissues.

AB  - Mangrove forest productivity is normally sustained by nutrients from terrestrial runoff, with freshwater inputs driving the resulting outwelling of production, but arid mangroves lack this input. The movement of material between seagrass beds and mangroves was examined using the stable C and N isotopic composition of organisms, sediments and suspended matter in 3 seagrass-mangrove transects in the Arabian Gulf. The isotopic signal of suspended particulate material indicated a mixed origin that did not differ over a spring tide. Filter feeders showed significant C-13 enrichment along transects from mangrove forests into seagrass beds, indicating that location within a habitat had a significant effect on isotopic composition. Similarly, delta C-13 of both sediments and grazers increased sharply outside the mangrove forest, suggesting retention of mangrove carbon, although some outwelling was detected, the strength of which was site specific. The lack of freshwater-mediated nutrient inputs suggests any outwelling of mangrove ecosystem productivity must be balanced by inwelling, and isotopic signatures of both sediment grazers and filter feeders found within the mangrove forest confirmed the inwelling of seagrass production. Significant mangrove isotope signals in the tissue of juveniles of fishes commercially harvested offshore indicate ontogenetic movement of carbon. Additional biological movement of mangrove carbon through ontogenetic migration and 'trophic relay' is evidenced by the isotopic signature of juvenile and mature fish captured in waters exiting the mangrove forest, which indicated they fed on mangrove-sustained food webs. This study demonstrates tight coupling between arid mangroves and subtidal seagrass areas and implies that arid mangroves cannot be managed or replanted without consideration of connectivity to downstream systems such as seagrasses.

AB  - The present study analyzes the spatial distribution and seasonal distribution of live benthic foraminiferal communities in the estuary of Guadiana, the fourth largest river on the Iberian Peninsula, and establishes, through statistical analysis, their relationships with a series of environmental parameters. Forty-four superficial sediment samples were collected along distance-to-sea and elevation gradients in the winter and summer of 2010. Fifty-three foraminifera species were identified along the intertidal margins of the estuary. Foraminiferal distribution reflected seasonal variation of environmental factors, whose relative importance varied according to species tolerances. Elevation in relation to mean sea level appeared to be the most important parameter controlling foraminiferal distribution, probably because it combines the effects of a series of other variables (i.e. organic matter, sediment texture, pH and temperature). In the highest marsh areas, where environmental conditions approach survival thresholds, only some agglutinated species are able to survive. In the lower intertidal zone, where subaerial exposure is diminished and environmental conditions are generally less variable, more diverse faunas, mainly composed of calcareous species, prevail. During winter, when fluvial discharge peaks, agglutinated species represent more than 80% of the total individuals. In summer, when marine conditions prevail, calcareous species become more competitive, increase their densities and expand into higher marsh zones and estuarine upper reaches. In the estuary, three different foraminiferal assemblages are distinguished: i) Miliammina fusca assemblage, which dominates in unvegetated areas of the lower marsh and tidal flats of the mid-upper estuary; ii)Jadammina macrescens assemblage, which dominates in the highest marsh areas in the lower estuary; and iii) Ammonia aberdoveyensis assemblage, which dominates the areas of low marsh and tidal flats of the lower estuary.

AB  - We examined the effects of environmental conditions on the microbially mediated CO2 evolution from standing-dead litter (leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and culms) of the common reed, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., in two temperate littoral freshwater marshes. Water availability was the major factor affecting CO2 evolution rates. In the laboratory, microbial assemblages responded rapidly to controlled additions of water, with large increases in CO2 evolution occurring within five minutes after wetting of litter (e.g., leaf blades: 10-295 mug CO2-C.(g ash-free dry mass [AFDM])(-1).h(-1). Under field conditions, CO2 evolution in the absence of precipitation exhibited a pronounced diel periodicity, with the highest rates occurring during periods of increased water availability resulting from a temperature-induced rise in relative humidity (>95%) and corresponding litter water potential (>-2.0 MPa) during nighttime. For example, in October, rates of CO2 evolution over a 24-h cycle ranged from 5 to 223 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) for leaf blades and from 10 to 155 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) for leaf sheaths. Maximum rates of CO2 evolution from sheaths were consistently lower than those for leaf blades (by similar to25%), but were typically an order of magnitude higher than those observed from culm litter (e.g., 1.0-18 mug CO2-C.(g AFDM)(-1).h(-1) over a diel cycle in August) exposed to identical environmental conditions. Much of the differences in maximum CO2 evolution rates from different litter types were related (r(2) = 0.72) to differences in litter associated fungal biomass (leaf blades 34-74 mg (fry mass/g AFDM, leaf sheaths 16-67 mg dry mass/g AFDM, and culms 2-7 mg dry rnass/g AFDM), which was estimated from litter ergosterol concentrations. Based on measured stocks of standing-dead plant litter, estimated daily CO2 flux from standing-dead shoots ranged between 51 and 570 mg C/m(2) of wetland surface area. These values translate into a roughly estimated annual carbon mineralization equivalent to a mean of 8% (leaf blades), 29% (leaf sheaths), and 3% (culms) of net aboveground plant production. These data provide compelling evidence that microbial decomposition of plant litter in the aerial standing-dead phase can contribute appreciably to overall carbon flux from marshes to the atmosphere, even in cool temperate climates, where most wetlands occur.

AB  - Concentrations of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) were measured in water and sediment columns of ditches in a minerotrophic peatland in The Netherlands. VOSC, with methanethiol (4 to 40 nM) as the major compound, appeared td be mainly of sediment origin. Both VOSC and hydrogen sulfide concentrations decreased dramatically towards the water surface. High methanethiol and high dimethyl sulfide concentrations in the sediment and just above the sediment surface coincided with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (correlation factors, r = 0.91 and r = 0.81, respectively). Production and degradation of VOSC were studied in 32 sediment slurries collected from various freshwater systems in The Netherlands. Maximal endogenous methanethiol production rates of the sediments tested (up to 1.44 mu mol per liter of sediment slurry.day(-1)) were determined after inhibition of methanogenic and sulfate-reducing populations in order to stop VOSC degradation. These experiments showed that the production and degradation of VOSC in sediments are well balanced. Statistical analysis revealed multiple relationships of methanethiol production rates with the combination of methane production rates (indicative of total anaerobic mineralization) and hydrogen sulfide concentrations (r = 0.90) or with the combination of methane production rates and the sulfate/iron ratios in the sediment (r = 0.82). These findings and the observed stimulation of methanethiol formation in sediment slurry incubations in which the hydrogen sulfide concentrations were artificially increased provided strong evidence that the anaerobic methylation of hydrogen sulfide is the main mechanism for VOSC formation in most freshwater systems. Methoxylated aromatic compounds are likely a major source of methyl groups for this methylation of hydrogen sulfide, since they are important degradation products of the abundant biopolymer lignin. Increased sulfate concentrations in several fresh,vater ecosystems caused by the inflow of water from the river Rhine into these systems result in higher hydrogen sulfide concentrations. As a consequence, higher flues of VOSC towards the atmosphere are conceivable.

AB  - Mangrove forests are highly-productive intertidal wetlands that support many ecosystem goods and services. In addition to providing fish and wildlife habitat, mangrove forests improve water quality, provide seafood, reduce coastal erosion, supply forest products, support coastal food webs, minimize flooding impacts, and support high rates of carbon sequestration. Despite their tremendous societal value, mangrove forests are threatened by many aspects of global change. Here, we examine the effects of global change on mangrove forests along the Gulf of Mexico coast, which is a valuable region for advancing understanding of global change impacts because the region spans multiple ecologically-relevant abiotic gradients that are representative of other mangrove transition zones across the world. We consider the historical and anticipated future responses of mangrove forests to the following aspects of global change: temperature change, precipitation change, accelerated sea-level rise, tropical cyclone intensification, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, eutrophication, invasive non-native species, and land use change. For each global change factor, we provide an initial global perspective but focus primarily on the three countries that border the Gulf of Mexico: United States, Mexico, and Cuba. The interactive effects of global change can have large ecological consequences, and we provide examples that highlight their importance. While some interactions between global change drivers can lead to mangrove mortality and loss, others can lead to mangrove expansion at the expense of other ecosystems. Finally, we discuss strategies for using restoration and conservation to maximize the adaptive capacity of mangrove forests to global change. To ensure that the ecosystem goods and services provided by mangrove forests continue to be available for future generations, there is a pressing need to better protect, manage, and restore mangrove forests as well as the adjacent ecosystems that provide opportunities for adaptation in response to global change.

AB  - Concentrations of dissolved and solid-phase inorganic sulfur compounds and sulfate reduction (SR) rates were measured in sediments along a lateral transect in the mesohaline region of the Chesapeake Bay estuary (USA). Areal SR rates varied seasonally from 2 to 10, 5 to 60, and 10 to 90 mmol m-2 d-1 in deep channel, channel slope and western flank sediments respectively, and with temperature according to an apparent activation energy of ca 83 kJ mol-1. March through November integrated SR rates were 1.3, 5.3 and 7.3 mol m-2 yr-1 at the 3 locations respectively. Summer SR rates in other mid-bay central channel and lower bay sediments were comparable to the highest rates found along the mid-bay transect. Sulfate reduction was maximal in the top 2 to 4 cm (0.2 to 2 mmol l-1 d-1) of sediment and decreased several-fold with depth to 12 cm in both mid- and lower bay sediments. Mid-bay central channel sediments underlying anoxic bottom water during the summer exhibited high concentrations (1 to 5 mM) of dissolved sulfide (DS), whereas bioturbated flank sediments had 5- to 10-fold lower DS concentrations (0.1 to 1 mM). In lower bay sediments, DS concentrations were < 0.1 mM in the upper 12 cm despite intense SR (25 to 100 mmol m-2 d-1). Solid phase reduced sulfur concentrations in mid- and lower bay sediments were not correlated with SR rates. Comparison of annual SR with reduced sulf ur burial indicated that < 30 % of total sulfide production is permanently retained in mid-bay sediments. A similar fraction of sulfide retention is expected to occur in lower bay sediments. Our results indicate that sulfur cycling accounts for a substantial portion of carbon mineralization and oxygen consumption over a large area of the mid- and lower Chesapeake Bay benthos.

AB  - The determination of total reduced sulfur, elemental sulfur, sulfide, thiosulfate and sulfite in porewaters - which were previously extracted from surface sediments collected in three bays, i.e. Seine, Fresnaye and Authie located in northern France - has been undertaken using different electroanalytical techniques: (linear sweep cathodic stripping voltammetry (LSCSV), square wave cathodic stripping voltammetry (SWCSV) and differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry (DPCSV)) at a static mercury drop electrode. Furthermore, the analyses of sulfur solids present in these sediments have been performed by sequential extraction procedures. Overall, the description of speciation of dissolved sulfur compounds and reduced sulfur solids has shown that the availability of sulfate and reactive iron, the sedimentation rate and probably even the nature and content of organic matter are important factors fur controlling the sulfidisation and pyritisation processes involved in the different sedimentary systems studied. Thus, in the Seine-bay sediments, it has been found that reactive iron scavenges the most part of the generated sulfide as a result of a particularly activated sulfate reduction by bacterial activities; as a consequence, this precipitation limits the accumulation in the porewaters of reduced sulfur compounds such as elemental sulfur and polysulfides which ought to be generated in the redox boundary (where the oxydants, viz. oxygen, nitrate and metal oxides exist abundantly) through a partial oxidation of the H2S and HS- species. This process is further accentuated by a sedimentation rate measured in the Seine estuary. Conversely, in the Authie bay and, to a lesser extent, in the Fresnaye bay the contribution of the sedimentation rate and/or reactive iron scavenging to the sedimentary sulfur processes is weaker. This explains the increase of the built-up of dissolved reduced sulfur in the interstitial waters as well as the existence of elemental sulfur and polysulfides that permit the conversion of FeS into FeS2.

AB  - Sprays of commercial preparations of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis are widely used for the control of mosquito larvae. Despite an abundant literature on B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis field efficiency on mosquito control, few studies have evaluated the fate of spores in the environment after treatments. In the present article, two complementary experiments were conducted to study the effect of different parameters on B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis persistence and recycling, in field conditions and in the laboratory. First, we monitored B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis persistence in the field in two contrasting regions in France: the Rhne-Alpes region, where mosquito breeding sites are temporary ponds under forest cover with large amounts of decaying leaf matter on the ground and the Mediterranean region characterized by open breeding sites such as brackish marshes. Viable B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis spores can persist for months after a treatment, and their quantity is explained both by the vegetation type and by the number of local treatments. We found no evidence of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis recycling in the field. Then, we tested the effect of water level, substrate type, salinity and presence of mosquito larvae on the persistence/recycling of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis spores in controlled laboratory conditions (microcosms). We found no effect of change in water level or salinity on B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis persistence over time (75 days). B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis spores tended to persist longer in substrates containing organic matter compared to sand-only substrates. B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis recycling only occurred in presence of mosquito larvae but was unrelated to the presence of organic matter.

AB  - Mudflats are highly productive coastal ecosystems that are dominated by halophytic vegetation. In this study, the mudflat sediment microbiome was investigated from Nalabana Island, located in a brackish water coastal wetland of India; Chilika, based on the MinION shotgun metagenomic analysis. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities were mostly composed of Proteobacteria (38.3%), Actinobacteria (20.7%), Euryarchaeota (76.1%), Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (6.8%), Ascomycota (47.2%), and Basidiomycota (22.0%). Bacterial and archaeal community composition differed significantly between vegetated mudflat and un-vegetated bulk sediments. Carbon, nitrogen, sulfur metabolisms, oxidative phosphorylation, and xenobiotic biodegradation were the most common microbial functionalities in the mudflat metagenomes. Furthermore, genes involved in oxidative stresses, osmotolerance, secondary metabolite synthesis, and extracellular polymeric substance synthesis revealed adaptive mechanisms of the microbiome in mudflat habitat. Mudflat metagenome also revealed genes involved in the plant growth and development, suggesting that microbial communities could aid halophytic vegetation by providing tolerance to the abiotic stresses in a harsh mudflat environment. Canonical correspondence analysis and co-occurrence network revealed that both biotic (vegetation and microbial interactions) and abiotic factors played important role in shaping the mudflat microbiome composition. Among abiotic factors, pH accounted for the highest variance (20.10%) followed by available phosphorus (19.73%), total organic carbon (9.94%), salinity (8.28%), sediment texture (sand) (6.37%) and available nitrogen (5.53%) in the mudflat microbial communities. Overall, this first metagenomic study provided a comprehensive insight on the community structure, potential ecological interactions, and genetic potential of the mudflat microbiome in context to the cycling of organic matter, xenobiotic biodegradation, stress resistance, and in providing the ecological fitness to halophytes. These ecosystem services of the mudflat microbiome must be considered in the conservation and management plan of coastal wetlands. This study also advanced our understanding of fungal diversity which is understudied from the coastal lagoon ecosystems.

AB  - Adsorptive cathodic stripping square wave voltammetry was used to determine dissolved Ti at nanomolar to sub-nanomolar levels in estuarine samples over a range of salinities and dissolved organic matter concentrations.  Dissolved Ti concentrations range from 0.2 to 13.7 nM and from 0.2 to 67 nM in the Delaware Bay and Winyah Bay (USA) estuarine systems, respectively.
   Early and late spring surveys in Delaware Bay show that dissolved Ti is largely removed during estuarine mixing.  Dissolved Ti concentrations decrease with decreasing filter size fraction, suggesting that Ti is associated with particles or colloids.  Mechanisms of Ti removal in estuaries may be similar to those of other particle-reactive elements, such as Fe.  Some coherence between the dissolved Si and Ti distributions during a spring diatom bloom suggests that biological scavenging may also be important.
   In the organic-rich Winyah Bay system, Ti concentrations are patchy, indicating that both addition and removal occur during the mixing of multiple source waters.  As biological productivity is low, a variety of physical and chemical processes probably control Ti behavior.  Such processes include interactions between particles, dissolved organic matter, and fluxes from adjacent reservoirs.

AB  - Climate change adaptation options for natural systems are particularly challenging in high density urban settings. We model the vulnerability of estuarine vegetation (mangroves, saltmarshes and Casuarina forest) to sea level rise in Australia's most populous city, Sydney, and conduct a detailed assessment of impacts and adaptation options for a densely urbanised estuary, the Cooks River. Our modelling demonstrates a range of opportunities for the preservation and, in some cases, expansion of estuarine vegetation area under sea-level rise, though this is largely dependent on the degree of flexibility applied in the management of existing open space. Mangrove area increases under a high sea-level rise scenario, more so than under a low sea-level rise scenario, due to opportunities for landward colonisation. However, this would require estuarine vegetation expansion and land-use conversion of recreational, industrial or private land. Sediment nourishment emerges as a potentially cost-efficient means of preserving wetlands. The mix of wetland types is likely to change without active management, with higher proportion of mangrove and substantially less saltmarsh under all scenarios. Implementation of living shorelines, as opposed to hard defensive structures, could be incentivised. This could be achieved by planning concessions, 'payment for ecosystem services' such as managing 'blue carbon' values, and zoning controls that promote visual amenity and ecological adaptation.

AB  - The oxidation of dimethylsulfide and methanethiol by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was investigated in Tanzanian mangrove sediments. The rate of dimethylsulfide and methanethiol accumulation in nonamended sediment slurry (control) incubations was very low while in the presence of the inhibitors tungstate and bromoethanesulfonic acid (BES), the accumulation rates ranged from 0.02-0.34 to 0.2-0.4 nmol g FW sediment(-1)h(-1), respectively. Degradation rates of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide added were 2-10-fold higher. These results point to a balance of production and degradation. Degradation was inhibited much stronger by tungstate than by BES, which implied that SRB were more important. In addition, a new species of SRB, designated strain SDI, was isolated. The isolate was a short rod able to utilize a narrow range of substrates including dimethylsulfide, methanethiol, pyruvate and butyrate. Strain SDI oxidized dimethylsulfide and methanethiol to carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide with sulfate as the electron acceptor and exhibited a low specific growth rate of 0.010 +/- 0.002 h(-1), but a high affinity for its substrates. The isolated microorganism could be placed in the genus Desulfosarcina (the most closely related cultured species was Desulfosarcina variabilis, 97% identity). Strain SDI represents a member of the dimethylsulfide/methanethiol-consuming SRB population in mangrove sediments.

AB  - Suspended particle dynamics were investigated in the Ogeechee River Estuary during neap tide in July 1996. Samples were operationally separated into ' truly suspended ' (settling velocity <0.006 cm s(-1)) and ' settleable ' (settling velocity >0.006 cm s(-1)) fractions over the course of a tidal cycle to determine whether these two fractions were comprised of particles with differing biological and chemical characteristics. Total suspended sediment, organic carbon and nitrogen, chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations were measured in each fraction, as well as rates of bacterial hydrolytic enzyme activity [beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta Gase) and beta-xylosidase (beta Xase)]. The majority of the suspended sediment (by weight) was in the truly suspended fraction; all measured parameters were largely associated with this fraction as well. When compared to the settleable material, the truly suspended material was significantly higher in % POC (57 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.9 +/- 1.8), % chlorophyll (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.01), % phaeopigment (0.030 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.018 +/- 0.012), and weight-specific maximal uptake rates (V-max per mg suspended sediment) of both enzymes (1.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.2 nmol mg(-1) h(-1) beta Gase and 1.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.3 +/- 0.2 nmol mg(-1) h(-1) beta Xase), providing clear evidence for a qualitative distinction between the two fractions. These results are interpreted to mean that the more organic-rich, biologically active material associated with the suspended fraction is likely to have a different fate in this Estuary, as ' truly suspended ' sediments will be readily transported whereas ' settleable ' sediments will settle and be resuspended with each tide. These types of qualitative differences should be incorporated into models of particle dynamics in estuaries. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - The concentration of lignin in plant tissue is a major factor controlling organic matter degradation rates in forest ecosystems. Microbial biomass and lignin and cellulose decomposition were measured for six weeks in forest soil microcosms in order to determine the influence of pH, moisture, and temperature on organic matter decomposition. Microbial biomass was determined by chloroform fumigation; lignin and cellulose decomposition were measured radiometrically. The experiment was designed as a Latin square with soils of pH of 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 adjusted to 20, 40, or 60% moisture content, and incubated at temperatures of 4, 12, or 24-degrees-C. Microbial biomass and lignin and cellulose decomposition were not significantly affected by soil acidity. Microbial biomass was greater at higher soil moisture contents. Lignin and cellulose decomposition significantly increased at higher soil temperatures and moisture contents. Soil moisture was more important in affecting microbial biomass then either soil temperature or soil pH.

AB  - Steep biogeochemical gradients were measured at mixing interfaces in a wetland-aquifer system impacted by landfill leachate in Norman, Oklahoma. The system lies within a reworked alluvial plain and is characterized by layered low hydraulic conductivity wetland sediments interbedded with sandy aquifer material. Using cm-scale passive diffusion samplers, "peepers", water samples were collected in a depth profile to span interfaces between surface water and a sequence of deeper sedimentary layers. Geochemical indicators including electron acceptors, low-molecular-weight organic acids, base cations, and NH4+ were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and field techniques to maximize the small sample volumes available from the centimeter-scale peepers. Steep concentration gradients of biogeochemical indicators were observed at various interfaces including those created at sedimentary boundaries and boundaries created by heterogeneities in organic C and available electron acceptors. At the sediment-water interface, chemical profiles with depth suggest that SO42- and Fe reduction dominate driven by inputs of organic C from the wetland and availability of electron acceptors. Deeper in the sediments (not associated with a lithologic boundary), a steep gradient of organic acids (acetate maximum 8.8 mM) and NH4+ (maximum 36 mM) is observed due to a localized source of organic matter coupled with the lack of electron acceptor inputs. These findings highlight the importance of quantifying the redox reactions occurring in small interface zones and assessing their role on biogeochemical cycling at the system scale.

AB  - Community metabolism and nutrient, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) cycling were examined in two intertidal, marine, microbial mat communities during short (4-5 days) incubations in closed, flow-through microcosms. Sediment microcosms were incubated under either light (light-dark cycles) or dark (continuous darkness) conditions to assess the effect(s) of photosynthetic oxygen production and microalgal activity on nutrient, Fe and Mn cycling. The effects of chemical redox reactions between reduced sulphur (S), Fe and Mn cycling were examined by blocking sulphate reduction, and reduced S production, with 25 mM molybdate while incubating under dark conditions.
   In light-incubated microcosms, negligible fluxes of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and trace metals were observed. A substantial sediment-water flux of reduced Fe (Fe2+) and Mn (Mn2+) was observed in microcosms incubated under continuous darkness; highest fluxes were observed in molybdate-amended microcosms. At both sites, biologically-mediated redox reactions accounted for a substantial (>50%) portion of the Fe2+ and Mn2+ flux. Both microbial mat communities exhibited similar rates of gross photosynthetic oxygen (O-2) production, but dramatically different rates of net benthic O-2 flux. Distinct patterns of net O-2 production and trace metal cycling arose from differences in either trace metal oxide availability or reactivity (mineralogy), organic carbon mineralization rates, or sediment characteristics (porosity). Variations in the microbial community responsible for trace metal cycling could have also contributed to the pattern. The present data illustrate that chemically-mediated redox reactions between metal oxides and reduced S complicate interpretation of Fe and Mn fluxes, underscoring the need to separate chemical and biological reactions when attempting to determine the role of biological trace metal reduction in organic carbon oxidation.

AB  - Rangeland degradation poses a serious environmental and economic problem in northern China. This study investigated soil conditions and plant community patches prior to and after grazing exclusion in Youyu County, Shanxi Province. The soil at this site has a pH of 8.2 to 10.1 and electrical conductivity of 0.4 to 5.9 dS m(-1). With the exception of bare patches, the patches were named after the dominant species, that is, Artemisia anethifolia Weber ex Stechm. (AA), Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (PA), Puccinellia distans (Jacq.) Parl. (PD), Chloria virgate Sw. (CV), and Leymus secalinus (Georgi) Tzvel. (LS) with increasing biomass production, Shannon-Wiener index (H'), evenness index (V'), degree of succession (Ds), and patch shape parameters. Canonical correlation analysis was used to explain the relationships between soil variables and biological, and between soil variables and shape variables of the community patches. The soil canonical variable was represented by soil moisture, organic matter, and bulk density with a standardized canonical coefficient of 1.09, 0.79, and -0.69, respectively. The plant canonical variable was represented by biomass production with correlation coefficient of 0.96 (P = 0.0021). A total of 73.0% of the variance standardizing the measuring units of the plant variables were explained by the soil canonical variable, indicating that the first latent soil variable could be used to predict the latent plant variable. Open grazing (90% biomass removal) contributed to the deterioration of the grassland. Over a 2-yr period, grazing exclusion did not increase the H' but it did increase biomass production. Therefore, correcting soil problems is needed in addition to reducing the grazing stock.

AB  - Past coastal reconstruction is useful for understanding archaeological coastal settlements and predicting how coastal change might affect modern populations. The ancient Maritime Maya inhabitants of Vista Alegre in the northeastern Yucatan were active seafaring peoples. However, the past coastal landscape environmental history is unknown. Previous research concentrated on the fully terrestrial component of the site, and did not approach the issue from an earth sciences, sedimentological perspective. In this study, a sediment core campaign in the shallow offshore of Vista Alegre aimed to reconstruct the coastal and environmental changes that occurred over the past 3000 years, and specifically identify the changes in sea-level. Nine cores were analyzed using a multi-proxy approach including a range of sedimentological parameters such as granulometry, micropaleontology (foraminifera), radiocarbon dating, and loss on ignition. The sediment cores provided an archive of environmental changes related to sea-level change, anthropogenic influence, and shifting microenvironments which can be associated with cultural time periods. The environmental phases and shifts show some linkage to the archaeological chronology, suggesting an association between the environmental conditions and human activities. Sea-level changes and shifting shorelines have always been, and still are, a challenge for coastal settlements, and ancient sites can be a harbinger of what to anticipate in the future. In addition to this, current natural and anthropogenic pressures on coastlines are placing archaeological sites at increasing risk and thereby threatening this important scientific and cultural archive. Therefore, efforts to identify, characterize, and record natural and anthropogenic pressures prior to destruction are increasingly important.

AB  - Four sediment cores representing adjacent mudflat and mangrove sub-environments of middle estuary (Shastri) were analyzed for sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon. Total metal concentration of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and lead (Pb) and chemical speciation of Fe, Mn, and Co on selected samples was also carried out on mudflat cores. The sediments in the upper middle estuary were found to be deposited under highly varying hydrodynamic energy conditions; whereas lower middle estuary experienced relatively stable hydrodynamic energy conditions with time. The tributary joining the river near the upper middle estuary is found to be responsible for the addition of enhanced organic carbon and metal concentrations. Speciation study indicated Fe and Co are from natural lithogenic origin while Mn is derived from anthropogenic sources. Higher Mn and Co than apparent effects threshold can pose a high risk of toxicity to organisms associated with these sediments.

AB  - We examined soil porewater concentrations of sulfate, alkalinity, phosphorus, nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon and solid phase concentrations of pyrite in relation to mangrove species distributions along a 3.1-km-long transect that traversed a 47.1-km(2) mangrove forest in the Dominican Republic. Iron, phosphorus, and sulfur dynamics are closely coupled to the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria, the primary decomposers in anoxic soils of mangrove ecosystems. Patterns in the chemistry data suggested that sulfate reduction rates and storage of reduced sulfur were greater in the inland basin forest dominated by Laguncularia racemosa than the Rhizophora mangle dominated forest of the lower tidal region. The distribution of Laguncularia was significantly correlated with concentrations of total phosphorus (r = 0.99) and dissolved organic carbon (r = 0.86), alkalinity (r = 0.60), and the extent of sulfate depletion (r = 0.77) in the soil porewater and soil pyrite concentrations (r = 0.72) across the tidal gradient. Leaf tissue chemistry of Laguncularia in was characterized by lower C:N and C:P ratios that could fuel the higher rates of decomposition in the Laguncularia-dominated forest. We suggest that a plant-soil-microbial feedback contributes to the spatial patterning of vegetation and soil variables across the intertidal zone of many mangrove forest communities.

AB  - A detailed study of sediment components and selected metals has been carried out in two mudflat cores collected from the creeks of Kalinadi Estuary, India, in order to assess the variations in distribution of sediment components, metals, and the controlling processes, including early diagenetic movements, if any. Grain size analyses reveal the possibilities of three episodes of deposition in a highly varying depositional environment with overall fining up of the cores. Organic carbon (OC) is comparatively high in muddy Core KM, which was collected from a more sheltered creek with a narrow mouth in the estuarine interior, than sandy Core KH, which was collected from a creek with a wide mouth nearer to the sea. Geochemical data show an upper zone of marked enrichment of all trace metals, including Fe and Mn, in both the cores. The variations in sediment components as well as associated metals between the two cores reveal variations in controlling factors including the morphology setup. The distribution of trace metals in Core KH are controlled by the proportions of finer fraction of sediments, degradation of organic carbon, and redox-sensitive Fe and Mn oxides, while the distribution of trace metals in Core KM are probably controlled by the finer sediments as well as by redox-sensitive Fe and Mn oxides.

AB  - Benthic bivalves are important links between primary production and consumers, and are essential intermediates in the flow of energy through estuarine systems. However, information on the diet of filter feeding bivalves in estuarine ecosystems is uncertain, as estuarine waters contain particulate matter from a range of sources and as bivalves are opportunistic feeders. We surveyed bivalves at different distances from the creek mouth at the Yangtze estuarine marsh in winter and summer, and analyzed trophic dynamics using stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) techniques. Different bivalve species had different spatial distributions in the estuary. Giauconome chinensis mainly occurred in marshes near the creek mouth, while Sinonovacula constricta preferred the creek. Differences were found in the diets of different species. S. constricta consumed more diatoms and bacteria than G. chinensis, while G. chinensis assimilated more macrophyte material. FA markers showed that plants contributed the most (38.86 +/- 4.25%) to particular organic matter (POM) in summer, while diatoms contributed the most (12.68 +/- 1.17%) during winter. Diatoms made the largest contribution to the diet of S. constricta in both summer (24.73 +/- 0.44%) and winter (25.51 +/- 0.59%), and plants contributed no more than 4%. This inconsistency indicates seasonal changes in food availability and the active feeding habits of the bivalve. Similar FA profiles for S. constricta indicated that the bivalve had a similar diet composition at different sites, while different delta C-13 results suggested the diet was derived from different carbon sources (C-4 plant Spartina alterniflora and C-3 plant Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) at different sites. Species-specific and temporal and/or spatial variability in bivalve feeding may affect their ecological functions in intertidal marshes, which should be considered in the study of food webs and material flows in estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - We review links between autotrophic production, crab herbivory and estuarine food chains in southeastern Australia, a region where mangrove and saltmarsh co-exist towards mangrove poleward limits. Studies in estuaries and embayments across the region have demonstrated a consistent and important role of crab larvae released in synchronised spawning during the spring tide in supplementing the diet of zooplanktivorous fishes. These numerically dominant fishes have been linked through isotopic studies to commercially important predator species. The role of macrophytic vegetation (mangrove and saltmarsh) in the diet of crabs remains controversial, though isotopic analysis has demonstrated the contribution of the C4 grass Sporobolus virginicus to crabs feeding in saltmarsh. Other dietary sources include microphytic algae, and potentially stranded zooplankton. The link between sediment organic matter, crab and zooplanktivore isotopic composition remained tightly coupled in spite of variation in anthropogenic N between estuaries and the isotopic signature of mangroves. Long-term threats to these trophic linkages include coastal squeeze associated with sea-level rise, and the fragmentation and disconnection of habitats.

AB  - Mussel aquaculture activities in coastal areas are growing rapidly throughout the world, inducing an increasing interest and concern for their potential impact on coastal marine environments. We have investigated the impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a mussel farm in a lagoonar ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea (Bizerta lagoon, northern Tunisia) on the benthic environment. The most evident changes in the benthic habitat under the farm were a strong reduction of oxygen penetration into the bottom sediments and a large accumulation of chlorophyll a (concentrations up to 16 mu g g(-1)), phaeopigments (concentrations up to 48 mu g g(-1)) and total organic matter (concentrations up to 12%). Results from univariate analysis of the nematofaunal data show that the nematode abundance increased in all the stations located inside the mussel farm (11, 12, 13) and the site 12, located in the centre of the mussel farm, was the most affected. At this site, Shannon-Wiener index H', species richness (d), evenness (J') and number of species (S) decreased significantly. Results from multivariate analyses of the species abundance data demonstrated that responses of nematode species to the organic matter enrichment were varied: Mesacanthion diplechma was eliminated at the most affected station (12), whereas the abundances of Paracomesoma dubium, Terschellingia longicaudata and T. communis were significantly enhanced. Responses of free-living nematodes to mussel farm biodeposition (elimination of some species and increase or decrease of some others) could lead to food limitation for their predators that, ultimately, could alter entire communities and ecosystems. Consequently, we suggest that site-specific hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions should be taken into account when planning new mussel farms, and meiobenthic communities should be monitored before and after farm development to prevent excessive modifications of benthic assemblage structure.

AB  - This study in French Guiana evaluates the changes of crab assemblages and their bioturbation activities between mangrove early stages (pioneer and young mangrove) and within stages by taking their spatial heterogeneity (tidal channels, flat areas, pools) into account. The results show differences in crab assemblage structure between and within the early stages of mangrove in relation to microhabitat and sediment characteristics. The sediment reworking rates are a function of the biomass or density of particular species (Ucides cordatus, Uca cumulanta) and burrower functional groups. Crab species or functional interactions mediate changes in sediment reworking rates suggesting the need to consider entire benthic communities rather than single species. This study suggests that the role of the micro habitat in determining the biologically -induced sediment reworking rates depends on the age of the mangrove. Feeding activity results in a sediment turnover of 11.7 +/- 9.7 g(dw) m(-2) day(-1) and 6.8 +/- 3.0 g(dw) m(-2) day(-1) in the pioneer and young mangroves, respectively. Burrow maintenance excavates 40.5 +/- 7.4 g(dw) m(-2) day(-1) and 251.3 +/- 419.7 g(dw) m(-2) day(-1) in the pioneer and young mangroves, respectively. Upscaling to the studied area (Sinnamary estuary: 6 km(2)), shows that 500 tons.day(-1) and 20 tons.day(-1) of sediments could be excavated and pelletized, respectively, during the spring tides of the dry season. Thus, biological sediment reworking would greatly contribute to the sedimentary dynamics of the Guianese mangroves under Amazonian influence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report results of transplant experiments that examined direct interactions between red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) roots and two common root-fouling sponges (Tedania ignis and Haliclona implexiformis) on carbonate-based, oligotrophic mangrove cays in Belize, Central America. On these cays, subtidal prop roots of mangroves at water's edge often extend 1-2 m below lowest low water before anchoring in the substrate and host a community of algal and invertebrate epibionts dominated by massive sponges. Live sponges transplanted onto otherwise bare roots increased root growth rate two- to fourfold relative to controls. Roots fouled naturally by these and other massive sponges produce adventitious fine rootlets that ramify throughout sponge tissue; these rootlets structurally resemble underground rootlets that function in nutrient uptake. Sponges transplanted onto bare mangrove roots induced rootlet proliferation within 4 wk. Only live sponges elicited this response, indicating that adventitious rootlet production is not simply a by-product of anoxia or darkness. Sponges transplanted onto bare roots grew 1.4-10 times faster than did sponges grown on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes at identical depths and locations. Relative abundances of N-15 (expressed as delta(15)N parts per thousand) and C-13 (delta(13)C parts per thousand) in Tedania, Haliclona, an additional sponge, Ulosa ruetzleri, and rootlets, roots, stems, twigs, and leaves of mangrove hosts suggest that mangrove roots obtain dissolved inorganic nitrogen from sponges, and that sponges obtain carbon from mangrove roots. No transfer of N or C was observed in similar analyses of roots fouled by the red alga Acanthophora spicifera. We conclude that where they co-occur, massive sponges and mangroves are facultative mutualists. In mangrove forests, as in other marginal habitats, facilitations may enable increased growth and production of component species.

AB  - Tidal freshwater marshes are diverse habitats that differ both within and between marshes in terms of plant community composition, sediment type, marsh elevation, and nutrient status. Because our knowledge of the nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry of tidal freshwater systems is limited, it is difficult to assess how these marshes will respond to long-term progressive nutrient loading due to watershed development and urbanization. We present a process-based mass balance model of N cycling in Sweet Hall marsh, a pristine (i.e., low nutrient) Peltandra virginica-Pontederia cordata dominated tidal freshwater marsh in the York River estuary, Virginia. The model, which was based on a combination of field and literature data, revealed that N cycling in the system was largely conservative. The mineralization of organic N to NH4+ provided almost twice as much inorganic N as was needed to support marsh macrophyte and benthic microalgal primary production. Efficient utilization of porewater NH4+ by nitrifiers and other microbes resulted in low rates of tidal NH4+ export from the marsh and little accumulation of NH4+ in marsh porewaters. Inputs of N from the estuary and atmosphere were not critical in supporting marsh primary production, and served to balance N losses due to denitrification and burial. A comparison of these results with the literature suggests that the relative importance of tidal freshwater marsh N cycling processes, including plant productivity, organic matter mineralization, microbial immobilization, and coupled nitrification-denitrification, are largely independent of small changes in water column N loading. Although very high (millimolar) concentrations of dissolved inorganic N can affect processes including denitrification and plant productivity, the factors that cause the switch from efficient N recycling to a more open N cycle have not yet been identified.

AB  - Sea-level rise is expected to cause saltwater intrusion into tidal freshwater wetlands. The resulting changes in the soil environment would likely cause shifts in plant and microbial communities and alter ecosystem functions. To simulate saltwater intrusion, we constructed a solar-powered automated irrigation system. The system consisted of holding tanks that were filled with freshwater or artificial brackish water during high tide. During low tide, the water was gravity-fed through solenoid valves and metered out to each plot. This system was controlled by an open-source microcontroller platform and built from off-the-shelf electronics at a cost of $1800. Porewater salinity in near-surface soils of the plots receiving brackish water was increased from freshwater to oligohaline levels within one month of operation and was maintained throughout the first summer of operation. This porewater manipulation led to changes in the plant community and in exchanges of carbon dioxide and methane between the marsh and atmosphere. The system has proven to be a reliable way of manipulating wetland salinity for studying changes in the physicochemical environment. With modifications, it could be used to manipulate nutrient loads, hydrology, and sediment supply in other wetland systems.

AB  - The burrowing crab Chasmagnathus granulatus is the most abundant bioturbator in estuarine intertidal sediments from southern Brazil to central Argentina. This crab is a deposit feeder that excavates and maintains large semi-permanent open burrows with funnel shaped entrances. In this study we showed that the funnel shaped burrows with low aspect ratio are the most common and, with field experiments, we demonstrated that these burrows are also the most efficient in the capture of organic matter. As shown by C isotopic signatures, the origin of trapped detrital material is Spartina densiflora. Burrows are distributed in the upper part of estuaries and saltmarshes, mostly in areas of low energy, and cover extensive areas between the marsh vegetation and the open estuary. Through sampling of crab densities and use of satellite images, we estimated the number of burrows of different shapes in the Bahia Blanca estuary (38 degrees 50'S), one of the largest estuarine intertidals in the SW Atlantic. After combining this information with the trapping efficiency of burrows of different shapes, we estimated that within 100 d, a crab bed could capture the entire annual production from a marsh area of similar size. Therefore, we suggest that these extensive burrow beds may be considered large macrodetritus retention areas, reducing the amount of organic matter exported from marshes but locally increasing the sediment organic matter content.

AB  - To reveal the feeding habits of 3 bivalve species and the effects on the sediment and benthic diatoms, a field experiment was conducted in the estuarine Gamo lagoon, Japan, using enclosures stocked with bivalves. The surface-deposit feeder Macoma contabulata reduced silt-clay, total nitrogen, and total organic carbon content and the delta C-13 value of the sediment, while the surface-deposit feeder Nuttallia olivacea and the suspension feeder Ruditapes philippinarum did not. The surface-deposit feeders reduced phytobenthic biomass (chlorophyll a, ch1 a) and diatom density at the sediment surface and increased the C/N ratios of the sediment. In contrast, R. philippinarum increased ch1 a although it decreased benthic diatoms, suggesting the promotion of microalgal growth other than diatoms. All the bivalve species reduced the densities of the dominant diatom species differently, and M. contabulata decreased the species richness. Multidimensional scaling and 1-way analysis of similarity revealed that the bivalves specifically modified the abundances and composition of the diatoms in relation to their feeding habits, while the relative diatom species abundances hardly changed. These data suggest that the bivalves show little selectivity when they ingest benthic diatoms. A 2-source mixing model using delta C-13 values revealed that benthic diatoms were the more important carbon source (> 69%) for the deposit-feeding bivalves, both in natural habitats and in enclosures. In contrast, R. philippinarum obtained 61% carbon from suspended solids (SS) in the natural habitat, whereas in the enclosures it obtained 62% carbon from benthic diatoms. The dietary change of this species might be related to the supply of SS and resuspended sediment.

AB  - Microphytobenthos (MPB) at higher latitudes has been poorly studied. This study used pulse-chase C-13-labeling to investigate the production, processing, and fate of MPB-derived carbon (MPB-C) in sub-Arctic intertidal sediments over 31 d. Gross primary production (2.1 mmolCm(-2)h(-1)+/- 0.4 mmolCm(-2)h(-1)) was comparable to that reported for temperate regions. Some of the C-13 fixed by sub-Arctic MPB was rapidly (within 0.5 d) transferred to deeper sediments (below 2 cm), but most was retained within surface sediments (>70.2% of the C-13 present at any time during the study). At any time, MPB accounted for49.8% of this C-13. The C-13 content of sediment organic carbon declined over time, but>31% of the C-13 fixed within the first tidal cycle remained after 31 d, suggesting that sub-Arctic MPB may contribute to coastal carbon retention during the productive season. Over 21 d, 10.6% of the fixed C-13 was removed via DIC fluxes and 0.3% via DOC fluxes from inundated sediment, and 0.6% as CO2 from exposed sediment. The greatest loss of C-13 (38.2%) was via unmeasured pathways, including resuspension and/or removal by mobile consumers. The rates of MPB-C production and the relative importance of the pathways for MPB-C loss were similar to that observed for comparable lower latitude sediments, demonstrating that MPB at higher latitudes are not necessarily distinct from MPB at lower latitudes and probably play a similarly important role in ecosystem functioning. Apparently, local environmental conditions are more important than climate differences for determining the processing and fate of MPB-C.

AB  - Holocene deposits of the NW German coastal plain consist of many different lithological facies, for example tidal flats, brackish water sediments and pear beds. The effects of the Holocene sea-level rise on palaeoenvironmental conditions of this coastal sequence were studied by inorganic geochemical methods in conjunction with diatom analyses. Three hundred samples from two parallel sediment cores which cover the entire NW German Holocene were taken at high resolution and were examined for major and minor elements and bulk parameters. Selected samples were analysed for redox-sensitive trace elements and REE distribution, reactive iron and bulk sediment (SiS)-Si-34-S-32-ratios. Chemical parameters, for example Si/Al and Ca/Sr-ratios and total organic carbon (TOC) contents correlate with depositional factors such as wave-energy and lithofacies changes, which allow a detailed reconstruction of the palaeoenvironment. Diatom analyses reveal information about changes between marine, brackish and limnic conditions and serve to reconstruct palaeosalinity. Early diagenetic effects are evident in the TOC-rich intervals. Most peat layers are affected by sulphate reduction and resulting pyrite formation as well as by enrichments in redox-sensitive trace elements. The highest enrichments are seen for As, Mo, Re and U, indicating a distinct seawater influence. S-isotope ratios of peat samples are compatible with pyrite formation under both open- and closed-system conditions, depending on exposition to Seawater. The inorganic geochemical and diatom data suggest limnic conditions at the base of the sequence and repeated changes towards marine conditions within the overlying elastic units. On the other hand, data obtained from the elastic units yield evidence of a recurrent succession from open to restricted marine, brackish-lagoonal, and finally fen environments. Clastic sediments overlying peat layers, correlate with the increase of marine-derived geochemical signatures and pelagic diatoms attest transgressive overlaps. The analyses suggest that major controls on the palaeoenvironments were (i) climate-related oscillations of the coast line and (ii) the morphology of the coastal region allowing marine incursions even into distal semi-terrestrial lowlands.

AB  - The potential trophic importance of the sesarmine crab Sesarma messa Campbell in a northeastern Australian mangrove dominated by Rhizophora stylosa Griff. was evaluated by quantifying the rates of mangrove leaf Litter consumption, the corresponding faecal production and assimilation efficiency of mangrove organic matter by the crab. S. messa seems to remove primarily carbon rather than nitrogen from the mangrove litter, as is reflected by the decrease in C but slight increase in N content of the faeces over mangrove litter. Assimilation efficiency for mangrove organic matter was only at about 50%. The potential significance of the crab faecal material in initiating a coprophagous food chain involving mangrove invertebrates was assessed by a series of growth experiments using the hyalid amphipod Parhyalella sp., which is commonly (mean density of 204 ind. l(-1) of detritus) found amongst accumulated detritus near the mangrove forest. Parhyalella sp. individuals fed with crab faecal material or a mixture of faecal material and mangrove detritus attained significantly higher moulting frequency but lower mortality rates than their counterparts in the mangrove detritus only treatment and the control (no food) over a period of 26 d, although % gut fullness was not significantly different amongst the 3 diet treatments. Assimilation of crab faecal material by Parhyalella sp. was almost complete, while individuals fed with R. stylosa litter could assimilate only about 51% of the organic matter in their diet. Decomposition of crab faecal material resulted in a significant increase in N but decrease in C content over 24 d. The C/N ratio of the faecal material was significantly lower than that of the mangrove Litter from which it was generated and decreased linearly with time of decomposition. S. messa therefore are not only important as a significant agent effecting fast recycling of mangrove leaf litter, but their faeces, from leaf litter consumption, may also form the basis of a coprophagous food chain contributing to mangrove secondary production by small invertebrates such as Parhyalella sp.

AB  - This is the first detailed investigation of the distribution and ecology of living (stained) shallow water (0-6 m) foraminifera along the Skagerrak-Kattegat coast, eastern North Sea. A total of 25 species (13 agglutinated; 12 calcareous) are common in the 169 sediment surface samples which were collected from 27 geographic areas. The sediment grain size and total organic carbon (TOC) content are strongly variable and the salinity and temperature ranges were 10-31 parts per thousand and 9-30 degrees C, respectively, at the time of sampling (July to October) but temperatures down to freezing occur during the winter. The species are divided into six environmental categories of which the first five comprise euryhaline and the sixth essentially stenohaline taxa: (I) species associated only with marsh plants, (2) species basically, but not entirely, associated with marsh plants, (3) species basically, but not entirely, restricted to non-marsh areas, (4) species solely recorded in non-marsh intertidal to subtidal environments, (5) species restricted to subtidal areas, (6) species basically living in the most open marine areas. in this region, marshes have a patchy distribution and they are small and compressed due to low tidal ranges (<40 cm). Balticammina pseudomacrescens (not reported here before) lives in the most elevated, landward, terrestrial parts of marshes and thus defines the uppermost limit of the influence of marine water. However, the marshes are generally dominated by Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca at the landward and seaward sides, respectively. Judammina macrescens is observed living epiphytically on decaying Carex leaf debris. The most widely distributed euryhaline species are Elphidium williamsoni, Miliammina fusca, Ammonia beccarii, and Haynesina germanica. The former two are common only in sediments with a mud content less than about 60%, whereas the latter two are common even in sediments with >80% mud. Ammoscalaria runiana is common only in coarse-grained sediments (<20% mud) with low TOC (less than or equal to 0.7%). There are no marked biogeographic boundaries within the Skagerrak-Kattegat area but 10 of the 25 commonly occurring species have not been reported from the adjacent Baltic Sea, probably partly due to the brackish character of the water there. The southern limits of distribution of the northern species, Elphidium albiumbilicatum, Ammotium cassis, and Ophthalmina kilianensis, an in the Kattegat-Baltic Sea. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Fluxes of the biogenic sulfur gases carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methyl mercaptan (MeSH), and carbon disulfide (CS2) were determined for several freshwater and coastal marine tundra habitats using a dynamic enclosure method and gas chromatography. In the freshwater tundra sites, highest emissions, with a mean of 6.0 nmol m-2 h-1 (1.5-10) occurred in the water-saturated wet meadow areas inhabited by grasses, sedges and Sphagnum mosses. In the drier upland tundra sites, highest fluxes occurred in areas inhabited by mixed vegetation and labrador tea at 3.0 nmol m-2 h-1 (0-8.3) and lowest fluxes were from lichen-dominated areas at 0.9 nmol m-2 h-1. Sulfur emissions from a lake surface were also low at 0.8 nmol m-2 h-1. Of the compounds measured, DMS was the dominant gas emitted from all of these sites. Sulfur emissions from the marine sites were up to 20-fold greater than fluxes in the freshwater habitats and were also dominated by DMS. Emissions of DMS were highest from intertidal soils inhabited by Carex subspathacea (150-250 nmol m-2 h-1). This Carex sp. was grazed thoroughly by geese and DMS fluxes doubled when goose feces were left within the flux chamber. Emissions were much lower from other types of vegetation which were more spatially dominant. Sulfur emissions from tundra were among the lowest reported in the literature. When emission data were extrapolated to include all tundra globally, the global flux of biogenic sulfur from this biome is 2-3 x 10(8) g yr-1. This represents less than 0.001% of the estimated annual global flux (approximately 50 Tg) of biogenic sulfur and <0.01% of the estimated terrestrial flux. The low emissions are attributed to the low availability of sulfate, certain hydrological characteristics of tundra, and the tendency for tundra to accumulate organic matter.

AB  - The supply of nutrients from surface and subsurface water flow into the root zone was measured in a developing barrier island marsh in Virginia. We hypothesize that high production of tall-form Spartina alterniflora in the lower intertidal zone is due to a greater nitrogen input supplied by a larger subsurface flux. Individual nitrogen inputs to the tall-form and short-form S. alterniflora root zones were calculated from water flow rates into the root zone and the nutrient concentration corresponding to the source of the flow. Total dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input las ammonium and nitrate) was then calculated using a summation of the hourly nutrient inputs to the root zone over the entire tidal cycle based on hydrologic and nutrient data collected throughout the growing season (April-August) of 1993 and 1994. Additionally, horizontal water flow into the lower intertidal marsh was reduced experimentally to determine its effects on nutrient input and plant growth. Total ammonium (NTH,I) input to the tall-form S. alterniflora root zone (168 mu moles 6 h(-1)) was significantly greater relative to the short-form (45 mu moles 6 h(-1)) during flood tide. Total NH4+ input was not significantly different between growth forms during ebb tide, and total nitrate (NO3-) and total DIN input were not significantly different between growth forms during either tidal stage. During tidal flooding, vertical flow from below the root zone accounted for 71% and horizontal flow from the adjacent mudflat accounted for 19% of the total NH4+ input to the tall-form S. alterniflora root zone. Infiltration of flooding water accounted for 15% more of the total NO3- input relative to the total NH4+ input at both zones on flood tide. During ebb tide, vertical flow from below the root zone still accounted for the majority of NH4+ and NO3- input to both growth forms. After vertical flow, horizontal subsurface flow from upgradient accounted for the next largest percentages of NH4+ and NO3- input to both growth forms during ebb tide. After 2 yr of interrupted subsurface horizontal flow to the tall-form S. alterniflora root zone, height and nitrogen content of leaf tissue of treatment plants were only slightly, but significantly, lower than control plants. The results suggest that a dynamic supply of DIN las influenced by subsurface water flows) is a more accurate depiction of nutrient supply to macrophytes in this developing marsh, relative to standing stock nutrient concentrations. The dynamic subsurface supply of DIN may play a role in spatial patterns of aboveground S. alterniflora production, but determination of additional nitrogen inputs and the role of belowground production on nitrogen demand need to also be considered.

AB  - The influence of sediment organic matter content on biomass production of Potamogeton pectinatus L. was investigated using nine Camargue sediments ranging from 8 to 66 mg C g-1. The biomass production of P. pectinatus was found to increase with increasing sediment organic matter content up to 26 mg C g-1. Biomass production was low on some sediments with a high organic matter content. Further experiments showed that the increase in biomass production was probably owing to increased availability of nitrogen which is released during the mineralization of organic matter. Modification of the water content and/or structure of the sediments by the addition of sand had no influence on biomass production. The relatively low biomass production observed on some sediments rich in organic matter could not be explained by a lack of available nitrogen, but presumably by anoxic conditions caused by the high quantities of organic matter present. The addition of iron and sulphide had a negative effect on biomass production, presumably owing to the presence of Fe2+ and S2- in the interstitial water. Concentrations of Fe2+ and S2- in the interstitial water of the sediments of some marshes in the Camargue were found to be sufficiently high to be of ecological importance to submerged macrophytes.

AB  - Numerous karst dolines have been formed along the Croatian coast and many have been submerged during the Late Glacial and Holocene sea level rise. The coastal area of Cres Island in the Northern Adriatic is a typical example of this geomorphological setting, where transitional forms from subaerial to submerged dolines are present. Once dolines are formed they can accumulate soil, water and sediments due to their morphology. Sediments are an especially valuable source of environmental data. This paper presents the results of the study of foraminiferal assemblages and sediment geochemistry, supplemented with grain-size and mineralogical data, from the marine ponds developed in the karst dolines on Cres Island. Obtained data is correlated with the sediment core record from submerged dolines in the present-day embayments along the coastal zone of Cres Island. In total, 3 sediment cores were collected in the marine ponds Marinska, Arcij and Podbrajde, while 2 longer sediment cores have been extracted from the Jaz and Sonte embayments. The Marinska, Arcij and Podbrajde marine ponds have distinct geochemical and mineralogical sediment compositions, with monospecific foraminiferal assemblages and generally differ from each other. The common characteristics are their high N and P concentrations and the algal origin of organic matter. Agglutinated foraminiferal taxa (Haplophragmoides canariensis and Trochammina inflata), typical for intertidal environments, are abundant in the brackish-water Marinska pond, while stress-tolerant species Ammonia tepida has been identified in the Arcij marine pond. Environmental conditions in the Podbrajde marine pond did not facilitate the development of a rich foraminiferal fauna. Results from the present-day marine ponds enabled recognition of similar environments in the sediment cores collected in the Jaz and Sonte embayments that were progressively inundated during the Holocene sea level rise. A palaeo-marine pond existed in the Sonte embayment until 6610 cal BP, when the sea flooded the investigated area. A marine pond in the Jaz embayment was formed at 711 cal BP. Low-diversity foraminiferal assemblages in these palaeo-ponds are similar to those recognized in the present-day Arcij marine pond on Cres Island. However, differences in the geochemical composition of palaeo-marine ponds, in comparison to the present-day ponds, exist. They might be attributed to climate variability over time and variations in the geological setting of each environment. High Mo concentrations and abundant organic matter content are the main sediment characteristics of the recognized palaeo-marine ponds in the Jaz and Sonte embayments.

AB  - Purpose To understand the bioaccumulation of heavy metals by Cyperus malaccensis (CM) and Spartina alterniflora (SA) in a typical subtropical estuary (Min River) of Southeast China, the concentrations of five metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni) in plants and sediments of CM and SA marshes were determined.
   Materials and methods Two experimental plots (no flooding plot and flooding plot) were established in the intertidal zone of the Min River estuary in July 2015, and, in each plot, in situ sampling was conducted in CM and SA marshes, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis.
   Results and discussion Vertical variations of the five metals differed between marshes or plots, and, in most cases, there was no evidence of grain-size composition (particularly for clay) and sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amounts of metals in sediments of different marshes. Flooding regime was an important factor inducing the difference of metals in sediments of the two experimental plots. Heavy metal levels in different tissues of CM and SA differed within species or plots. For the five metals, the root was generally the main stock, and, as water condition changed from non-flooding to flooding, allocations of Pb, Cu, and Zn in CM and SA decreased while those of Cr increased. The accumulation factors [AF(s)] of heavy metals in different tissues of CM and SA also differed between species or plots. In most cases, the [AF](plant) of different metals were less than 1, implying that the metal accumulations in CM and SA of the two plots were uncommon.
   Conclusions This study found that Cu and Zn pollution in non-flooding conditions and Pb and Cu pollution in flooding conditions might be more serious, indicating that intertidal sediments might be severely contaminated by the three metals if effective measures are not taken to control the pollutant loadings of the Min River estuary in the future. Moreover, CM generally accumulated more Pb, Cu, and Zn while SA absorbed more Cr and Ni (particularly in flooding conditions), implying that, when determining environmental pressures, the two plants could be used as specified biological indicators.

AB  - Sediment samples were collected in 4 sites along a salinity gradient (between 0.2 and 27.3) of the Aussa River (Marano Lagoon, northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) and a decreasing gradient of industrial contamination downstream (from Stn A1 to Stn A4) to assess how a riverine-lagoonal system responds to chemical contamination by applying an integrative measure of its benthic ecological properties. Benthic biodiversity (primary producers, meiofauna, macrofauna) along with other structural and functional parameters were related to contamination. Meiofaunal abundance varied between 176 +/- 65 and similar to 4000 ind. 10 cm(-2) downstream. The macrofaunal composition shifted from one composed exclusively of chironomid larvae to a typically lagoonal one. At Stn A1, the benthic microalgal abundance exceeded 500 000 cells cm(-3) and seemed unaffected by contamination. In the freshwater-impacted site, primary production was one order of magnitude higher than in the more saline one (7.20 and 0.60 mu g C cm(-3) h(-1), respectively). High organic carbon enrichment (65 mg C g(dry)(-1)) at Stn A2 probably caused the highest community respiration, estimated by O-2 microprofiles, along with the highest exoenzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase and lipase). The 4 investigated sites were well separated by principal component analysis along a decreasing gradient of organic load. An extremely active microbial community in the contaminated site ensured high production and degradation rates. Correct assessment of the benthic ecosystem functioning in polluted areas may represent a useful tool for transitional system management in order to plan environmental interventions in a rational way.

AB  - The cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has invaded mangrove-dominated habitats in China during the last few decades. However, the ecological effect of the S. alterniflora on the mangrove fish community is poorly understood. In order to assess the relative nutritional contributions of native autotrophs (benthic microalgae: BMA, particulate organic matter: POM, C-3 native mangrove Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia marina and Kandelia obovata) and C-4 exotic S. alterniflora, we examined the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of six common fish species (Osteomugil ophuyseni, Coilia grayii, Parachaeturichthys polynern, Sparus latus, Lateolabrax japonicas and Ophichthus apicalis) in the tidal creek of Zhangjiang Estuary. Results of the MixSIR model suggested that exotic S. alterniflora combined with BMA constituted major food sources of the fish community. S. alterniflora had a higher median contribution than all the other food sources to all fish species except for P. polynerna and S. latus, which derived their major food sources from BMA. These results indicated that the invasive cordgrass has been incorporated into the local aquatic food web through providing important nutrient source for fish species in the mangrove ecosystem of Zhangjiang Estuary.

AB  - Macroalgae contribute to intertidal food webs primarily as detritus, with unclear implications for food web studies using stable isotope analysis. We examined differences in the thallus parts of two South African rhodophytes (Gelidium pristoides and Hypnea spicifera) and changes in overall delta(13)C, delta(15)N signatures and C:N ratios during degradation in both the field and laboratory. We hypothesized that both degrading macroalgal tissue and macroalgal-derived suspended particulate material (SPM) would show negligible changes in delta(13)C, but enriched delta(15)N signatures and lower C:N ratios relative to healthy plants. Only C:N laboratory ratios conformed to predictions, with both species of macroalgae showing decomposition related changes in delta(13)C and significant depletions in delta(15)N in both the field and laboratory. In the laboratory, algal tissue and SPM from each species behaved similarly (though some effects were non-significant) but with differing strengths. Gelidium pristoides delta(13)C increased and C:N ratios decreased over time in tissue and SPM; delta(15)N became depleted only in SPM. Hypnea spicifera, delta(13)C, delta(15)N and C:N ratios all decreased during degradation in both SPM and algae.
   Over 60 days in the field, delta(13)C was depleted in both species (1-2 parts per thousand) and in naturally senescent Gelidium pristoides fronds. delta(15)N was depleted in Hypnea spicifera (approx. 1 parts per thousand), while C:N ratios of both species were unaffected. The two species differed in delta(13)C, delta(15)N and C:N after degradation, but only in C:N beforehand. We suggest isotope changes in the laboratory mainly reflect microbial effects, while in the field these are combined with leaching due to constant water replenishment and agitation. Differences between these two species in the isotope responses to degradation highlight the difficulty of linking the signature of SPM to its multiple sources. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the Upper Triassic, in the western part of Hungary the paleogeographical conditions were favourable for the deposition of formations with high organic matter content. The best reference section of the Kossen Formation can be found in the Keszthely Mountains at Rezi Village: the borehole Rzt-1.
   The alginite sequence of the Kossen facies in he borehole Rzt-1 can De characterized by a moderate organic matter content (average C-org = 6.1%), relatively high carbonate-rich mineral part (average C-carb = 6.1% and relatively low total sulphur content (average S-t(a) = 1.6 %. On the basis of comparison of the previous average values derived from the qualitative analysis of the alginite-bearing samples from the borehole Rzt-1 with others for other Hungarian and Slovakian alginites, it can be established that the carbonate carbon and total sulphur content is higher in the Rezi samples, than in the other Hungarian and Slovakian ones.
   Two changes can be observed in the distribution among the varieties of sulphur in the studied alginite samples from the borehole Rzt-1. Above the interval 181.9-199.6 m the following order:
   pyritic sulphur (S-p(a)) > organic sulphur (S-org(a)) > sulphate sulphur (S-SO4(a)) is characteristic. Between 199.6-233.3 m the order is S-org(a) > S-p(a) > S-SO4(a) and below 233.3 m repeatedly S-p(a) > S-org(a) > S-SO4(a) .
   According to the present and previous studies the alginite sequence of the Kossen facies may, serve as a potential oil-source rock for petroleum found in the Zala basin. Presumably, the greater than or equal to 20 % of the sulphur content belonging to the Nagylengyel-type petroleum might have originated in the Kossen Formation.

AB  - It is widely accepted that mankind derives benefits from ecosystem services provided by the marine environment. It is less clear how these benefits can be quantified in order to make objective and responsible environmental management decisions. Providing an economic quantification of these benefits is one approach that can help. While it is relatively simple to derive monetary values for benefits accruing from activities with an economic basis, such as food provision and tourism, different approaches must be taken to provide economic values for services with less obvious links to economic activity. Here we demonstrate how a range of approaches may be used to derive economic values for three very different ecosystem services provided by marine environments, namely the bioremediation of waste by marine biota, the fixation of carbon dioxide by photosynthetic marine organisms, and the sea defence role provided by wetlands in coastal areas of the UK.

AB  - The stable hydrogen isotope composition (delta D) of major plant biochemicals is variable. We present delta D values for cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin of six plant species. The delta D value for lignin is consistently lower than that of bulk tissue (by similar to 50 parts per thousand) and cellulose (by similar to 100 parts per thousand). We show that these differences can be used to assess the extent of degradation of organic matter from a single source. A decrease in the delta D-bulk of decomposing Spartina alterniflora roots and rhizomes from -72 parts per thousand to -87 parts per thousand was observed over 18 months, reflecting a relative enrichment of lignin content due to the preferential removal of polysaccharides from the detrital material. Similar changes in delta C-13 were observed previously during the degradation of these plant tissues. These findings indicate that the extent of organic matter degradation should be considered when using stable isotope approaches to assess possible sources of organic matter in soils and sediments. We show that the change in delta D-bulk of plant detritus is best described by an exponential equation, which is simpler than the multiple exponential decay (multi-G) model which best describes the change in delta C-13(bulk) of plant detritus. Therefore correcting for isotopic shifts caused by decomposition may be more easily accomplished using delta D. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the effect of a simulated oil spill and its control by means of application of a remediator on the physical and chemical characteristics of a savanna Ultisol soil. Each bag contained 1 kilogram of soil, which was contaminated in an artificial way (20% w/w). After the contamination, the remediator was applied to soil, adding 50 grams. 500 kilograms of 12-24-12/ha was applied. Soil from control; soil contaminated by oil without the remediator and soil contaminated by oil with the remediator were analyzed. The pH, contents of organic matter, magnesium and calcium were similar in the three soils while the clay percentage, aluminum and hydrogen contents were bigger in virgin soil. Contents of phosphorus, potassium, manganese, zinc, copper and iron were smaller in the virgin soil in comparison with the soil with oil and the soil with oil plus remediator.

AB  - 1.  We examined the effects of an emergent macrophyte (Eleocharis sphacelata R. Br., Cyperaceae) and a submerged macrophyte (Vallisneria gigantea Graeb., Hydrocharitaceae) on the biogeochemistry of the sediments of a billabong in south-eastern Australia.
   2.  Sediments from an E. sphacelata bed had significantly lower concentrations of exchangeable phosphorus than did sediments from a nearby bare area or a V. gigantea bed, but neither macrophyte had a measureable effect on their sediment's exchangeable ammonium content.
   3.  The redox potential in the upper 10 cm of E. sphacelata sediments was about 100 mV higher than that of bare sediments, or of sediments colonized by V. gigantea.
   4.  There were few consistent differences between vegetated and bare sediments in terms of the activity of extracellular enzymes, such as alpha-amylase, protease, beta-D glucosidase, lipase or alkaline phosphatase.  Rates of alkaline phosphatase activity (235-306-mu-mol (g dry wt)-1 day-1) were markedly higher than those commonly reported for sediments or soils.
   5.  Rates of gas release were higher from bare sediments (21-93 ml m-2 h-1) than from E. sphacelata or V. gigantea sediments (17-23 and 21-24 ml m-2 h-1, respectively).  Gas bubbles consisted mainly of methane (26-66%) and nitrogen (15-68%).  Rates of methane ebullition varied from 5 to 60 ml m-2 h-1.
   6.  In-vitro methanogenesis was most rapid in samples of the upper flocculent sediment.  Methanogenesis was slower in V. gigantea sediments than in bare area or E. sphacelata sediments, but was markedly accelerated by additions of acetate and/or H2/CO2 in all sites.
   7.  Profiles of total extractable fatty acids and phospholipid fatty acids demonstrated that material derived from higher plants dominated the sediment organic matter in all sites.  Bacteria were also a significant component of sediment organic matter, as fatty acids for which bacteria can be assumed the sole source accounted for 18-30% of total fatty acid content.  Biomarkers for sulphate-reducing bacteria (Desulfobacter spp.) were detected, and for type II methanotrophic bacteria.

AB  - Material flux rates in an intertidal mussel bed were measured synchronously over two tidal cycles in June 1989 with Benthic Ecosystem Tunnels and a double lane flume. The tunnels enclosed the near bottom water, whereas the flume canalized the total water column. One tunnel was set up in a mussel bed and another one in an adjacent sand bottom as a control. The flume enclosed a mussel lane and a sand lane. In the tunnel and in the flume the mussel bed revealed ammonium and phosphate discharge. At the same time, phytoplankton, dominated by Phyaeocystis globosa, was taken up intensively. These flux rates showed the same tendency but they were higher in the flume than in the tunnel. Different tendencies and flux rates for oxygen and particulate organic matter (POC, PN) were found in flume and tunnel. These differences demonstrate the importance of water column processes regarding the material exchange of a mussel bed. Tunnels enclose smaller bodies of water and are therefore expected to detect even small effects of the benthos on the passing water. In flumes, benthic influence may be diluted over the entire water column but conditions are more natural. The use of flumes is restricted to shallow waters while tunnels have the potential to be used at any depth.

AB  - Biological dinitrogen (N-2) fixation is the primary input of fixed nitrogen (N) into the marine biosphere, making it an essential process contributing to the biological functions of all organisms. Because biologically available N often limits marine productivity, microbial processes leading to its loss and gain (e. g. denitrification and N-2 fixation, respectively) play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles. Bioturbation is known to influence benthic N cycling, most often reported as enhancement of denitrification and a subsequent loss of N-2 from the system. N-2 fixation has rarely been addressed in bioturbation studies. Instead, sedimentary N-2 fixation typically has been considered important in relatively rare, localized habitats such as rhizosphere and phototrophic microbial mat environments. However, the potential for N-2 fixation in marine sediments may be more widespread. We show here that nitrogenase activity can be very high (up to 5 nmol C2H4 cm(-3) h(-1)) in coastal sediments bioturbated by the ghost shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis and at depths below 5 cm. Integrated subsurface N-2-fixation rates were greater than those previously found for un-vegetated estuarine sediments and were comparable to rates from photosynthetic microbial mats and rhizospheres. Inhibition experiments and genetic analysis showed that this activity was mainly linked to sulfate reduction. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are widespread and abundant in marine sediments, with many possessing the genetic capacity to fix N-2. Our results show that N-2 fixation by SRB in bioturbated sediments may be an important process leading to new N input into marine sediments. Given the ubiquity of bioturbation and of SRB in marine sediments, this overlooked benthic N-2 fixation may play an important role in marine N and carbon (C) cycles.

AB  - Wetlands provide crucial services to support human populations and intrinsic environmental functioning. They are, therefore, recognised at higher-level global conservation treaties down to regional and local environmental management plans. Palaeorecords to understand preimpact conditions and ranges of natural variability are critical, alongside ongoing monitoring of ecosystem health for understanding important wetlands and determining long-term conservation strategies. They also enable effective analysis of human impacts.
   Towra Point Nature Reserve is an internationally significant wetland complex listed under multiple international conservation agreements, including the 1971 Ramsar Convention. It faces similar challenges to other coastal wetlands globally: sea level rise, changing shoreline conditions, and anthropogenic impacts. Its location within Sydney's Botany Bay results in high potential for pollutants to enter the wetland complex. This makes ongoing monitoring of the ecosystem critically important. This study has found that arsenic, lead and zinc are relatively elevated in the southern part of the embayment, adjacent to an urban area, where concentrations are near to, or exceeding trigger levels (ANZECC/ARMCANZ 2000). In contrast, in the western part of the embayment contaminant levels are well below trigger values. We propose that these trigger levels should be adopted and incorporated into the Towra Point Plan of Management.

AB  - The stage height, dissolved oxygen, and redox potential of the surface water and sediments of an intertidal Texas wetland were evaluated using continuous monitoring techniques. Surface water oxygenation was most drastically affected by photosynthesis, which served to elevate daytime oxygen concentrations compared to those measured at night. Colder temperatures affected dissolved oxygen concentrations by increasing solubility and decreasing heterotrophic consumption. Waters of the San Jacinto River were generally more oxygenated than those in the wetland, and incoming tides typically elevated dissolved oxygen levels unless the tide was in direct conflict with the daily photosynthetic cycle. The redox potentials in the sediments could not be correlated with a daily cycle as was found in the surface waters. Redox potentials in the intertidal zone fluctuated between - 150 mV and 300 mV throughout normal cycles of periodic inundation and exhibited decreasing potentials with depth. Sediments further from the waterline had denser vegetation and exhibited higher redox potentials under similar hydrodynamic loading. During extremely dry periods, redox potentials varied from 300 mV to 600 mV, and deeper sediments were often more oxygenated than sediments closer to the sediment-air interface, due to the higher rates of metabolism in the upper stratum. Rates of oxidation and reduction in the sediments were lognormal and evenly distributed about the steady state, with maximum rates of 300 mV min(-1) during intermittent periods of inundation. The results show that biological carbon oxidation in sediments can entirely deplete oxygen from surface waters overlying the mud flats, that vegetation serves to oxygenate the rhizosphere, and although redox potential changes can be large in the dynamic intertidal zone, large changes are infrequent.

AB  - The effect of an invasive infaunal suspension-feeding bivalve, the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, on benthic inorganic carbon and nutrient fluxes was examined through in situ incubations. Measurements were performed in spring and summer on a tidal sandflat of the Rance estuary (south part of the Western English Channel) colonized by the Manila clam after its deliberate introduction in the 1990's. Benthic inorganic carbon fluxes were measured using light and dark benthic chambers both at emersion and immersion. Benthic nutrient fluxes were measured using dark benthic chambers at immersion. Inorganic carbon (IC) and ammonium sediment release under darkness at immersion reached 5.60 mmol m(-2) h(-1) and 441 mol m(-2) h(-1) respectively for a clam density of 291 ind m(-2). The sediment IC-release under darkness was lower during emersion than during immersion, probably due to the reduced activity of infauna at low tide. Under ambient light, a sediment IC-uptake was systematically measured at emersion, indicating a net autotrophy under the condition of measurements (125 < surface PAR < 1670 mol m(-2) s(-1)), while either sediment IC-uptake or release was measured at immersion according to light variation (20 < underwater PAR < 990 gmol rn(-2) s(-1)). The highest gross community primary production, calculated from highest IC-fluxes at light (i.e. net community production) and highest IC-fluxes at dark (i.e. community respiration), was similar at emersion and immersion and reached 6.2 mmolC m(-2) h(-1). These results suggest that the metabolic activity of the invasive Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum contributes to increase inorganic C and ammonium sediment release. These regenerated nutrients may support microphytobenthic production which appeared particularly high on this intertidal sand flat. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spartina densiflora is a C-4 halophytic species that has proved to have a high invasive potential which derives from its clonal growth and its physiological plasticity to environmental factors, such as salinity. A greenhouse experiment was designed to investigate the synergic effect of 380 and 700 ppm CO2 at 0, 171, and 510 mM NaCl on the growth and the photosynthetic apparatus of S. densiflora by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, gas exchange and photosynthetic pigment concentrations. PEPC activity and total ash, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and zinc concentrations were determined, as well as the C/N ratio. Elevated CO2 stimulated growth of S. densiflora at 0 and 171 mM NaCl external salinity after 90 d of treatment. This growth enhancement was associated with a greater leaf area and improved leaf water relations rather than with variations in net photosynthetic rate (A). Despite the fact that stomatal conductance decreased in response to 700 ppm CO2 after 30 d of treatment, A was not affected. This response of A to elevated CO2 concentration might be explained by an enhanced PEPC carboxylation capacity. On the whole, plant nutrient concentrations declined under elevated CO2, which can be ascribed to the dilution effect caused by an increase in biomass and the higher water content found at 700 ppm CO2. Finally, CO2 and salinity had a marked overall effect on the photochemical (PSII) apparatus and the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments.

AB  - In tropical mangroves, brachyuran crabs have been observed to consume high percentages of leaf litter production. However, questions concerning their ability to assimilate this low-quality food remain, as stable isotope analysis of C and N does not seem to support assimilation. Individuals of the common eastern Australian mangrove grapsid Parasesarma erythodactyla feeding on a mangrove leaf litter or mangrove+microphytobenthos diet developed a significantly higher hepatosomatic index than those with access to only sediment. Lipid biomarker analysis and feeding experiments using C-13 and N-15-enriched mangrove leaf litter confirmed rapid assimilation of mangrove C and N by P. erythodactyla. Eight-week feeding experiments utilizing three food types (mangrove leaf litter, microphytobenthos and prawn muscle) established different food-specific trophic discrimination values (Delta delta C-13 and Delta delta N-15) that are significantly different from those commonly applied to mixing model calculations. The mean Delta delta C-13((crab-mangrove)) of +5.45 parts per thousand was close to the mean and median literature values for grapsid-mangrove pairs in 29 past studies (+5.2 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand and +5.6 parts per thousand, respectively), suggesting that this large discrimination may generally be characteristic of detritivorous grapsid crabs. Solutions from the IsoConc mixing model using our determined trophic discrimination values suggest significantly higher and dominant contributions of mangrove C to the diet than those based on the global mean trophic discrimination values. Our results reaffirm the physiological capacity for and important mediating role of grapsid crabs in processing low-quality mangrove C in tropical estuaries, and caution against the use of global trophic discrimination values in stable isotope analysis of food-web data, especially those involving detritivores. While recent studies have questioned the trophic significance of mangrove detritus in coastal food chains, the contribution of this productive carbon source needs to be re-assessed in the light of these data.

Previous studies suggest magnetic concentration parameters represent an alternative means of normalising for these effects and, given the speed, low-cost and sensitivity of the measurements may, therefore, offer some advantages over other compositional signals. In this work, contemporary sediments from a range of depositional environments have been analysed with regard to their mineral magnetic concentration and textural characteristics, to observe if the strength and nature of the relationship identified in previous studies is universal. Our data shows magnetic parameters (chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM) possess contrasting relationships with standard textural parameters for sediment samples collected from marine (Carmarthen Bay), estuarine (Gwendraeth Estuary) and fluvial (Rivers Gwendraeth Fach and Gwendraeth Fawr) settings. Magnetic concentrations of sediments from both the marine and estuarine environments are highly influenced by the magnetic contribution of finer particle sizes; Gwendraeth Fawr River sediments are influenced by the magnetic contribution of coarser particle sizes, while sediments from the Gwendraeth Fach River are not influenced significantly by any variations in textural properties. These results indicate mineral magnetic measurements have considerable potential as a particle size proxy for particular sedimentary environments, which in certain instances could be useful for geochemical, sediment transport, and sediment provenance studies. However, the data also highlight the importance of fully determining the nature of the relationship between sediment particle size and magnetic properties before applying mineral magnetic data as a particle size proxy.

AB  - Urban development in coastal settings has increased the input of nitrogen into estuaries globally, in many cases changing the composition of estuarine ecosystems. By focussing on three adjacent estuaries with a gradient of anthropogenic N loadings, we used stable isotopes of N and C to test for changes due to increased anthropogenic N input on the structure of some key trophic linkages in estuaries. We found a consistent enrichment in delta N-15 corresponding to increased anthropogenic N at the three ecosystem levels studied: fine benthic organic matter, grazing invertebrate, and planktivorous fish. The degree of enrichment in delta N-15 between fine benthic organic matter and the grapsid crab Parasesarma elythrodactyla was identical across the three sites. The glassfish Ambassis jacksoniensis showed lower levels of enrichment compared to basal food sources at the higher N-loaded sites, suggesting a possible effect of anthropogenic N in decreasing food-chain length in these estuaries.

AB  - Infauna have an intimate relationship with the sediments they inhabit, and any study conducted upon infauna must, at the very least, describe sediment conditions. Common sediment assessments in intertidal systems include particle size distribution, as well as water and organic matter contents. These measures require extracting and processing a sediment core, and this disturbance may result in data that do not necessarily reflect in situ conditions. Sediment penetrability measured in situ using a penetrometer can circumvent this limitation. However, relationships between sediment penetrability and other sediment variables are poorly understood, especially in coastal systems. We evaluated the relationship between sediment penetrability and depth to the apparent redox potential discontinuity, mean particle size, organic matter content, and water content on tidal flats along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Canada. We also assessed whether adding penetrability into environmental models of the infaunal community improved model performance. We observed that while penetrability is statistically related to other sediment variables, relationships to covariates were weak. Further, inclusion of penetrability with other sediment variables improved the performance of models predicting infaunal community composition. Therefore, penetrability can be considered a separate variable, and contributes to an integrated assessment of environmental conditions experienced by biota. Finally, since we evaluated this method in different soft-sediment intertidal ecosystems (mudflats to sandflats), this method is applicable to a range of systems in other geographical areas.

AB  - Tidal Spartina-dominated saltmarshes and estuaries on the Southeast US coast are global hotspots of productivity. In coastal Georgia, tidal amplitudes and saltmarsh productivity are the highest along the Southeast US coast. Coastal Georgia is characterized by a humid subtropical seasonal climate, and inter annual variability in precipitation, and freshwater discharge. The 2012-2013 timeframe encompassed contrasting levels of discharge for the Savannah River, a major Georgia river, with a 4.3-fold greater discharge in summer 2013 relative to summer 2012. In situ measurements of temperature, salinity, precipitation and Secchi depth, and water samples were collected weekly at high tide throughout 2012 and 2013 from the Skidaway River Estuary, a tidal saltmarsh-dominated estuary in coastal Georgia influenced by Savannah River hydrology. The effects of elevated discharge on the seasonal trends of water column components were evaluated. The shift from low discharge (2012) to high discharge (2013) led to decreased salinity in summer 2013, but no significant increases in inorganic nutrient (NH4, NOx, SiO2 and PO4) concentrations. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations decreased, and DIC stable isotopic signatures (delta C-13-DIC values) were depleted in summer 2013 relative to summer 2012. In 2013 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM: CDOM, FDOM) intensities, specific UV-absorbance (SUVA(254)) and relative humic-like fluorescence were all higher than in 2012, indicating that, as discharge increased in 2013, estuarine water became enriched in terrigenous DOM. Secchi depth and particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) concentrations displayed clear seasonal patterns that were not significantly altered by discharge. However, delta C-13-POC and delta N-15-PON isotopic signatures indicated higher terrigenous contributions at elevated discharge. Discharge influenced cyanobacterial composition, but did not affect total abundance of phytoplankton (<52 mu m) or chlorophyll-a concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton community dynamics were primarily seasonally-driven. Bacterioplankton abundance and community composition, based upon flow cytometry, were affected by discharge, possibly due to decreased salinity and/or increased inputs of terrigenous DOM. Seasonal patterns in inorganic nutrient, POC, PON and chlorophyll-a concentrations, and Secchi depth were not significantly influenced by the 2013 increase in discharge. For other components, most notably delta C-13-DIC values, DOM and bacterioplankton, the influence of increased discharge in 2013 was superimposed upon their seasonal patterns. This study showed that in addition to tidal mixing and in situ saltmarsh and estuarine production and removal processes, the level of riverine freshwater discharge impacted the quantity and character of many water column components in this tidal saltmarsh ecosystem.

AB  - In extremely acidic mining sediments of the Lusatian mining district, the alkalinisation process relies on organic C, which can serve as electron donor for microbially induced sulfate reduction. Plant material of the pioneer plant Juncus bulbosus is an important organic matter source in lake sediments. Therefore, decomposition of the plant tissue was assessed during the exposure of litterbags for 30 months in the 0-5 cm layer of waterlogged mining sediments, which have a pH between 2.5 and 3. The ash free dry weight (AFDW) and elemental content of the plant tissue were recorded several times during the exposure. Changes in chemical structure were analyzed by solid-state C-13 cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy and the lignin component characterized by wet-chemical CuO oxidation. The AFDW accounted for about 34% of initial biomass after field exposure for 30 months. Mass loss of biomass occurred in two phases with decomposition rates varying between 30 and 430 mg AFDW d(-1). The mass loss increased considerably after 5-7 months when litterbags were invaded by fresh J. bulbosus plants. With respect to higher mass loss, 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, showed slight changes of the bulk chemical composition after 11 months, indicating that microorganisms present in the sediments or in the rhizosphere degrade plant material as a whole, rather than selectively. During the second phase from about 11 months until the end of the exposure period, contribution of O-alkyl C most probably assignable to easily degradable polysaccharides decreased. In contrast, the contribution of alkyl, aromatic and carboxyl C increased. CuO oxidation showed that the lignin component of J. bulbosus is degraded oxidatively during field exposure. Our results indicate that the exposed plant material is decomposed in the sediment due to changes in sediment conditions that followed plant invasion of the litterbags. It is suggested that the rhizosphere of J. bulbosus by its influence on the redox potential, pH and the microbial component plays a crucial role in organic matter degradation in acidic mining sediments.

AB  - Because groundwater discharge along coastal shorelines is often concentrated in zones inhabited by fringing wetlands, accurately estimating discharge is essential for understanding its effect on the function and maintenance of these ecosystems. Most previous estimates of groundwater discharge to coastal wetlands have been temporally limited and have used only a single approach to estimate discharge. Furthermore, groundwater input has not been considered as a major mechanism controlling pore-water flushing. We estimated seasonally varying groundwater discharge into a fringing estuarine wetland using three independent methods (Darcy's Law, salt balance, and Br- tracer). Seasonal patterns of discharge predicted by both Darcy's Law and the salt balance yielded similar seasonal patterns with discharge maxima and minima in spring and early fall, respectively. They differed, however, in the estimated magnitude of discharge by two- to fourfold in spring and by 10-fold in fall. Darcy estimates of mean discharge ranged between -8.0 and 80 L m(-2) d(-1), whereas the salt balance predicted groundwater discharge of 0.6 to 22 L m(-2) d(-1). Results from the Br- tracer experiment estimated discharge at 16 L m(-2) d(-1), or nearly equal to the salt balance estimate at that time. Based upon the tracer test, pore-water conductivity profiles, and error estimates for the Darcy and salt balance approaches, we concluded that the salt balance provided a more certain estimate of groundwater discharge at high flow (spring). In contrast, the Darcy method provided a more reliable estimate during low flow (fall). Groundwater flushing of pore water in the spring exported solutes to the estuary at rates similar to tidally driven surface exchange seen in previous studies. Based on pore water turnover times, the groundwater-driven fur of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and NK; to the estuary was 11.9, 1.6, and 1.3 g C or g N m(-2) wetland for the 90 d encompassing peak spring discharge. Groundwater-induced flushing of the wetland subsurface therefore represents an important mechanism by which narrow fringing marshes may seasonally relieve salt stress and export material to adjacent water masses.

AB  - To establish if nutrients limit the growth of bivalves requires information not only on the quality of food available, but also the animals' feeding behaviour and endogenous metabolic demands. We hypothesized that growth of the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) would vary in response to seasonal changes in food quality rather than quantity. We also predicted that the oysters would show feeding preferences for nitrogen over carbon, and this behaviour would result in carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios for ingested and absorbed matter that would be lower than the C/N of both the seston and the oysters' estimated metabolic maintenance requirements. The experiments were done in two phases under natural conditions. In phase 1, feeding behaviour was assessed on a single occasion and the results used to pose hypotheses for testing in phase 2, which included measurements made on three occasions encompassing autumn, winter and spring conditions. Growth rates varied with changes in ambient food quality and not with the concentration of total suspended matter. Feeding behaviour responded to food quality and, in most cases, resulted in nitrogen enrichment. For example, when nitrogen was potentially limiting to growth and/or maintenance.. due to high food C/N (July) or high nitrogen demand (March), pre-ingestive selection ensured nitrogen enrichment of ingested matter and UN ratios of ingested matter which were below the maintenance requirement. However, in November, when endogenous demands indicated an increased requirement for carbon, feeding behaviour resulted in carbon enrichment, an increase in carbon conversion efficiency, and ingested C/N ratios greater than the maintenance requirement. The results support the assertion of variable feeding physiology in oysters, responsive to both exogenous (seasonal differences in carbon and nitrogen availability) and endogenous (cycles of reproduction and growth) factors.

AB  - The goal of this study was to explore the possible use of sediment diatoms as environmental indicators in New Jersey coastal lagoons. Diatom samples were collected from 100 sites in Barnegat Bay and Great Bay representing both subtidal and intertidal habitats. A total of 603 diatom taxa were found, with most samples characterized by high species diversity. A strong north-to-south salinity gradient in the study area was a major factor influencing composition of diatom assemblages. Subtidal sediments, especially in highly productive areas in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay, contained a high proportion of planktonic diatoms, especially small-celled Cyclotella and Chaetoceros species. Habitat type and physical properties, such as particle size and depth, were other important factors structuring diatom assemblages. Water-column nutrients and sediment contaminants did not show much effect on sediment diatoms, possibly due to the overriding effect of salinity or low variability in nutrient/ contaminant concentrations. However, the organic matter content of sediments was significantly related to diatom species composition. Both sediment carbon and nitrogen were considerably higher in the northern part of the Barnegat Bay and other areas experiencing strong human impacts. This study developed diatom inference models for salinity and sediment nitrogen content and concluded that diatom species with relatively high optima for sediment nitrogen may be used as indicators of nutrient enrichment in studied lagoons.

AB  - Kinetic parameters of microbial sulfate reduction in intertidal sediments from a freshwater, brackish and marine site of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, the Netherlands) were determined. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 10, 21, and 30 degrees C, using both flow-through reactors containing intact sediment slices and conventional sediment slurries. At the three sites, and for all depth intervals studied (0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 cm), the dependence of potential SRR on the sulfate concentration followed the Michaelis-Menten rate equation. Apparent sulfate half-saturation concentrations, K-m, measured in the flow-through reactor experiments were comparable at the freshwater and marine sites (0.1-0.3 mM), but somewhat higher at the brackish site (0.4-0.9 mM). Maximum potential SRR, R-max, in the 0-4 cm depth interval of the freshwater sediments were similar to those in the 0-6 cm interval of the marine sediments (1046 nmol cm(-3) h(-1) at 21 degrees C), despite much lower in situ sulfate availability and order- of-magnitude lower densities of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), at the freshwater site. Values of R-max in the brackish sediments were lower (3.7-7.6 nmol cm(-3) h(-1) at 21 degrees C), probably due to less labile organic matter, as inferred from higher C-org/N ratios. Inflow solutions supplemented with lactate enhanced potential SRR at all three sites. Slurry incubations systematically yielded higher R-max values than flow-through reactor experiments for the freshwater and brackish sediments, but similar values for the marine sediments. Transport limitation of potential SRR at the freshwater and brackish sites may be related to the lower sediment porosities and SRB densities compared to the marine site. Multiple rate controls, including sulfate availability, organic matter quality, temperature, and SRB abundance, modulate in situ sulfate-reducing activity along the estuarine salinity gradient.

AB  - We measured delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 signatures of natural and translocated mussels Ischadium demissum to identify food web source differences among estuarine marshes displaying various stages of restorative development. We hypothesized that mussels inhabiting younger marshes would be more dependent on allochthonous organic matter sources, while those inhabiting mature marshes would depend on autochthonous sources. Mussels collected from an undisturbed (reference) marsh located within the Napa River estuarine complex in San Francisco Bay were translocated to a series of restoring marsh sites located within the same river system. The isotopic composition of naturally growing mussels was compared with translocated mussels, which were incubated in restoring sites for 5 and 7 mo. Measurements of delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 indicated differences in food web sources supporting L demissum among the 4 marsh sites. A strong cage effect was detected during the initial 5 mo collection interval, indicating that translocated mussels had yet to equilibrate with their new environments. Multiple source mixing model analysis indicated that C-3 emergent vascular plants and brackish phytoplankton contributed most of the organic matter consumed by L demissum over both time periods, but that mussels collected from the downstream sites exhibited higher dependence upon vascular plant detritus. Bay produced phytoplankton contributed very little to L demissum diets, suggesting that the pelagic waters of San Francisco Bay have less influence on marsh food web dynamics than previously anticipated. The results of this experiment show that food web pathways are strongest at intermediate scales; they can be relatively short and unique to specific marshes along the estuarine gradient, but similarities in mussel diets among marshes in close proximity to one another suggests inter-marsh exchange of organic matter. It is, therefore, likely that food webs in young restoration sites depend upon organic matter subsidies from neighboring marshes, rather than from San Francisco Bay.

AB  - Principal component analysis (PCA) and enrichment factor (EF) were used to investigate the trace and major element concentrations in peat soils of Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. The results showed that elements and paleoenvironmental proxies could be divided into four factoring trends in the late Holocene: (1) soil character change (conservative trace elements and chemical changes) (F1), (2) water table change (aerobic/anaerobic changes) (F2), (3) ability of heavy metal storage change (F3), and climate dry/wet change (F4). In addition, carbon accumulation rates were affected by climate dry/wet change and human activities influence in the recent 1000 years. Furthermore, the results suggested that the concentrations of pollution elements were controlled by both nature and human activities. Anthropogenic influences are the main source of heavy metals in the study sites in the last 200 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - The literature has identified significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources due to lack of integration between science, policy and practice. The social and biophysical sciences are an important information source but are often neglected in policy and practice. The literature has identified the science, policy practice gaps as significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources. However, there is lack of research specifically covering the interactions between the three domains. This paper aims to: a) review the literature to identify gaps and related factors or themes contributing to the science-policy-practice disconnect; and b) propose a conceptual integrated model to address those gaps and to increase the uptake of science into policy and practice in coastal systems. The results confirm that there are gaps in the two way-links between science and policy and practice. Most research (64%) is published in the science to policy area, 32% in the policy and practice area, and only four % of the research is published in the science-policy-practice area. Effective integration is inhibited by issues of knowledge, uncertainty, communication, political and cultural issues and institutions or rules and a clear mechanism for linking science, policy and practice is needed. Frameworks may help alleviate the problem but may not be holistic or flexible enough to facilitate interactions across science-policy-practice. There needs to be a clear mechanism for integrating science, policy and practice. To address this a conceptual model of the interactions between science and policy and practice is proposed. The model includes two-way connections between science-policy-practice, mediated by both internal and external factors including key drivers, facilitators, inhibitors and barriers. The model is applied to three case studies, namely: implementing international level blue carbon policy at a local level; an historical perspective on mangrove damage and restoration at an Australian state level; and an Australian example of long-term interactions between science, policy and practice, illustrating how multiple connections and interactions can occur as projects proceed.

AB  - Few field data are yet available to identify factors which control the speciation of dissolved sulphur in marine sedimentary environments, particularly in H2S-poor porewater of deep sediments. The vertical distribution of major sulphur species in the Saguenay Fjord (Canada) sediment porewaters was determined and the influence of bioturbation is discussed. Concentrations of dissolved sulphides and polysulphides (Sigma H2S + Sigma S-n(2-)) in the top cm of sediment were usually very low (<1 mu M). This feature is attributed to the abundance of reactive iron minerals (up to 45 mg g(-1) dry wt) which precipate dissolved sulphides as FeS and FeS2. Under the non steady-state sedimentation conditions encountered near the head of the Fjord, where an organic-poor clay layer was deposited following a landslide 30 years ago, several sulphur species generated by active anaerobic oxidation of organic matter in the indigenous sediments were detected along sulphite (S2O32- + SO32-, elemental sulphur (S-8(0)), and organic sulphides (Sigma RSR) peaked just above the allochtonous clay layer. This peculiar geochemical behaviour is attributed to the sustained bioturbational transport of oxidized particles and molecular oxygen to a zone of active SO42- reduction. These field results provide fresh insights into our general understanding of the speciation of dissolved sulphur in sedimentary marine environments.

AB  - Perennial halophytes are known to be one of the most influential parameters in coastal ecosystem affecting ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in soil microbial community structure and enzyme activities in different halophyte-covered soils (Arthrocnemum indicum, Aeluropus lagopoides, Heleochloa setulosa and Suaeda nudiflora) with control soil (un-vegetated) that were collected in three seasons (rainy, winter and summer) from intertidal coastal soils of Gujarat, India. Soil microbial community structure was assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Halophytes influenced significantly soil micro-environment by exerting effects on the soil chemical characteristics, enzyme activities and microbial community structure. The activities of beta-glucosidase, urease and alkaline phosphatase were significantly higher in halophyte-covered soils than in control soil. Among four halophyte-covered soils, the highest amounts of total, bacterial, actinomycetes and fungal PLFAs were observed in Arthrocnemum soil. The concentrations of total, bacterial, actinomycetes and fungal PLFAs were also significantly higher in summer and winter seasons than in rainy season, whereas enzyme activities also vary with seasons. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis PLFA profiling revealed that the structure of microbial community significantly differed in all seasons as well as between control and halophyte-covered soils. These shifts in microbial community were due to the higher abundance of Gram-positive, total bacterial and actinomycetes PLFAs in summer and winter seasons than in rainy season, whereas abundance of fungal biomarker was significantly higher in rainy season than in other seasons. Among halophytes, significantly higher abundance of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and total bacteria was observed in Arthrocnemum, Heleochloa and Suaeda whereas the lowest in control soil. Halophytes exhibited improved soil microbial activities, which is important for healthy ecosystem. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The influence of groundwater and pore-water exchange on dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in coastal surface waters remains poorly understood. Here, we combine bottom up (i.e., groundwater-derived flux estimates) and top down (i.e., water column response) evidence to assess whether groundwater exchange drives DOM dynamics in shallow coastal waters. We rely on automated chromophoric DOM (CDOM, a proxy for DOM) and radon (Rn-222, groundwater proxy) measurements over tidal time scales in 12 shallow systems, including tidal freshwater wetlands, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, coastal lakes, a saltmarsh, and a residential canal estate. Groundwater-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes ranged from 2 +/- 2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in a coral reef to 1941 +/- 1325 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in a mangrove tidal creek. These groundwater fluxes replaced surface water DOC inventories on time scales ranging from similar to 0.5 d to several weeks. Systems with short replacement times displayed positive correlations between radon and CDOM in surface waters. Groundwater exchange diluted surface water DOC in four systems. Using multiple lines of evidence, we interpreted groundwater to be an important source of DOM to surface waters in 4 out of the 12 systems, including an offshore coral reef lagoon with low surface water DOC concentrations. Groundwater discharge was a negligible source of DOM in systems with high surface water DOC and CDOM concentrations such as tidal freshwater wetlands and coastal lakes. This investigation highlights the high variability in groundwater-derived DOC fluxes and responses in the water column, and demonstrates that submarine groundwater discharge and advective pore-water exchange should be considered in coastal carbon budgets.

AB  - The bar-built Pescadero Estuary in Northern California is a major fish rearing habitat, though recently threatened by near-annual fish kill events, which occur when the estuary transitions from closed to open state. The direct and indirect effects of hydrogen sulfide are suspected to play a role in these mortalities, but the spatial variability of hydrogen sulfide production and its link to fish kills remains poorly understood. Using flow-through reactors containing intact littoral sediment slices, we measured potential sulfate reduction rates, kinetic parameters of microbial sulfate reduction (R-max, the maximum sulfate reduction rate, and Km, the half-saturation constant for sulfate), potential sulfide precipitation rates, and potential hydrogen sulfide export rates to water at four sites in the closed and open states. At all sites, the Michaelis-Menten kinetic rate equation adequately describes the utilization of sulfate by the complex resident microbial communities. We estimate that 94-96% of hydrogen sulfide produced through sulfate reduction precipitates in the sediment and that only 4-6% is exported to water, suggesting that elevated sulfide concentrations in water, which would affect fish through toxicity and oxygen consumption, cannot be responsible for fish deaths. However, the indirect effects of sulfide precipitates, which chemically deplete, contaminate, and acidify the water column during sediment re-suspension and re oxidation in the transition from closed to open state, can be implicated in fish mortalities at Pescadero Estuary.

AB  - Predicting response of microbial communities to pollution requires an underlying understanding of the linkage between microbial community structure and geochemical conditions. Yet, there is scarce information about microbial communities in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-contaminated riverbank sediments. The aim of this study was to characterize bacterial communities in highly PAH-contaminated sediments and establish correlations between bacterial communities and environmental geochemistry of the sediments.
   Sediment core samples were collected from a highly PAH-contaminated site for (1) analysis of geochemical parameters including total nitrogen, total organic matter, moisture, total carbon, sulfate, pH, and PAH concentrations and (2) bacterial enumeration, 16S rDNA-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing.
   Non-metric dimensional scaling analyses revealed that bacterial community composition was strongly influenced by PAH concentration. Sulfate, organic matter, pH, and moisture were also related to community composition. A diverse microbial community was identified by the large number of operational taxonomic units recovered and by phylogenetic analyses. delta-Proteobacteria, firmicutes, and bacteriodetes were the dominant groups recovered. We also observed a high number of phylotypes associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria, some of which have been previously described as important in PAH degradation.
   Our study suggests that, despite intense pollution, bacterial community composition did exhibit temporal and spatial variations and were influenced by sediment geochemistry. Significant relationships between bacterial community composition and PAHs suggest that, potentially, extant microbial communities may contribute to natural attenuation and/or bioremediation of PAHs.

AB  - Although several microorganisms that produce and degrade methanethiol (MT) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) have been isolated from various habitats, little is known about the numbers of these microorganisms in situ. This study reports on the identification and quantification of microorganisms involved in the cycling of MT and DMS in freshwater sediments. Sediment incubation studies revealed that the formation of MT and DMS is well balanced with their degradation. MT formation depends on the concentrations of both sulfide and methyl group-donating compounds. A most-probable number (MPN) dilution series with syringate as the growth substrate showed that methylation of sulfide with methyl groups derived from syringate is a commonly occurring process in situ. MT appeared to be primarily degraded by obligately methylotrophic methanogens, which were found in the highest positive dilutions on DMS and mixed substrates (methanol, trimethylamine [TMA], and DMS). Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the total DNA isolated from the sediments and of the DNA isolated from the highest positive dilutions of the MPN series (mixed substrates) revealed that the methanogens that are responsible for the degradation of MT, DMS, methanol, and TMA in situ are all phylogenetically closely related to Methano-methylovarans hollandica. This was confirmed by sequence analysis of the product obtained from a nested PCR developed for the selective amplification of the 16S rRNA gene from M. hollandica. The data from sediment incubation experiments, MPN series, and molecular-genetics detection correlated well and provide convincing evidence for the suggested mechanisms for MT and DMS cycling and the common presence of the DMS-degrading methanogen M. hollandica in freshwater sediments.

AB  - Mangroves are essential for maintaining local biodiversity and human well-being, and mangrove structure and functioning depend on the macrobenthos. Although exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to the mangrove wetlands (including the associated unvegetated shoals) of China, its effects on the macrobenthic fauna in such wetlands is poorly understood. The macrobenthic faunal communities were compared in (1) an Avicennia marina monoculture vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded A. marina stand (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and in (2) an unvegetated shoal vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded shoal that had rapidly become an S. alterniflora monoculture in Zhanjiang, China. S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased plant density regardless of invaded habitat but significantly increased the contents of total carbon, organic matter, and total sulfur in the sediment only in the unvegetated shoal. The presence of S. alterniflora had little influence on indices of the macrobenthic faunal community in the A. marina monoculture, but significantly decreased the density and biomass of macrobenthic faunal community in the unvegetated shoal. These results indicate that the effects of S. alterniflora on the macrobenthic faunal community depend on which type of mangrove habitat is invaded. The composition of the macrobenthic faunal community was more similar between the invaded and non-invaded A. marina stand than between the invaded and non-invaded unvegetated shoal. Overall, the differences in the macrobenthic faunal community between invaded and non-invaded habitats were associated with increases in the sediment organic matter content and plant density.

AB  - Marine oil spills are catastrophic events that cause massive damage to ecosystems at all trophic levels. While most of the research has focused on carbon-degrading microorganisms, the potential impacts of hydrocarbons on microbes responsible for nitrification have received far less attention. Nitrifiers are sensitive to hydrocarbon toxicity: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea being 100 and 1000 times more sensitive than typical heterotrophs respectively. Field studies have demonstrated the response of nitrifiers to hydrocarbons is highly variable and the loss of nitrification activity in coastal ecosystems can be restored within 1-2 years, which is much shorter than the typical recovery time of whole ecosystems (e.g., up to 20 years). Since the denitrification process is mainly driven by heterotrophs, which are more resistant to hydrocarbon toxicity than nitrifiers, the inhibition of nitrification may slow down the nitrogen turnover and increase ammonia availability, which supports the growth of oil-degrading heterotrophs and possibly various phototrophs. A better understanding of the ecological response of nitrification is paramount in predicting impacts of oil spills on the nitrogen cycle under oil spill conditions, and in improving current bioremediation practices.

AB  - The surface layer of marine sediments is an environment in transition: sediment added to the top of the layer transits to the bottom of the layer and is buried. A complex set of chemical reactions alters the sediment as it transits, lowering the free energy of the system. If a balance can be achieved between the rate of the reactions and the supply of the reactants, the distributions of reactants and reaction products can reach a steady state. Near the sediment-water interface the steady state is rarely achieved, and diagenesis proceeds via a succession of transient states that reflects variable external forcing and involves a multitude of redox reactions whose relative importance can vary in time and space. The transient state can be difficult to observe directly with conventional techniques, and much of what is known comes from indirect evidence. Development and application of new technologies for benthic research and monitoring are needed to advance our understanding of the time variable nature of sediment diagenesis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions and carbon uptake in temperate freshwater wetlands act in opposing directions in the context of global radiative forcing. Large uncertainties exist for the rates of CH4 emissions making it difficult to determine the extent that CH4 emissions counteract the carbon sequestration of wetlands. Urban temperate wetlands are typically small and feature highly heterogeneous land cover, posing an additional challenge to determining their CH4 budget.
   The data analysis approach we introduce here combines two different CH4 flux measurement techniques to overcome scale and heterogeneity problems and determine the overall CH4 budget of a small, heterogeneous, urban wetland landscape. Temporally intermittent point measurements from non steady -state chambers provided information about patch-level heterogeneity of fluxes, while continuous, high temporal resolution flux measurements using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique provided information about the temporal dynamics of the fluxes. Patch-level scaling parameterization was developed from the chamber data to scale eddy covariance data to a 'fixed-frame', which corrects for variability in the spatial coverage of the eddy covariance observation footprint at any single point in time. By combining two measurement techniques at different scales, we addressed shortcomings of both techniques with respect to heterogeneous wetland sites.
   We determined that fluxes observed by the two methods are statistically similar in magnitude when brought to the same temporal and spatial scale. We also found that open-water and macrophyte-covered areas of the wetland followed similar phenological cycles and emitted nearly equivalent levels of CH4 for much of the year. However, vegetated wetland areas regularly exhibited a stronger late-summer emission peak, possibly due to CH4 transport through mature vegetation vascular systems. Normalizing the eddy covariance data to a fixed-frame allowed us to determine the seasonal CH4 budget of each patch and the overall site. Overall, the macrophyte areas had the largest CH4 fluxes followed by the open water areas.
   Uncertainties in the final CH4 budget included spatial heterogeneity of CH4 fluxes, the tower footprint, measurement in the data to be scaled, and gap-filling, Of these, the spatial placement of the chambers provided the largest source of uncertainty in CH4 estimates. This reinforces the need to utilize site-level measurements when estimating CH4 fluxes from wetlands as opposed to using only up-scaled point measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - New York City (NYC) is representative of many vulnerable coastal urban populations, infrastructures, and economies threatened by global sea level rise. The steady loss of marshes in NYC's Jamaica Bay is typical of many urban estuaries worldwide. Essential to the restoration and preservation of these key wetlands is an understanding of their sedimentation. Here we present a reconstruction of the history of mineral and organic sediment fluxes in Jamaica Bay marshes over three centuries, using a combination of density measurements and a detailed accretion model. Accretion rate is calculated using historical land use and pollution markers, through a wide variety of sediment core analyses including geochemical, isotopic, and paleobotanical analyses. We find that, since 1800 CE, urban development dramatically reduced the input of marsh-stabilizing mineral sediment. However, as mineral flux decreased, organic matter flux increased. While this organic accumulation increase allowed vertical accumulation to outpace sea level, reduced mineral content causes structural weakness and edge failure. Marsh integrity now requires mineral sediment addition to both marshes and subsurface channels and borrow pits, a solution applicable to drowning estuaries worldwide. Integration of marsh mineral/organic accretion history with modeling provides parameters for marsh preservation at specific locales with sea level rise.

AB  - Key message Plant-soil feedbacks in mangrove ecosystems are important for ecosystem resilience and can be investigated by establishing links between empirical and modelling studies. Plant-soil feedbacks are important as they provide valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics and ecosystems stability and resilience against multiple stressors and disturbances, including global climate change. In mangroves, plant-soil feedbacks are important for ecosystem resilience in the face of sea level rise, carbon sequestration, and to support successful ecosystem restoration. Despite the recognition of the importance of plant-soil feedbacks in mangroves, there is limited empirical data available. We reviewed empirical studies from mangrove ecosystems and evaluate numerical models addressing plant-soil feedbacks. The empirical evidence suggests that plant-soil feedbacks strongly influence ecological processes (e.g. seedling recruitment and soil elevation change) and forest structure in mangrove ecosystems. Numerical models, which successfully describe plant-soil feedbacks in mangrove and other ecosystems, can be used in future empirical studies to test mechanistic understanding and project outcomes of environmental change. Moreover, the combination of both, modelling and empirical approaches, can improve mechanistic understanding of plant-soil feedbacks and thereby ecosystem dynamics in mangrove ecosystems. This combination will help to support sustainable coastal management and conservation.

AB  - Methane production by methanogens in wetland is recognized as a significant contributor to global warming. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), which is an invasion plant in China's wetland, was reported to have enormous effects on methane production. But studies on shifts in the methanogen community in response to S. alterniflora invasion at temporal and spatial scales in the initial invasion years are rare. Sediments derived from the invasive species S. alterniflora and the native species Phragmites australis (P. australis) in pairwise sites and an invasion chronosequence patch (4 years) were analyzed to investigate the abundance and community structure of methanogens using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) cloning of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) gene. For the pairwise sites, the abundance of methanogens in S. alterniflora soils was lower than that of P. australis soils. For the chronosequence patch, the abundance and diversity of methanogens was highest in the soil subjected to two years invasion, in which we detected some rare groups including Methanocellales and Methanococcales. These results indicated a priming effect at the initial invasion stages of S. alterniflora for microorganisms in the soil, which was also supported by the diverse root exudates. The shifts of methanogen communities after S. alterniflora invasion were due to changes in pH, salinity and sulfate. The results indicate that root exudates from S. alterniflora have a priming effect on methanogens in the initial years after invasion, and the predominate methylotrophic groups (Methanosarcinales) may adapt to the availability of diverse substrates and reflects the potential for high methane production after invasion by S. alterniflora.

AB  - Stable-isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and mercury in a model predator, and associated prey community assessments were used to make inferences regarding food web relationships and how these relationships are influenced by habitat variability and anthropogenic factors. Although interconnected, the three major basins of the Indian River Lagoon system on the Atlantic coast of Florida comprise noticeably different available habitat types with spatially distinct faunal communities and available prey for spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, a model predatory fish species. Water quality, degree of urbanization, human population density, and levels of nitrogen enrichment clearly differ between these representative estuarine basins. The differences can influence feeding ecology and therefore result in different mercury concentrations and different stable-isotope signatures of spotted seatrout between basins. Mercury concentrations in spotted seatrout were greatest in Mosquito Lagoon (ML) and least in the Indian River Lagoon proper (IRL), although concentrations were low for all basins. Spotted seatrout from IRL were carbon-depleted and nitrogen-enriched compared with those from the other basins; this suggests either that the fish's primary source of carbon in IRL is an algae- or phytoplankton-based food web or that the pathway through the food web is shorter there. The delta N-15 values of IRL spotted seatrout were greater than those in the Banana River Lagoon or ML suggesting slightly different trophic positioning of fish in these basins. The greater delta N-15 values in IRL spotted seatrout may also reflect the greater human population density and resultant anthropogenic inputs (e.g., observed higher total nitrogen levels) in IRL compared with the other more pristine basins examined. Understanding species' responses to broad-scale habitat heterogeneity in estuaries and knowing basin-specific differences in stable isotopes, mercury, prey communities, and comprehensive food web relationships will be useful in the future for long-term monitoring of impacts of anthropogenic disturbances and of recovery from restoration efforts.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as estuaries, tidal wetlands and shallow coastal waters are often highly productive and provide important habitats to many recreationally and commercially important fish and invertebrates that use these areas as nursery, feeding and/or reproduction grounds. The diversity of coastlines found worldwide results in differences in types of provisioning and function, and in community structure and trophic organisation. Since almost all coastal fishery species require particular components of the seascapes during specific stages of their life-cycles, it is important to understand the way fish use different habitats throughout ontogeny. Access to rich feeding environments is a key contributor to habitat value, and so knowledge on food webs and feeding relationships, and how these vary over space and time, is central to understanding the importance of the different coastal environments. However, the functional roles of the different habitats in supporting fishery species are still not well understood for most regions. In this study, we review and discuss the available literature to identify key knowledge gaps in the understanding of habitat- and context-specific food webs and trophic interactions supporting fisheries species relying on coastal ecosystems. We use Australia and Australian fisheries species as a case-study, as Australia's extensive coastline encompasses many of the coastal ecosystems and habitats found globally. Given the ever increasing transformation of coastal landscapes by either direct human action or by sea level rise and changing climate, these knowledge gaps need to be urgently addressed for appropriate management and mitigation of various impacts.

AB  - Despite the recognition of the relationship between microbial conditioning and invertebrate feeding, there has been little communication between microbial ecologists and zoologists studying the processing of leaf litter in streams. An appraisal of suitable methods is timely, to encourage workers to critically examine their experimental approach: it is often forgotten that results are determined largely by the methods used. We review some recent studies, emphasizing the application of microbiological and biochemical methods, and discuss some important decisions that must be made in experimental design and implementation. It is recommended that newly fallen, naturally abscissed leaves, bound in leaf packs and tethered to natural substrata, be used in studies attempting to simulate natural leaf decomposition. Drying and leaching leaves under extreme conditions should be avoided. Mass loss should not simply be equated with decomposition; instead, losses of the main types of chemical constituents of plant litter should be quantified. If the aim is to study decomposition rather than merely leaf breakdown, the metabolism of dissolved matter and fine particulate material lost from the decaying leaf must be addressed as well. Appropriate techniques should be used to study microbial assemblages: lipid biomarkers or nucleic-acid methods for assemblage composition, microscopy or biochemical analysis for microbial biomass, [H-3]-thymidine or [H-3]-leucine methods to determine growth rates. Exponential decay curves and processing coefficients should be used cautiously, especially if sample sizes are small and equal throughout the study.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a globally pervasive contaminant with known toxicity to humans and wildlife. Several sources of variation can lead to spatial differences in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species including: biogeochemical processes that influence MeHg production and availability within an organism's home range; trophic positions of consumers and MeHg biomagnification efficiency in food webs; and individual prey preferences that influence diet composition. To better understand spatial variation in MeHg bioaccumulation within a species, we evaluated the effects of habitat biogeochemistry, food web structure, and diet composition in the wetland-obligate California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) at three wetlands along the Petaluma River in northern San Francisco Bay, California, USA. The concentration of MeHg in sediments differed significantly among wetlands. We identified three sediment and porewater measurements that contributed significantly to a discriminant function explaining differences in habitat biogeochemistry among wetlands: the porewater concentration of ferrous iron, the percent organic matter, and the sediment MeHg concentration. Food web structure and biomagnification efficiency were similar among wetlands, with trophic magnification factors for MeHg ranging from 1.84 to 2.59. In addition, regurgitation samples indicated that black rails were dietary generalists with similar diets among wetlands (percent similarity indices > 70%). Given the similarities in diet composition, food web structure, and MeHg biomagnification efficiency among wetlands, we concluded that variation in habitat biogeochemistry and associated sediment MeHg production was the primary driver of differences in MeHg concentrations among black rails from different wetlands.

AB  - Morphological and analytical data corresponding to several profiles from two mangrove systems in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo were examined for evidence of pedogenetic processes. Plant activity exerted a strong effect on the processes occurring in mangrove substrates, especially on the intensity of these processes and, therefore, constitutes one of the major factors involved in the differentiation of sediments and soils. Colonization of substrates by vascular plants leads to drastic changes in physicochemical conditions. The redox processes were much more diverse in the soil than in the sediment (substrate without vegetation); in the former they varied with depth, with oxic or suboxic conditions being observed at the surface and anoxic conditions observed below 30 cm, whereas in the sediment, anoxic conditions were observed throughout. Likewise, the acid-base conditions were more variable in the soils, ranging from strongly acid to neutral, and in the sediment they were close to neutral. Furthermore, different pedogenetic processes were identified: (1) addition of organic matter by accumulation of vegetable debris and dead roots, with formation - in some cases - of a histic epipedon, (2) transfer of soluble iron (Fe2+) towards the surface and precipitation in the form of Fe oxyhydroxide, and transfer of the mineral particles due to the bioturbation caused by activity of crabs, (3) transformation of elements such as iron (gleization) and sulphur (sulphidization). Changes undergone in the mangrove substrates were also characterized by simultaneity and intergradations between pedogenesis and diagenesis, especially in the lowermost layers in which authigenesis appears to intensify. Thus, the presence of smectite minerals in the clay fraction may be attributed to authigenic processes that take place in both soils and sediments. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rooted phanerogam communities in the shallow intertidal and subtidal coastal zone represent productive and healthy ecosystems. Inorganic nutrients are assimilated into seagrass biomass. Much of the organic matter resulting from moribund seagrass is rapidly mineralized, principally by bacteria. The microbial community of the rhizosphere is also highly active due to the supply of organic matter released during photosynthesis. This active sediment community plays an important role through carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycling in maintaining the stability and productivity of seagrass meadows. Over the last two decades, however, seagrass meadows in European coastal areas have declined due to increasing pollution. As eutrophication advances a trasition occurs from rooted phanerogram dominated communities to planktonic algal blooms and/or cyanobacterial blooms. Such changes represent the decline of a stable, high biodiversity habitat to an unstable one dominated by a few species. These changes of community structure can occur rapidly once the internal nutrient and organic matter control cycles are exceeded. A field investigation was undertaken to establish the spatial distribution of bacterial populations of Zostera noltii colonized and uncolonized sediment in the Bassin d'Arcachon, France. Bacteria were enumerated using both plate count and MPN techniques for different functional groups as well as determining the total bacterial populations present. Nitrogen fixation, ammonification, sulphate reduction rates, as well as alkaline phosphatase activity were also determined. Colonization of the Z. noltii roots and rhizomes was studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Results confirmed that higher bacterial populations were present in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii compared to uncolonized sediments. Furthermore, electron microscopy identified the rhizome as the main site of colonization for a diverse range of morphological groups of bacteria. Sulphate reducing bacteria were identified as the key group of bacteria involved in N-fixation in the rhizosphere of Z. noltii. The data will be discussed in relation to the role played by the rhizosphere microflora in supplying and mobilising nutrients in Z. noltii.

AB  - Optical in situ chemical sensors enable sampling intervals and durations that rival acoustic techniques used for measuring currents. Coupling these high-frequency bio-geochemical and physical measurements in estuaries to address ecosystem-scale questions, however, is still comparatively novel. This study investigated how tides affect ecosystem metabolism in a mesotidal estuary in central California (Elkhorn Slough). Dissolved oxygen measurements were used to estimate the terms in a control volume budget for a tidal creek/marsh complex at tidal timescales over several weeks. Respiration rates were 1.6 to 7.3 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1); net community production approached 20 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1). We found that aquatic NCP integrated throughout the creek complex varied significantly over the spring-neap cycle. The intertidal contribution to aquatic metabolism was net heterotrophic during spring tides and generally in balance during neap tides because spring-tide marsh inundation was limited to nighttime, and therefore the marsh could not contribute any primary production to the water column. At the estuary scale, the fortnightly export of oxygen from the main channel to the intertidal was largely balanced by an advective flux up-estuary.

AB  - Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) may be highly enriched in groundwater. However, the contribution of groundwater discharge as a source of CO2 to rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is poorly understood. We performed high resolution measurements of radon (Rn-222, a natural groundwater tracer) and the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in a highly modified tidal creek and estuary (North Creek, Richmond River, New South Wales, Australia) to assess whether CO2 in surface waters was driven by groundwater discharge. A spatial survey revealed increasing Rn-222 activities (up to 17.3 dpm L-1) and pCO(2) (up to 11,151 mu atm) in the upstream direction. The enrichment occurred in a drained coastal acid sulphate soil wetland upstream of a mangrove forest. Time series experiments (24-h) were performed at two stations upstream and downstream of the pCO(2) enrichment area. Upstream measurements demonstrated a significant correlation between pCO(2) and Rn-222 while downstream values resulted in a significant inverse relationship between pCO(2) and dissolved oxygen apparently as a result of respiration in nearby mangroves. Measurements taken 2 days after a 245 mm precipitation event revealed the highest recorded Rn-222 activities (up to 86.1 dpm L-1) and high pCO(2) (up to 11,217 mu atm), showing a strong groundwater influence after flooding. These observations imply that groundwater discharge drove CO2 dynamics at the upstream station while multiple complex processes drove CO2 at the downstream station. A Rn-222 mass balance model demonstrated that groundwater discharge accounted for about 76% of surface water in this floodplain creek. The CO2 evasion rates (799 +/- 225 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were driven primarily by currents rather than wind. Groundwater-derived CO2 fluxes into the creek averaged 1622 mmol m(-2) d(-1), a value twice as high as atmospheric CO2 evasion and consistent with carbon uptake within the creek and down-stream exports. These results demonstrate that groundwater seepage was a major factor driving CO2 evasion to the atmosphere from the creek. Groundwater discharge should be accounted for in CO2 budgets in coastal systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sea-level rise is projected to influence soil carbon (C) stocks in tidal wetland systems. Although soil C and iron cycling are considered to be related in tidal wetlands, the empirical link between root ferric iron [Fe(III)] plaque formation and C decomposition in response to salinity and flooding is scarcely known. Here, we established mesocosms loaded with soils from a tidal freshwater wetland and subjected to three salinity treatments (fresh control, oligohaline, mesohaline) plus three flooding (i.e., flooding water-level height) treatments. Root Fe(III) plaque abundance, C-degrading enzyme activities, and potential C mineralization rates (CMRs) and microbial Fe (III) reduction rates (FeRRs) were simultaneously quantified. The oligohaline treatment elevated root Fe(III) plaque abundance relative to fresh control, while the mesohaline treatment suppressed it. Owing to high abundance of root Fe(III) plaque, microbial Fe(III) reduction predominated C mineralization in the oligohaline treatment (56 +/- 7%). However, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction decreased by up to 25 +/- 5% in the mesohaline treatment due to inhibition by salinity. The potential CMRs increased by 17% from fresh control to oligohaline treatment, but declined by 27% from fresh control to mesohaline treatment. The potential CMRs were affected by potential FeRRs and C-degrading enzyme activities. The latter two were associated with root Fe (III) plaque abundance. These results together showed that root Fe(III) plaque abundance was linked to potential CMRs in response to salinity. Flooding did not affect root Fe(III) plaque abundance and had much less of an effect on potential CMRs compared to salinity. Altogether, root Fe(III) plaque abundance could be as an indicator of C decomposition rates in tidal freshwater wetland soils in response to salinity and flooding. Future C decomposition prediction models under sea-level rise could embed root Fe(III) plaque abundance as an indicator for integrating plant-microbe-soil interaction into models.

AB  - Foraminifera responded to both heavy and light oiling of marshes relative to unoiled control sites by changes to both standing stock and depth of habitation (DOH) in sediment following the 2010 Macondo well blowout. Push cores were taken from the middle marsh at sites classified as unoiled, lightly oiled, and heavily oiled based on concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ([TPAH]). Cores were sliced and stained with rose Bengal to detect live specimens of foraminifera. Short-term, sediment-mixing depths were determined using the penetration depths of excess Th-234, and sedimentary organic carbon and carbonate were measured to distinguish depositional environments. Marsh foraminifera reacted to the highest oil concentration (5,000-18,000 ng/g of TPAH) by reducing standing stock and shortening the DOH compared with the control sites. At a second, less heavily oiled site, foraminifera responded with a shallower DOH, but with a boom in standing stock. Deformed, dead foraminifera occurred in all heavily oiled cores-but not elsewhere. Live foraminifera responded with a population boom at lightly oiled sites with [TPAH] near 1,100 ng/g. Changes in standing stock and DOH with [TPAH] suggest disturbance to the marsh food web, apparently due to oil pollution, and support the use of foraminifera as sentinel species.

AB  - Density and burrow morphology of Uca annulipes were studied at three micro-habitats in a Singapore mangrove. The three micro-habitats were: areas dominated by overhanging prop roots (AR), areas with pneumatophores and underlying cable roots (UR),, and areas of bare substratum (NR). Nine, eleven, and ten 0.25 m(2) quadrats were established. randomly in the AR, UR, and NR habitats, respectively. Sex and size-class of crabs in the quadrats were recorded. Nine burrow morphology dimensions were measured using wax casts of 135 burrows. AR and UR habitats with mean crab densities of 24.0 +/- 9.8 and 25.5 +/- 6.5 crabs m(-2), had significantly more crabs than the NR habitat (7.6 +/- 45.1 crabs m(-2)). We propose that perhaps more, crabs inhabit these two habitats as (1) there is less burrow maintenance cost due to increased substratum stability rendered by the pneumatophores, cable roots, algal mats, and mussel beds; (2) there is more food (i.e., organic matter) present; (3) there could be more refuge from predators. NR and AR habitats' burrow volumes were both smaller than that measured for the UR habitat, indicating that U. annulipes were more active bioturbators in the areas where there are pneumatophores and underlying cable roots than in the sandy areas around the trees. MANOVA results of the six linear burrow variables, crossed with habitat, sex, and size of crabs, showed that male and female crabs excavated burrows that were similar in morphology. Larger-sized crabs excavated larger burrows than smaller crabs. Habitat type affected the size of the chamber diameter in which crabs spend time underground when the tide comes in. Burrow ground-angle (beta) and mid-angle (theta) of males and females were similar; beta (for combined data) did not differ significantly in the three micro-habitats. The theta of NR was larger than that of UR and AR. We speculate that burrows with a greater theta could aid in the survival of the crabs, as more acutely bent burrows provide better refuge from predators, especially in "open" areas such as the NR habitat.

AB  - An understanding of the modern relationship between diatom species and elevation is a prerequisite for using fossil diatoms to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL). We described modern diatom distributions from seven transects covering unvegetated subtidal environments to forested uplands from four tidal wetland sites (Smith Creek, Bone River, Niawiakum River, and Naselle River) of Willapa Bay, Washington, USA. We compared our diatom dataset (320 species from 104 samples) to a series of environmental variables (elevation, grain-size, total organic carbon (TOCSOM), and porewater salinity) using hierarchical clustering and ordination. While no single variable consistently explains variations in diatom assemblages at every site, elevation, salinity, and substrate (mud fraction and (TOCSOM) are variables affecting diatom distribution along our transects. Elevation was the major environmental control of diatom variability (explained 27-39% variance) at four transects (Bone River Transect 1, Niawiakum River Transect 2, Naselle River Transect 1 and 2). Salinity and substrate were the major environmental controls (explained 12-32% variance) of diatom variability at three transects (Niawiakum River Transect 1: salinity; Smith Creek Transect and Bone River Transect 2: (TOCSOM). Analyses of a combined regional dataset of all transects suggest that elevation is the driver of regional diatom variability in Willapa Bay, with salinity and substrate co-varying along an elevation gradient. We identify species with narrow elevation tolerances that can serve as indicator species of specific environments. Despite the site-specific variability of our modern diatom distribution, the regional dataset provides an important dataset that can be used to reconstruct RSL in Willapa Bay.

AB  - To examine the influence of river-borne organic material on estuarine communities, we conducted a dual stable isotope study in an estuary heavily influenced by alluvial runoff. Despite significant alluvial influence, secondary production in Apalachicola Bay depends more upon estuarine primary production than upon a detrital food web supported by floodplain primary production. Two simple mixing models, floodplain-marine and floodplain-estuarine, indicated that the upper limits for the contribution of terrestrial organic matter to estuarine consumer diets averaged 37, 25, and 27% and 20, 19, and 25% for East Bay, Cat Point, and Dry Bar, respectively. Systematic delta(13)C variation of consumer organisms was found for differing locations and attributed to increasing influence of terrestrial organic matter and C-13-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) closer to the river mouth. The delta(34)S data exhibited significant variation with river flow that was attributed to an admixture of terrestrial floodplain detritus with estuarine and marine organic matter. Both delta(13)C and delta(34)S isotope data demonstrated clear distinctions between benthic and water column feeding types. Our results suggest that the estuary is dependent on riverine inflows to provide floodplain detritus during the high-flow period and dissolved nutrients for estuarine primary productivity during the low-flow season. Any alteration of river hydrology may adversely affect estuarine secondary production, especially during the low-flow period when the estuary is dependent on input of dissolved nutrients to maintain a high level of primary productivity.

AB  - We studied pore water seepage and associated nutrient release in the Janssand intertidal sand flat (North Sea) during exposure at low tide. The hydraulic gradient developing at ebb tide between the pore water level in the elevated sand flat and the water level in the tidal gully generated interstitial water flows toward the seepage zone with velocities ranging from 0.5 (March) to 0.9 cm h(-1) (July). Pore water was discharged from an approximately 20 m wide zone near the seaward margin of the flat at rates of 2.4 (March) and 4.2 1 m(-2) d(-1) (July). Nutrient and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations of the seepage water exceeded those measured in the pore water of the upper section of the flat by 10- and 5-fold, respectively. Nutrient effluxes through seepage reached 1100 and 7600 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for NH4, 280 and 2500 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for PO4 and 140 and 1700 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) for Si(OH)4 in March and July, respectively. Benthic flux chambers revealed that nutrients and DIC were released from the still submerged sediment as soon as the ebb tide exposed the upper section of the elevated flat. A conservative estimate based on our measurements suggests that 168 000 1 (March) to 294 000 1 (July) pore water are discharged each day from the sandy northeastern margin of the Janssand (3.5 km length, 70 000 m(2)). Nutrients contained in this water corresponded to 6-25 kg d(-1) (90 to 350 mg m(-2) d(-1)) carbon mineralized during March and 42-223 kg d(-1) (600 to 3200 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during July. Our study indicates that the Janssand intertidal flat does not accumulate organic matter but releases mineralization products that can account for all the organic matter that is potentially filtered through the permeable beds during a tidal cycle. Nutrient fluxes associated with seepage exceeded 5- to 8-fold those fluxes caused by the combined effects of diffusion, advection and bio-irrigation during inundation, emphasizing the importance of sand flat drainage to the nutrient cycles in the Wadden Sea.

AB  - Fluxes of total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) between an intertidal mussel bed and the overlying tidal water were measured with an in situ-flume during 5 tidal cycles in summer 1989. Simultaneous control measurements of phosphorus fluxes were made in a parallel flume lane without cover of mussels. Fluxes of total phosphorus showed an irregular way of release and uptake by the mussel bed, whereas in the control lane release during flood and uptake during ebb tide were observed. DIP was mainly released by the mussel bed. This release of DIP was significantly higher than that of the control lane. Additional flume measurements of DIP-fluxes over a mussel bed - deeper inundated during high tide - were made during 6 tidal cycles in 1986. These measurements showed release processes of DIP during the beginning and the end of the tidal cycles, whereas around high tide, uptake processes were observed, which reflected the interaction of DIP with particles and phytoplankton in the water column. The difference between the concentration of TP and DIP showed the amount of organic phosphorus (OF) bound in particles as well as in dissolved organic matter. On average OP was taken up by the mussel bed, whereas over the control sediment a similar pattern as that for TP was found. During 2 tidal cycles the mussel bed showed a net uptake of TP, during 3 tidal cycles a net release. The different directions of TP-flux were explained by different phytoplankton contents in the water column. Although phytoplankton is only a minor part in total particulate matter, a high amount of phytoplankton increased filtration activity by mussels and led to a distinct input of particulate P from the water column to the mussel bed. During low phytoplankton content the resuspension and diffusion of phosphorus components are not balanced by uptake processes.

AB  - In the subtropics, climate change is pushing woody mangrove forests into herbaceous saltmarshes, altering soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools, with implications for coastal wetland productivity and C and N exports. We quantified total C and N pools, and mobile fractions including extractable mineral N, extractable organic C and N, and active (aerobically mineralizable) C and N, in surface soils (top 7.6 cm) of adjacent mangrove (primarily Avicennia germinans) and saltmarsh (Juncus roemerianus) vegetation zones in tidal wetlands of west-central Florida (USA). We tested whether surface-soil accumulations of C, N, and their potentially mobile fractions are greater in mangrove than in saltmarsh owing to greater accumulations in the mangrove zone of soil organic matter (SOM) and fine mineral particles (C- and N-retaining soil constituents). Extractable organic fractions were 39-45% more concentrated in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soil, and they scaled steeply and positively with SOM and fine mineral particle (silt + clay) concentrations, which themselves were likewise greater in mangrove soil. Elevation may drive this linkage. Mangrove locations were generally at lower elevations, which tended to have greater fine particle content in the surface soil. Active C and extractable mineral N were marginally (p < 0.1) greater in mangrove soil, while active N, total N, and total C showed no statistical differences between zones. Extractable organic C and N fractions composed greater shares of total C and N pools in mangrove than in saltmarsh surface soils, which is meaningful for ecosystem function, as persistent leaching of this fraction can perpetuate nutrient limitation. The active (mineralizable) C and N fractions we observed constituted a relatively small component of total C and N pools, suggesting that mangrove surface soils may export less C and N than would be expected from their large total C and N pools.

AB  - Decomposition of plant matter is a key ecosystem process and considerable research has examined plant litter decay processes in freshwater habitats. Fungi are common inhabitants of the decomposer microbial community and representatives of all major fungal phyla have been identified within freshwater systems. Development and application of quantitative methods over the last several decades have firmly established that fungi are central players in the decomposition of plant litter in freshwaters and are important mediators of energy and nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels. Despite the critical roles that fungi play in carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems, there are notable differences in the types and adaptations of fungal communities between lotic and lentic habitats. These differences can be explained by the wide range of hydrologic, physical, chemical and biological conditions within freshwater systems, all of which can influence the presence, type, and activity of fungal decomposers and their impact on litter decomposition. This paper seeks to provide a brief overview of the types, adaptations, and role of fungi within lotic and lentic freshwater ecosystems, with a particular emphasis on their importance to litter decomposition and the key environmental conditions that impact their growth and decay activities. This discussion will specifically focus on fungal dynamics occurring on plant litter in forested headwater streams and emergent freshwater marshes, since published data concerning their role in these systems is considerably more abundant in comparison to other freshwater habitats.

AB  - Coastal marine sediments are a hotspot of organic matter degradation. Mineralization products of early diagenetic processes accumulate in the pore waters of the sediment, are subject of biological uptake and secondary biogeochemical processes and are released back into the water column via advective and diffusive fluxes across the sediment-water interface. Seven representative sites in the shallow coastal area of the southern Baltic Sea (15-45 m water depth), ranging from permeable sands to fine grained muds, were investigated on a seasonal basis for their key mineralization processes as well as their solid phase and pore water composition to identify the drivers for the variability of early diagenetic processes in the different sediment types. The sandy sediments showed about one order of magnitude lower organic carbon contents compared to the muds, while oxygen uptake rates were similar in both sediment types. Significantly higher oxygen uptake rates were determined in two near-shore muddy sites than in a deeper coastal muddy basin, which is due to higher nutrient loads and the corresponding addition of fresh algal organic matter in the near-shore sites. Pore water concentration profiles in the studied sediments were usually characterized by a typical biogeochemical zonation with oxic, suboxic, and sulfidic zones. An up to 15 cm thick suboxic zone was sustained by downward transport of oxidized material in which dissolved iron and phosphate indicate an intensive reduction of reactive Fe with the release of adsorbed phosphorus. While the geochemical zonation was stable over time in the muds of the studied deeper basin, high variability was observed in the muds of a near-coastal bay probably mainly controlled by sediment mixing activities. The sediments can be characterized by essentially two factors based on their near-surface benthic solute reservoirs: (1) their organic matter mineralization and solute accumulation efficiency and (2) their redox-state. Benthic solute reservoirs in the pore waters of the top decimeter were generally higher in the muddy than in the sandy sediments as the more permeable sands were prone to an intensive exchange between pore water and bottom water. The three studied muddy sites showed great dissimilarities with respect to their predominating redox-sensitive metabolites (dissolved iron, manganese, and sulfide). Surface-near advective transport like irrigation of permeable sands and rearrangement of cohesive muds had a particularly strong influence on early diagenetic processes in the studied sediments and were probably the most important cause for the spatiotemporal variability of their benthic solute reservoirs.

AB  - Sediments in coastal wetlands host communities of phylogenetically diverse primary producers Such as diatoms, cyanobacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, but little is Understood about spatial variation in the composition of these assemblages at the highest taxonomic levels. Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography to quantify taxon-specific pigments, I investigated habitat-linked heterogeneity in microphytobenthic biomass. composition, and diversity within two natural wetland systems from Southern California and tested for differences in community Structure between natural and restored ecosystems, Natural vegetated habitat at Mission Bay had higher concentrations of zeaxanthin (cyanobacteria) and bacteriochlorophyll a (anoxygenic photobacteria) than unvegetated mudflat and creek banks. Organic matter was positively correlated with the concentrations of these pigments. whereas sediment pore water salinity and sand content were generally unrelated to composition. At Tijuana Estuary. community structure was generally similar between mudflat and Spartina marsh at the natural site, but concentrations of chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin (diatoms) were higher in mudflats. Restored wetland similarity with adjacent natural habitat (age 2 yr at Tijuana Estuary and 6 yr at Mission Bay) depended on habitat type and pigment measure. Restored upper intertidal Succulent marsh at Mission Bay was most divergent: it had lower microalgal biomass, a lower concentration of zeaxanthin relative to fucoxanthin, and less bacteriochlorophyll a relative to chlorophyll a than natural habitat. The results Suggest that patches of prokaryotic primary producers coincide with areas of high sediment organic matter and/or hypoxia superimposed on a broadly distributed flora of diatoms across various wetland landscapes.

AB  - Sulfate reduction and iron sulfide mineral formation were investigated in Mississippi River delta and Gulf of Mexico continental shelf and slope sediments.  Sulfate reduction rates and pyrite concentrations generally decrease exponentially with increasing overlying water depth.  This is probably a result of decreasing sedimentation rates and organic carbon concentrations with increasing water depth.  A linear relationship between sulfate reduction rates and organic carbon concentrations as well as normal marine C/S ratios indicate that organic carbon is probably limiting sulfate reduction and iron sulfide mineral formation in this region.  Organic carbon reactivity appears to be substantially higher in Mississippi River delta sediments than in other sediments from this region.
   Mississippi River delta and Texas-Louisiana continental shelf sediments are the primary pyrite burial environments.  Of the total pyrite deposition in the study area (approximately 6 x 10(11) g y-1), about 81 percent is deposited in Texas-Louisiana continental shelf sediments and about 15 percent in Mississippi River delta sediments.  The remaining 4 percent is deposited in sediments on the continental slope and the western and southern continental shelf areas.

AB  - The widespread use of a large range of chemical substances is contributing to the considerable increase in the concentration of trace elements in soils and sediments Furthermore, the accumulation of trace elements in estuarine systems is strongly influenced by the geochemical conditions of the soil, and therefore spatial or temporal changes in these conditions may affect the ability of soils to retain toxic metals The objectives of this study were to establish the geochemical behaviour of trace elements related to Fe and S geochemistry in mangrove soils affected to different degrees and by different types of contamination The study was carried out in 15 soil profiles from different mangrove systems in the State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) Eleven of the mangrove soils were affected by some type of human disturbance, whereas the other four were free from any human interference Redox potential (Eh), pH, total organic carbon content (TOC), total S, total N, and total concentration and partitioning of trace elements were analysed The pH values of the mangrove soils were generally close to neutral, and anoxic conditions predominated Under these geochemical conditions, iron was mainly found in the pyrite fraction, and trace metals were significantly correlated with pyritic-Fe, indicating an important degree of trace metal pyritization However, the degree of pyritization (DTMP) of the trace metals was very different Incorporation of trace elements in the pyritic fraction followed the order Cu, Hg>> Ni> Pb,Zn,Cr The concentration of Zn and Pb in pyritic fraction may have been underestimated since ZnS and PbS are soluble in acid media, and may have been extracted during the steps prior to pyrite extraction We also highlight the need for further studies on the geochemical behavior of Hg and the importance of considering elemental Hg in order to obtain more reliable results

AB  - Iron (III) plaque forms on the roots of wetland plants from the reaction of Fe(II) with O-2 released by roots. Recent laboratory studies have shown that Fe plaque is more rapidly reduced than non-rhizosphere Fe(III) oxides. The goals of the current study were to determine in situ rates of: (i) Fe(III) reduction of root plaque and soil Fe(III) oxides, (ii) root Fe(III) deposition, and (iii) root and soil organic matter decomposition. Iron (III) reduction was investigated using a novel buried-bag technique in which roots and soil were buried in heat-sealed membrane bags (Versapor 200 membrane, pore size = 0.2 mu m) in late fall following plant senescence. Bags were retrieved at monthly intervals for 1 yr to assess changes in total C and Fe mass, Fe mineralogy, Fe(II)[Fe(III) ratio, and the abundances of Fe(II)oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB). The soil C and Fe pools did not change significantly throughout the year, but root C and total root Fe mass decreased by 40 and 70%, respectively. When total Fe losses were adjusted for changes in the ratio of Fe(II)[Fe(III), over 95% of the Fe(III) in the plaque was reduced during the 12-mo study, at a peak rate of 0.6 mg Fe(III) g dry weight(-1) d(-1) (gdw(-1) d(-1)). These estimates exceed the crude estimate of Fe(III) accumulation [0.3 mg Fe(III) g dry weight(-1) d(-1)] on bare-root plants that were transplanted into the wetland for a growing season. We concluded that root plaque has the potential to be reduced as rapidly as it is deposited under field conditions.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico represents the largest marine accidental oil spill in history. It is distinguished from past spills in that it occurred at the greatest depth (1,500 m), the amount of hydrocarbon gas (mostly methane) lost was equivalent to the mass of crude oil released, and dispersants were used for the first time in the deep sea in an attempt to remediate the spill. The spill is also unique in that it has been characterized with an unprecedented level of resolution using next-generation sequencing technologies, especially for the ubiquitous hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities that appeared largely to consume the gases and to degrade a significant fraction of the petroleum. Results have shown an unexpectedly rapid response of deep-sea Gammaproteobacteria to oil and gas and documented a distinct succession correlated with the control of the oil flow and well shut-in. Similar successional events, also involving Gammaproteobacteria, have been observed in nearshore systems as well.

AB  - Oxidation-reduction (redox) condition is an important parameter in the processing of organic carbon sources in wastewater treatment facilities. During the mineralization of organic wastes significant quantities of malodorous gases are produced in each step of wastewater treatment, and can cause potential health hazards and corrosive attack on concrete. Using solid adsorbent preconcentration and gas chromatographic methods, the quantity and composition of reduced malodorous sulfur gases emitted from wastewater sludge as influenced by redox conditions were determined in microcosms representing a redox range from very reducing to slightly aerobic, Hydrogen sulfide was the dominant volatile reduced sulfur compound measured under highly reduced redox conditions. The maximum rate of hydrogen sulfide emission (ng S/g dry sludge/h) was measured in the most reduced treatment (E-H = -220 mV), In contrast, gas samples from sludge suspensions in microcosms maintained at redox potential representing aerobic/anaerobic transition (microaerophilic) zone (E-H = +370 mV) hydrogen sulfide was not detectable, Considerable methanethiol (ng S/g dry sludge/h) and dimethyl sulfide production (ng S/g dry sludge/h) were measured in moderately reduced wastewater sludge. Only low levels (less than 20.0 ng S/g dry sludge/h) of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide emission were evolved at the redox levels studied.

AB  - The chemical nature of nitrogenous compounds in detritus both reflects decay processes and influences rates of detrital decomposition. We followed changes in total, available and refractory nitrogen and amino acids during decay of 6 different species of marine plants and macroalgae. Immobilization of nitrogen occurred only in detritus derived from Spartina patens, probably because the decay rates of all other species were too rapid to allow mechanisms fostering nitrogen incorporation into detritus to exceed nitrogen losses. In vascular plants, nitrogen in whole detritus and detrital cell walls was lost more slowly than detrital carbon; in marine algae, there was little difference between rates of nitrogen and carbon loss. Ratios of amino acids: total nitrogen changed very little during decay, suggesting that the chemical transformation of amino nitrogen into heterocyclic rings did not occur. Pools of available nitrogen, as determined by lability to a bacterial protease and extraction in a neutral detergent, generally declined at a faster rate than pools of refractory nitrogen. In the detritus with the slowest overall rate of organic matter loss, there was little difference between rates of available and refractory nitrogen loss, suggesting that carbon rather than nitrogen was more limiting to decomposers in this species and other vascular plants. In S. alterniflora detritus, the pool of N associated with lignocellulose actually increased in size during decay, probably because nitrogen becomes bound to lignin. A comparison of the decay rates, nitrogen dynamics, and detrital cell wall chemistry of the plants and algae support the central role of detrital chemistry in controlling rates of decomposition and nitrogen turnover.

AB  - Rates of plankton community respiration were measured in surface and bottom waters during spring, summer and autumn in the mesohaline region of Chesapeake Bay, USA. Seasonal patterns of plankton respiration generally followed the annual temperature cycle, with peak rates in July and August of 40 to 70 mug O2 l-1 h-1, which are among the highest values reported in the literature. In addition, strong diel variations in surface water community respiration, with mid-day maxima, were coherent with cycles of irradiance and photosynthesis, suggesting the dependence of community respiration on recently produced organic matter. The range of diel variations in respiration during summer was almost half the annual range in mean rates. Size-fractionated incubations demonstrated the importance of picoplankton (< 3 mum) respiration compared to total rates. On average, picoplankton accounted for most of community respiration in surface waters (56 %) and dominated total rates in the summer pycnocline (89 %). This size fraction was less important in the bottom waters during spring (23 %). Temperature per se as a control on plankton respiration was investigated by comparing rates at in situ temperatures against those measured in temperature-manipulated experiments in spring and summer. Strong relations between respiration and temperature were observed in all cases; least-squares regressions (exponential and linear) for experimental data were not significantly different between seasons, nor between the experiments and the seasonal rates measured at in situ temperatures. These results suggest the absence of significant physiological adaptation and/or selection for temperature optima over the annual cycle. Respiration by bacterioplankton (< 1 mum) exhibited no oxygen dependence down to concentrations of 0.16 mg O2 l-1; however, rates for whole water (unfiltered) declined with decreasing oxygen below 0.8 mg O2 l-1. Evidently, diffusion limited oxygen consumption by proto- and metazoans as well as bacteria associated with detrital particles and organic flocs.

AB  - The effect of the SW Atlantic intertidal burrowing crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata on benthic metabolism, benthic flux, and benthic N cycling processes was investigated through field experiments and in situ benthic chambers incubations. Our experimental results show that the presence and activity of N. granulata and its burrows may affect the direction and magnitude of nutrient benthic fluxes. Bioturbation enhanced ammonium efflux at mudflats, and influx at marshes. The flux of nitrate toward the sediment was stimulated by crabs at light and dark conditions in marshes, but only under light exposure in mudflats. Crab bioturbation stimulated benthic metabolism, N mineralization, nitrification and denitrification potentials in both sites. Crabs seem to have contrasting effects on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) availability between marshes and mudflats, as reflected on benthic DIN flux. This different effect on DIN availability and also the possible different effects of crabs on N-2-fixers organisms could explain the opposite N-2 fixation pattern found for both habitats, since crabs promoted N2 fixation in marshes, but diminished its rate in mudflats. Thus, the results obtained here through manipulative field experiments using benthic chambers suggest that macrofauna may influence the N benthic cycle and DIN fluxes in estuarine sediments. Besides, these macrofauna effects could be context-dependent, being many of them opposite between mudflats and marshes. We concluded that the above mentioned effects and the bioturbation macrophytes interaction may be affecting the dissolved nutrient exportation from marshes to open waters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban roadside particulate air pollution, deposited on tree leaf surfaces (Lime: Tilia europaea; Sycamore: Acer pseudoplatanus), has been monitored (July 2003 to November 2003) by mineral magnetic technologies. The nature of this work is particularly important because particulate pollution affects human health (i.e. cardio-vascular and respiratory systems). Leaves were collected from four roadside locations and a woodland park within the City of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, U.K. Data analyses reveal that significant (p < 0.001) site-specific differences are chiefly attributed to differences in types of traffic management and associated vehicular behaviour, but may also be influenced by the type of vehicular engine (notably diesel) and localised conditions. Moreover, evidence suggests magnetic concentration parameters are a surrogate for particulate air pollution. Given the speed, measurement sensitivity and non-destructive nature of the technique, it is proposed this low-cost approach offers some advantages over other technologies currently used to monitor urban roadside particulate pollution.

AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of sulfur gas fluxes (H2S, COS, CH3SH, DMS, and CS2) at the sediment-air interface were studied in the intertidal Wadden Sea area of Sylt-Romo (Germany/Denmark) during eight measuring campaigns between June 1991 and September 1994. Measurements were performed mainly at four sites in a sheltered intertidal bay of approximately 6 km(2) (Konigshafen) and discontinuously in a wider range of the 400 km(2) Sylt-Romo tidal flat area. In situ fluxes of the S-gases were determined by a dynamic chamber technique focusing on dry sediment periods. Additional experiments were conducted in order to determine changes in S-gas concentrations in the sediment between the surface and 70 cm depth.
   In most cases H2S was the dominant S-gas emitted from the sediment to the atmosphere, contributing up to 70% of the total S-emission at this interface. Mean H2S emission rates ranged between 0.07 and 9.95 mu gSm(-2)h(-1). Both emission rates and relative contribution of H2S were lowest from fine sand and highest from muddy sites. Diurnal variation of H2S emission was evident in summer and fall with up to 10-fold higher rates during night than during the day. Distinct seasonal variation of H2S-transfer between the sediment and the atmosphere was observed with higher emission rates in the summer than in spring or fall. The emission of H2S to the atmosphere was smaller by a factor of 1600-26000 than the H2S produced from sulfate reduction. Apparently, the efficiency by which H2S produced in the sediment is retained and reoxidized by biogeochemical sediment processes is extremely high. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) was emitted with relatively constant rates in space and time with mean Aux rates ranging between 0.24 and 2.0 mu g S m(-2) h(-1). Carbon disulfide emission rates were comparable to those of COS and Varied between 0.3 and 2.23 mu gSm-(2)h(-1). DMS played a minor role in the S-gas transfer from uncovered sediment areas contributing between 3.1 and 23% to total S-emission from the sediment to the atmosphere. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Cause-effect sediment-quality benchmarks for the protection of benthic invertebrates are needed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to support predictive risk assessments and retrospective evaluations of the causes of observed sediment toxicity. An in-depth evaluation of PCB aquatic toxicity and organic carbon partitioning was conducted to predict sediment effect concentrations using the equilibrium partitioning (EqP) approach. This evaluation was limited to invertebrate toxicity data, because PCBs may exert toxicity to invertebrates and fish via different toxicological mechanisms. As a result of differences in organic carbon partitioning among PCBs of differing levels of chlorination, the estimated EqP benchmarks increase with increasing degree of chlorination for various commercial and environmental PCB mixtures. Studies of spiked sediment toxicity using PCBs were reviewed, and their results generally were consistent with EqP predictions. Additionally, toxicity and benthic community data were reviewed for eight PCB-contaminated sites; these data also showed agreement with EqP predictions. None of these lines of evidence supports previously proposed, empirical sediment-quality guidelines for PCBs. Reasons for the lack of agreement between cause-effect and association-based benchmarks are discussed, and areas of future research to further refine EqP predictions for PCBs are identified.

AB  - Robust sediment quality criteria require chemistry and toxicity date predictive of concentrations where population/community response should occur under known geochemical conditions. Understanding kinetic and geochemical effects on toxicant bioavailability is key, and these are influenced by infaunal sediment bioturbation. This study used fine scale sediment and porewater measurement of contrasting infaunal effects on carbon-normalized SEM-AVS to evaluate safe or potentially toxic nickel concentrations in a high-binding Spartina saltmarsh sediment (4%TOC; 35-45 mu mol-S2-.g(-1)). Two crustaceans producing sharply contrasting bioturbation - the copepod Amphiascus tenuiremis and amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus - were cultured in oxic to anoxic sediments with SEM[Ni]-AVS, TOC, porewater [Ni], and porewater DOC measured weekly. From 180 to 750 mu g-Ni.g(-1) Sediment, amphipod bioturbation reduced [AVS] and enhanced porewater [Ni]. Significant amphipod uptake, mortality, and growth-depression occurred at the higher sediment [Ni] even when [SEM-AVS]/f(oc) suggested acceptable risk. Less bioturbative copepods produced higher AVS and porewater DOC but exhibited net population growth despite porewater [Ni] 1.3-1.7x their aqueous [Ni] LOEC. Copepod aqueous tests with/without dissolved organic matter showed significant aqueous DOC protection, which suggests porewater DOC attenuates sediment Ni toxicity: The SEM[Ni]-AVS relationship was predictive of acceptable risk for copepods at the important population-growth level.

AB  - Previous studies of Louisiana estuaries have indicated a central role of Spartina alterniflora marshes in supporting production of the commercially important brown shrimp, Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Brown shrimp are an estuarine-dependent species and spend one to three springtime months in estuaries as small juveniles, with highest shrimp densities found at marsh edges. Later estuarine and offshore production of brown shrimp is correlated both with marsh area and with abundance of smaller juveniles found in unvegetated open bays near marshes. This paper investigates the idea that open bays are an additional important nursery habitat for Louisiana brown shrimp, with bays possibly supporting the bulk of shrimp populations even while shrimp densities expressed on a square meter basis are lower in the bays. To assay possible differences in shrimp abundances and residency in marsh ponds vs. adjacent open bays, springtime field work was conducted in 2004-2006 near the Louisiana University Marine Consortium Laboratory at Cocodrie, Louisiana. Seine surveys showed similar-sized shrimp were present in marsh ponds (< 20 m in diameter) and an adjacent open bay (< 1 m deep, 2 km in diameter) and that shrimp were twice as dense in the marsh ponds. Natural C, N, and S isotope tags provided distinctive labeling of shrimp from marsh ponds versus bays; shrimp residency appeared high in both areas with < 10% of shrimp present as immigrants from other areas. Widely spaced collections from several Louisiana bay systems and also Galveston Bay, Texas showed that the S isotope tags provided the most general tags for marsh origins, with low S isotope values of 1-9 parts per thousand in shrimp muscle tissue consistently indicating marsh origins. Importance of marshes for brown shrimp production across Terrebonne and Barataria Bays, Louisiana was evaluated with S isotopes using spring 2005 collections. Results showed that marshes supported about 1/3 of total shrimp production; 2/3 of Louisiana brown estuarine shrimp production may depend on the three to four times more extensive open bays. Given these results, coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana might focus on measures such as barrier island conservation and restoration that protect both bays and marshes, rather than focusing on measures that specifically target marshes and neglect open bays.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are crucial to global climate change due to their roles in modulating atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (CO2, CH4, N2O). Under a warming climate, we investigated spatial and temporal variations of GHGs emissions over the coastal wetlands in southeastern China during 2012-2014. Five dominant land cover types in coastal wetlands have been considered, including the bare mud flat (BF), the Spartina alterniflora flats (SAF), the Suaeda glauca flats (SGF), the Phragmites australis flat (PAF), and the Scripus triqueter flat (STF). The results showed that the annual average CO2 fluxes were 305.8, 588.8, 370.2, and 136.5 mg m(-2) h(-1) from spring to winter. CH4 fluxes presented to be a sink in spring (-0.02 mg m(-2) h(-1)), and functioned as a source in the following seasons. Correlation analysis indicated that the surface air temperature and the cumulative precipitation could be two main factors that influenced the seasonal and inter-annual variations of GHGs emissions. In addition, we provided a regional budget of GHGs emissions that suggested the variations of GHGs emissions under a warming climate.

AB  - The trophic structure of the benthic ecosystem of the Grande Vasiere (Great Mud Bank), a heavily trawled area in the Bay of Biscay, is largely unknown. To better understand the biotic interactions between exploited species (mainly Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and European hake, Merluccius merluccius) and their competitors and prey, we applied a dual stable carbon (C-13/C-12) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14) isotope analysis to determine trophic levels and differences in the potential food sources of species in the benthic and demersal communities. Five main groups of species constitute the basis of the trophic structure. They are distributed in three main trophic levels: primary consumers; secondary consumers including N. norvegicus and juvenile M. merluccius; and top predators including adult M. merluccius (delta(15)N = 14.5 parts per thousand). The large differences in delta(13)C values within the primary consumers attest to two different food components: a pelagic component composed of fresh sedimenting particulate organic matter, which mainly supplies supra- and epi-benthic suspension feeders, and zooplankton, and a benthic component, which mainly supplies deposit feeders. For the predators, the target species, and their competitors, diet changes during the life-span are reflected by differences in isotope values for the size classes.

AB  - A chemical and microbiological investigation was performed to determine ecological impact in sediments below a new offshore mariculture operation on the southwest coast of Oahu, Hawaii. Sediment samples collected directly below the fish enclosures were compared with sediment collected 300 m upcurrent. Total organic carbon was 25-37% higher in the control compared with cage samples and ammonia was 30-46% higher in cage samples. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) counts were 36% higher in cage sample sediments.
   Genomic 16S rDNA was PCR amplified from total DNA extracted from sediments and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Similar gradient profiles for control and cage samples were observed. Cloned 16S rDNA libraries for species sampling and determination indicate similar and diverse bacterial communities. Bacteria belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria class were frequently represented and atypical or pathogenic bacterial species were not detected.
   A mathematical model developed for prediction of organic material deposition suggests that while currents will reduce fecal loading and feed deposition beneath a cage, there is expected to be sufficient nutrient addition to impact those sediments. Time series or statistical information on the current field beneath the fish cages are needed to apply the model for predicting locations of high deposition. This would contribute to the development of a comprehensive monitoring program that would sample multiple locations over time to generate an accurate and comprehensive depiction of the environmental impacts of this new and expanding commercial endeavor.

AB  - The availability of in situ spectrophotometers, such as the S::CAN spectro:: lyser, has expanded the possibilities for high-frequency water quality data collection. However, biological and chemical fouling can degrade the performance of in situ spectrophotometers, especially in saline environments with rapid flow rates. A complex freshwater washing system has been previously designed to reduce chemical fouling for the S::CAN spectro::lyser spectrophotometer. In the current study, we present a simpler, cheaper alternative: the attachment of a sacrificial zinc anode. Results are presented detailing the S::CAN spectro::lyser performance with and without the addition of the sacrificial anode. Attachment of the zinc anode provided efficient corrosion protection during 2-wk deployments in a highly dynamic (average tidal range, 2.5 m) saline tidal saltmarsh creek at Groves Creek, Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, Savannah, GA.

AB  - It is well established that aboveground-belowground interactions moderate ecosystem functioning. The direct and indirect effects of plants on belowground communities have been explored by many studies; however, few studies have considered how grazing moderate the direction and intensity of these effects. In this study, we explored how grazing by yak moderates the effect of the shrub Dasiphora fruticosa on nematode communities through a short-term shrub removal experiment in a grazed and ungrazed alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess both the direct effects of D. fruticosa and indirect effects mediated by changes in understorey vegetation composition and edaphic properties, on nematode communities. The presence of D. fruticosa had no significant impact on the abundance of nematodes in the ungrazed meadow. By contrast, D. fruticosa had a strong negative direct effect on nematode abundance, but also a positive indirect effect due to greater grass biomass, in the grazed meadow. The effect of D. fruticosa on nematode community composition was limited, with only a marginally significant direct effect on nematode community composition in the grazed meadow. Instead, nematode community composition was strongly related to soil water content and organic matter content in both grazing treatments, and soil pH in the grazed meadow. Our results indicate that grazing moderate aboveground-belowground linkages through direct and indirect shrub effects on nematode abundance, but have limited effects on nematode community composition.

AB  - Modern foraminiferal assemblage zones can be used to reconstruct palaeo sea levels when applied to fossil foraminifera down a sediment core. Previous intertidal foraminiferal studies have predominantly focused on assemblages in surface sediments (0-1 cm), with the rationale that surface assemblages reflect the modern-day environment. Foraminifera live infaunally and therefore there is a need to document the infaunal vertical distribution of living foraminifera to fully capture the modern environment. Infaunal foraminiferal populations may compositionally differ from or be similar to those in the uppermost 1 cm of a core sample, but abundance is variable vertically, making it very complex to reconstruct and interpret past sea levels. This can have implications for the choice of assemblages to use as modern analogues for past sea-level reconstructions. This study documents the vertical infaunal distribution of living foraminifera, to allow for more informed interpretations of palaeo-reconstructions in mangrove environments. The down-core vertical distribution and abundance of living foraminifera, along with grain size and organic content, were documented using sediment cores along an elevational transect. Nine taxa were recorded as living at the time of collection, six of which were restricted to the top 4 cm. The majority of these were calcareous and found in the cores situated closer to the intertidal channel. Therefore, we argue that the diversity of living calcareous and agglutinated foraminifera could be restricted by grain size, with coarser grain sizes associated with lower species diversity. The findings suggest that foraminiferal species inhabiting the top 4 cm represent deeper living foraminiferal populations. Therefore, the top 4-cm interval can be used to establish a modern training set upon which reconstructions can be based. The findings from this study will provide guidance on the use of South African mangrove environments for future sea-level reconstructions.

AB  - In a saltmarsh in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Spartina alterniflora had a 5 month growing period. Shoot extension was highest between July and August, and the largest number of leaves were added between June and July. Some leaves began to senesce in the first month of the growing season, but over 50% remained alive until September. Approximately 20% of the leaves became detached from the plant between May and December. Between September and December (snowfall), such leaves lost over 60% of their mass. Compared to predried leaves in litterbags, naturally decaying leaves accumulated more fungal species (16 vs. 9) and ergosterol (up to 125 mu g g(-1) vs. less than or equal to 50 mu g g(-1)), and fewer bacteria. Losses of mass, phenolics, and sugars in the first 14 days were higher in litterbag leaves.

AB  - Physical and biological processes controlling spatial and temporal variations in material concentration and exchange between the Southern Everglades wetlands and Florida Bay were studied for 2.5 years in three of the five major creek systems draining the watershed. Daily total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) fluxes were measured for 2 years in Taylor River, and ten 10-day intensive studies were conducted in this creek to estimate the seasonal flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), total organic carbon (TOC), and suspended matter. Four 10-day studies were conducted simultaneously in Taylor, McCormick, and Trout Creeks to study the spatial variation in concentration and flux. The annual fluxes of TOC, TN, and TP from the Southern Everglades were estimated from regression equations. The Southern Everglades watershed, a 460-km(2) area that includes Taylor Slough and the area south of the C-111 canal, exported 7.1 g C m(-2), 0.46 g N m(-2), 0.007 g P m(-2), annually. Everglades P flux is three to four orders of magnitude lower than published flux estimates from wetlands influenced by terrigenous sedimentary inputs. These low P flux values reflect both the inherently low P content of Everglades surface water and the efficiency of Everglades carbonate sediments and biota in conserving and recycling this limiting nutrient. The seasonal variation of freshwater input to the watershed was responsible for major temporal variations in N, P, and C export to Florida Bay; approximately 99% of the export occurred during the rainy season. Wind-driven forcing was most important during the later stages of the dry season when low freshwater head coincided with southerly winds, resulting in a net import of water and materials into the wetlands. We also observed an east to west decrease in TN: TP ratio from 212: 1 to 127: 1. Major spatial gradients in N: P ratios and nutrient concentration and flux among the creek were consistent with the westward decrease in surface water runoff from the P-limited Everglades and increased advection of relatively P-rich Gulf of Mexico (GOM) waters into Florida Bay. Comparison of measured nutrient flux from Everglades surface water inputs from this study with published estimates of other sources of nutrients to Florida Bay (i.e. atmospheric deposition.. anthropogenic inputs from the Florida Keys, advection from the GOM) show that Everglades runoff represents only 2% of N inputs and 0.5% of P input to Florida Bay.

AB  - The abundance of ammonia-oxidising bacterial (AOB) and ammonia-oxidising archaeal (AOA) (amoA) genes and ammonia oxidation rates were compared bimonthly from July 2008 to May 2011 in 4 contrasting coastal sediments in the western English Channel. Despite a higher abundance of AOA amoA genes within all sediments and at all time-points, rates of ammonia oxidation correlated with AOB and not AOA amoA gene abundance. Sediment type was a major factor in determining both AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB community structure, possibly due to deeper oxygen penetration into the sandier sediments, increasing the area available for ammonia oxidation. Decreases in AOB amoA gene abundance were evident during summer and autumn, with maximum abundance and ammonia oxidation rates occurring in winter and early spring. PCR-DGGE of AOB amoA genes indicated that no seasonal changes to community composition occurred; however, a gradual movement in community composition occurred at 3 of the sites studied. The lack of correlation between AOA amoA gene abundance and ammonium oxidation rates, or any other environmental variable measured, may be related to the higher spatial variation amongst measurements, obscuring temporal trends, or the bimonthly sampling, which may have been too infrequent to capture temporal variability in the deposition of fresh organic matter. Alternatively, AOA may respond to changing substrate concentrations by an increase or decrease in transcript rather than gene abundance.

AB  - Stable isotopes were used to evaluate the hypothesis that fish assemblages occurring in shallow and deep areas of a large coastal lagoon are structured in partially segregated trophic modules with consumers showing contrasting reliance on benthic or pelagic food sources. The results revealed that fishes in deep areas were mainly dependent on particulate organic matter in the sediment (SOM), whereas emergent macrophytes were as important as SOM to fish consumers in shallow areas. Conceptual trophic diagrams depicting relationships among basal food sources and consumers in different regions of the lagoon highlighted the greater use of multiple basal food sources by more feeding mode functional guilds in shallow water compared with the use of predominantly benthic resources (SOM) in deep areas. The findings appear to corroborate the initial hypothesis and offer complementary perspectives in understanding the role of spatial ecology in structuring coastal ecosystem function and productivity.

AB  - Surface elevation and microtopography of coastal wetlands are important attributes with respect to the adaptation to sea level change. While the total increase in elevation determines if a wetland can keep up with sea level rise, microtopography impacts, inter alia, hydrological patterns, which again drive surface elevation changes. We analyzed the dynamics of surface morphology during the course of one year at five locations along a transect from land (interior zone) to sea (fringe zone) in a coastal Phragmites wetland at the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (Southern Baltic Sea) using a modified Surface-Elevation Table. Landwards this wetland is confined by a dyke while the seaward boundary of the wetland is formed by a micro-cliff. A small strip between the interior and the fringe zone is characterized by small basins (basin zone). Surface elevation changes in the wetland interior are mainly driven by its own productivity. Litter accumulation by the dense Phragmites stands is high, but a combination of high organic sediments and water scarcity led to compaction and counteracted vertical accretion. While the surface elevations of the measurement location in the basin zone and one of the locations in the interior zone remained fairly stable (intra-annual changes<+/- 0.8 mm), the other location in the interior showed a drastic decrease in surface elevation (-3.3 cm year(-1)). This large deviation may have been caused by the high spatial variability of sediment organic matter. The micro-cliff eroded constantly (3.7 cm year(-1)); its steepness and surface roughness increased making it more vulnerable to the forces of the sea. The micro-cliff protects the wetland interior from flooding but at the same time suppresses allogenic sediment input. The simple approach to use freely available water level data to predict morphological changes in the fringe zone did not yield significant model results. However, the strong intra-annual variability in elevation change especially in the fringe zone showed that short-term changes may often mask long-term trends. Although we cannot predict long-term developments from our relatively short-term measurements, our results indicate that wetland evolution in such squeezed environments is threatened. In dyked wetlands sediment supply from the land is suppressed and lateral erosion at the seaward edge leads to marsh retreat. None of the measuring locations is currently keeping up with local sea level rise. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We studied the export of inorganic carbon and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a Danish freshwater wetland. The wetland is situated in an agricultural catchment area and is recharged by groundwater enriched with nitrate (NO3-) (similar to 1000 mu M). NO3- in recharging groundwater was reduced (57.5 mol NO3- m(-2) yr(-1)) within a narrow zone of the wetland. Congruently, the annual efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the sediment was 19.1 mol C m(-2) when estimated from monthly in situ measurements. In comparison the CO2 efflux was 4.8 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) further out in the wetland, where no NO3- reduction occurred. Annual exports of inorganic carbon in groundwater and surface water was 78.4 mol C m(-2) and 6.1 mol C m(-2) at the two sites, respectively. N2O efflux from the sedimenst was detectable on five out of twelve sampling dates and was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in the NO3- reduction zone (0.35-9.40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), range of monthly means) than in the zone without NO3- reduction (0.21-0.41 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)). No loss of dissolved N2O could be measured. Total annual export of N2O was not estimated. The reduction of oxygen (O-2) in groundwater was minor throughout the wetland and did not exceed 0.2 mol O-2 m(-2) yr(-1). Sulfate (SO4--) was reduced in groundwater (2.1 mol SO4-- m(-2) yr(-1)) in the zone without NO3- reduction. Although the NO3- in our wetland can be reduced along several pathways our results strongly suggest that NO3- loading of freshwater wetlands disturb the carbon balance of such areas, resulting in an accelerated loss of inorganic carbon in gaseous and dissolved forms.

AB  - Differences in methylmercury (CH3Hg) production normalized to the sulfate reduction rate (SRR) in various species of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were quantified in pure cultures and in marine sediment slurries in order to determine if SRB strains which differ phylogenetically methylate mercury (Hg) at similar rates. Cultures representing five genera of the SRB (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Desulfobulbus propionicus, Desulfococcus multivorans, Desulfobacter sp, strain BG-8, and Desulfobacterium sp, strain BG-33) were grown in a strictly anoxic, minimal medium that received a dose of inorganic Bg 120 h after inoculation, The mercury methylation rates (MMR) normalized per cell were up to 3 orders of magnitude higher in pure cultures of members of SRB groups capable of acetate utilization (e.g., the family Desulfobacteriaceae) than in pure cultures of members of groups that are not able to use acetate (e.g., the family Desulfovibrionaceae). Little or no Hg methylation was observed in cultures of Desulfobacterium or Desulfovibrio strains in the absence of sulfate, indicating that Hg methylation was coupled to respiration in these strains, Mercury methylation, sulfate reduction, and the identities of sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine sediment slurries were also studied. Sulfate-reducing consortia were identified by using group-specific oligonucleotide probes that targeted the 16S rRNA molecule. Acetate-amended slurries, which were dominated by members of the Desulfobacterium and Desulfobacter groups, exhibited a pronounced ability to methylate Ng when the MMR were normalized to the SRR, while lactate-amended and control slurries had normalized MMR that were not statistically different. Collectively, the results of pure-culture and amended-sediment experiments suggest that members of the family Desulfobacteriaceae have a greater potential to methylate Ng than members of the family Desulfovibrionaceae have when the MMR are normalized to the SRR Hg methylation potential may be related to genetic composition and/or carbon metabolism in the SRB, Furthermore, we found that in marine sediments that are rich in organic matter and dissolved sulfide rapid CH3Hg accumulation is coupled to rapid sulfate reduction. The observations described above have broad implications for understanding the control of CH3Hg formation and for developing remediation strategies For Hg-contaminated sediments.

AB  - An in-situ sampler was employed to monitor seasonal changes in the composition of pore-waters at different depths in a mud-flat located in the central part of the Lagoon of Venice, in proximity of the industrial area of Porto Marghera. The use of voltammetric methods of analysis allowed the simultaneous determination of concentrations of reduced S(-II), thiosulphate, Fe(II) and Mn(LI) as well as zinc, lead, cadmium and copper ions. Other parameters such as the concentration of sulphate, Eh, pH and conductivity were also measured. Seasonal increases of S(-II) and Fe(II) concentrations in summer and autumn samples were observed, with the highest concentrations located at about 25 and 55 cm depth, respectively. An opposite seasonal dependence was observed for Mn(II) and S2O32- concentrations, which displayed higher values in winter. the highest concentrations were observed at a depth of 45 cm for Mn(II) and of 65 cm for thiosulphate. The concentrations of Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn ions showed a less evident seasonal variability. Top and bottom samples revealed high concentration values for zinc and copper ions, with the highest values in the 1,000-1,600 nM and 100-300 nM ranges, respectively. Cadmium and lead ions were present at lower concentrations, always less than 70 nM and 30 nM, respectively. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Lateral movements of materials and energy in coastal wetlands, due mainly to tidal activities, have been recognized as key processes in understanding the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems. However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.

AB  - No-till (NT) practices usually increase the P content in soil surfaces. The main purpose of this work was to study the long-term effects of the soil tillage system on the P release potential in the surface layer of a Vertisol from southwest Spain and to correlate it with changes in P content and forms. The three tillage treatments investigated were: (i) conventional tillage (CT) with a moldboard plow and field cultivator; (ii) minimum tillage (MT) with a field cultivator; and (iii) NT, which involved direct sowing into crop residue from the previous year. After 21 yr, NT resulted in enhanced organic matter, Olsen P, organic P, and total P contents relative to CT and MT in the top 5 cm of soil. The ratio of labile inorganic P fractions to P related to sparingly soluble pedogenic Ca phosphates in the surface soil layer was much greater under NT (0.8) than under CT (0.57) or MT (0.55). This was ascribed to a decreased precipitation of sparingly soluble Ca phosphate because of the enrichment in organic matter under NT, and accounted in part for the higher portion of inorganic P related to labile fractions in NT (0.19 vs. 0.09 in CT and 0.10 in MT). The increased P release potential of surface soil as estimated by using P sinks indicated that an increased dissolved P concentration in runoff and a greater amount of potentially releasable P per unit mass of surface soil lost through erosive processes can be expected with NT than with MT or CT.

AB  - Evidence suggests that the invasion of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) poses potentially serious risks to the stability of coastal wetlands, an ecosystem that is extremely vulnerable to both biological and non-biological threats. However, the effects and mechanisms of sulfur (S) in mediating the growth and expansion of S. alterniflora are poorly understood, particularly when sediments are contaminated with cadmium (Cd). A 6-month greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the mediating effect of S on Cd tolerance and growth of S. alterniflora. Treatments consisted of a factorial combination of three S rates (applied as Na2SO4; 0, 500, 1000 mg kg(-1) dry weight (DW), as S-0, S-500, and S-1000) and four Cd rates (applied as CdCl2; 0, 1, 2, 4 mg kg(-1) DW, as Cd-0, Cd-1, Cd-2, and Cd-4). Results showed that although the exogenous S supply obviously increased Cd accu-mulation in roots (up to 71.22 +/- 6.43 mg kg(-1) DW) due to the decrease of Fe concentration in iron plaque (down to 4.02 +/- 1.18 mg g(-1) DW), biomass reduction and oxidative stress in plant tissues were significantly alleviated. The addition of S significantly up-regulated the concentration of compounds related to Cd tolerance, including proline and glutathione. Therefore, the translocation of Cd was restricted, and plant growth was not impacted. The present study demonstrated that the exogenous sulfur supply could promote the growth of S. alterniflora and enhance its tolerance to Cd. Therefore, under the effects of S. alterniflora, the increased fluctuations of S pool caused by the release and deposition of S might further exacerbate S. alterniflora expansion in Cd contaminated coastal wetlands.

AB  - Humulus japonicus in communities of Miscanthus sacchariflorus and Phragmites australis can grow large enough to overtop other species in the Amsa-dong floodplain. Because of strong winds and the weight of Humulus, plants of M. sacchariflorus and P. australis fell in mid-August and were subject to decomposition under its dense shading. To assess the effects of H. japonicus on nutrient cycling in these communities, we collected fresh samples of M. sacchariflorus and P. australis in litterbags and decomposed them under H. japonicus for 9 months, beginning in August. Biomass and organic contents from M. sacchariflorus during this incubation period were 49-51% and 44-48%, whereas those of P. australis were 49-61% and 32-52%, respectively. Their annual k values were 1.61-1.74 and 1.46-3.54, respectively. Initial N concentrations in M. sacchariflorus and P. australis were 13 and 20 mg g(-1), while C:N ratios were 31 and 21, respectively. These results indicate that H. japonicus is responsible for the collapse of M. sacchariflorus and P. australis in August and also accelerates their nutrient cycling through rapid decomposition, thereby increasing nutrient circulation in floodplains.

AB  - The stable isotope compositions (C and N) of plants and animals of a marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora in the Delaware Estuary were determined. The study focused on the juvenile stage of the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the importance of marsh-derived diets in supporting growth during this stage. Laboratory growth experiments and field data indicated that early juvenile blue crabs living in the Delaware Bay habitat fed primarily on zooplankton, while marsh-dwelling crabs, which were enriched in C-13 relative to bay juveniles, utilized marsh-derived carbon for growth. In laboratory experiments, the degree to which juvenile blue crabs isotopically fractionated dietary nitrogen, as well as the growth rate, depended on the protein quality of the diet. The range of delta(13)C Of amino acids in laboratory-reared crabs and their diets was almost 20 parts per thousand, similar to the isotopic range of amino acids of other organisms. In laboratory studies, the delta(13)C of nonessential and essential amino acids in the diet were compared to those in juvenile crabs. Isotopic fractionation at the molecular level depended on diet quality and the crabs' physiological requirements. Comparison of whole-animal isotope data with individual amino acid C isotope measurements of wild juvenile blue crabs from the bay and marsh suggested a different source of total dietary carbon, yet a shared protein component, such as zooplankton.

AB  - The Anthropocene has been proposed as a new geo-stratigraphic epoch where humans have become a global factor affecting the ecosystems. Estuarine sediments constitute a biogeochemical reservoir where trace elements (TEs) from natural sources mix with a fraction generated by human activities. This study assessed the natural lithogenic imprint of TEs from uncontaminated sedimentary records to study anthropogenic changes. Sediment cores were sampled in the estuarine part of the low populated and low industrialized rias of Ares (A), Betanzos (B) and Cedeira (C), which are located in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula. Cores were dated by the Pb-210 method, covering up to the last century period. Sedimentation rates (in mm yr(-1)) were 3.4 +/- 0.6 (older than 1961) and 8.2 +/- 3.2 (younger than 1961) for core A, 0.9 +/- 0.2 (<1940) and 4.2 +/- 2.3 for core B, and 13.4 +/- 1.4 for core C. The background fluxes of TEs were in the ranges of (in g m(-2) yr(-1)) 50-560 for Al and Fe, 20-320 for POC and 8-100 for PS, and (in mg m(-2) yr(-1)) 20-120 for As, 0.2-2.0 for Cd, 7-110 for Co, 40-870 for Cr, 20-230 for Cu, 0.1-0.6 for Hg, 290-2800 for Mn, 4-24 for Mo, 20-410 for Ni, 20-150 for Pb, 60-800 for V and 70-700 for Zn. The three cores showed an anthropogenic influence since the mid-20th century. The detected human impact during the Anthropocene was due to the Eume River damming and As-Pontes lignite mining (the largest mine open pit in the Iberian Peninsula) in core A, by bridge/road constructions, vehicles emissions and river mouth urbanization in core B, and changes in land use in core C. Sediment accumulation rates increased 2.4 (core A) and 4.7 times (core B) while TEs fluxes increased 2.4 times in core A and between 3.6 and 5.1 times in core B. Pre-industrial sedimentary records showed the lithogenic differences of the drainage basins, mainly granitic watersheds for cores A and B and the prevalence of basic rocks of the Ortegal Geological Complex for core C. This explains the high concentrations and fluxes of Cr, Ni and V of core C. The different lithogenic imprints highlight the value of using local background references in contamination studies, such as those on the Anthropocene influence in estuaries, which occurred after the Spanish Civil War in the studied rias.

AB  - The spatio-temporal distribution of geochemical fractions of phosphorus and its bio-availability for Asia's largest brackish water lake has been carried out. One way ANOVA analysis revealed that both iron bound phosphorus (Fe-P) (p < 0.05, n = 360) and calcium bound phosphorus (Ca-P) (p < 0.05, n = 360) showed a significant variation on a spatio-temporal scale which may be attributed to pH and salinity of overlying water column. Pearson's correlation matrix revealed that sediment texture played a major role in the quantification of phosphorus species. The relationship between Ca-P and Ca was not established for the sediments of the lake Chilika, which suggested its authigenic origin. The concentration of bio-available phosphorus (BAP) in different sectors of the lake varied in the order of northern sector (45.64%) > central sector (42.22%) > outer channel (36.63%) > southern sector (29.27%) of total phosphorus (TP). This is supported by the fact that bioavailable P is comparatively higher in the freshwater zone than in the brackish water zone. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a good relationship between dissolved phosphate concentrations of water column with benthic population density. It showed that TP availability in the sediment of the lake is mostly bounded with Al, Fe and organic matter (OM). Positive association of total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and OM with negatively loading of Eh indicates towards the fact that, deposition of TN and TC is largely governed by OM availability in sediment.

AB  - Along the coastal fringe of the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta in southwestern Alaska, geese maintain grazing lawns dominated by a rhizomatous sedge that, when ungrazed, transitions to a taller, less palatable growth form that is taxonomically described as a different species. Nutrients recycled in goose feces, in conjunction with grazing, are critical to the rapid, nutritious growth of grazing lawns, and selective foraging on lawns has positive life-history consequences for goslings. To examine whether bidirectional vegetation shifts were accompanied by parallel changes in N cycling, we studied how N-15-urea and (CN)-C-13-N-15-glycine were processed through soils and plants of native and recently reverted vegetation states. Biomass and plant N-15 uptake from plots reverted to the tall growth form using exclosures and from those shifted to grazing lawns by experimental clipping and then goose grazing were identical to their native counterparts. Total recovery of N-15 within the tall vegetation types was significantly greater than within grazing lawns, although when expressed on a per-gram biomass basis, percentage of N-15 recovery was significantly higher in grazing lawns compared with the tall vegetation state. Patterns of C-13 enrichment in CO2 soil efflux showed rapid use of C-13-glycine as a respiratory substrate within the first hour following injection, with both the timing and magnitude of efflux occurring at similar time points for all four vegetation types. However, higher soil respiration rates and a shorter half-life for C-13-glycine in soils from tall meadows resulted in a greater proportional loss of (CO2)-C-13 compared with grazing lawns. Despite daily-to-weekly tidal inundation, all of N-15 from labeled substrates could be accounted for within 1 m of the injection grid from soils of both states after 30 d, with significant levels of N-15 in soils and vegetation after one year. Geese have remarkably high fidelity to brood-rearing areas, returning as adults to the same grazing lawns where they were raised as goslings. Our data suggest that the role fecal-derived nutrients play in the positive feedback loop between geese and their food resources can provide a long-term legacy that spans generations.

AB  - Biogeochemical transformations in wetlands impact water quality, nutrient transport across landscapes, and greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. This study examined anaerobic microbial respiration and methanogenesis in surficial sediments of six wetlands lying on glacial terrain in southwest Michigan, USA. Three of the wetlands were mainly groundwater-fed and three were mainly precipitation-fed. Ambient rates of denitrification, sulfate reduction, iron reduction, methanogenesis, and acetate turnover were measured at each wetland. Ambient denitrification rates were not detectable in any wetland, but denitrifying enzyme activity, measured in two wetlands, indicated that the potential to remove nitrate was higher in a groundwater-fed wetland. Iron reduction was measurable mainly in precipitation-fed wetlands while sulfate reduction was only measurable in the groundwater-fed wetlands. Methanogenesis was measurable in all wetlands, with no differences between wetlands with contrasting water sources, indicating that methanogenesis is important regardless of water source. Acetate turnover rates, which reflect total anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis, were higher in the groundwater-fed wetlands and proportional to the sum of the individual carbon mineralization rates across all wetlands. Even though there was substantial variation in the process rates among these wetlands, the general patterns indicate that water source influences the biogeochemical function of wetlands.

AB  - Tidal freshwater marshes exist at the interface between watersheds and estuaries, and thus may serve as critical buffers protecting estuaries from anthropogenic metal pollution. Biweekly samples of newly deposited marsh sediments were collected and analyzed for Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations over 21 months from July 1995 to March 1997 in five distinct habitats at the head of Bush River, Maryland. Bi-weekly anthropogenic metal loading averaged over 1996 ranged from 6-306 and 25-1302 mug cm(-2) year(-1) between sites for Cu and Zn, respectively. Based on Fe-normalized trace metal signatures, Susquehanna River sediment does not significantly contribute to upper Bush River. Organic matter was found to dilute total metal concentrations, whereas past studies suggested organics enhance labile metal content. Analysis of metal input pathways shows that marsh metals are primarily imported from nearby subtidal accumulations of historic watershed material by tidal flushing.

AB  - This study examines the solubility relationships of metal sulfides in highly reduced soils. Soils obtained from a mountain bog previously contaminated with Fe, Zn, Cd, and Pb sulfide ores were subjected to oxidation followed by gradual but severe reduction. The sequence of metal sulfide precipitations that occur as pe + pH is lowered was predicted from thermodynamic calculations. These predictions were compared to the results obtained from two studies in which soil suspensions were equilibrated under controlled redox conditions. Oxidation of the surface horizon of these soils resulted in partial dissolution of existing metal sulfides as pH decreased. Subsequent reduction increased pH and formed reaction products that controlled the activities of Fe2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+. When decomposing organic matter was used as the electron source to reduce these soils. the solubility of these metals approached equilibrium with Fe3O4(amorp), ZnCO3(smithsonite), CdCO3(octavite), and PbCO3(cerrusite), respectively, as pH increased above 5.5 and pe + pH decreased to 7.7 at 65 d. The pe + pH did not go lower with organic matter as the sole reductant. A reducing gas mixture containing 1% H-2(g), 5% CO2(g), and 94% Ar was passed through identical soil suspensions to which organic matter had also been added to lower the pe + pH so metal sulfides could precipitate. The calculated pe + pH values at which the metal sulfides formed were: (1) CdS(greenockite) (4.85), (2) ZnS(sphalerite) (4.70), (3) PbS(galena) (4.40), and (4) FeS2(pyrite) (4.35). Since Fe is more abundant in most soils than SO42-, Cd, Zn, and Pb, FeS2(pyrite) is expected to control sulfide activity, and in turn, the activities of Cd2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+. Only under conditions in which there is an abundance of SO42- compared to Fe would the control by pyrite be negated.

AB  - Methane (CH4) exchange in wetlands is complex, involving nonlinear asynchronous processes across diverse time scales. These processes and time scales are poorly characterized at the whole-ecosystem level, yet are crucial for accurate representation of CH4 exchange in process models. We used a combination of wavelet analysis and information theory to analyze interactions between whole-ecosystem CH4 flux and biophysical drivers in two restored wetlands of Northern California from hourly to seasonal time scales, explicitly questioning assumptions of linear, synchronous, single-scale analysis. Although seasonal variability in CH4 exchange was dominantly and synchronously controlled by soil temperature, water table fluctuations, and plant activity were important synchronous and asynchronous controls at shorter time scales that propagated to the seasonal scale. Intermittent, subsurface water table decline promoted short-term pulses of methane emission but ultimately decreased seasonal CH4 emission through subsequent inhibition after rewetting. Methane efflux also shared information with evapotranspiration from hourly to multiday scales and the strength and timing of hourly and diel interactions suggested the strong importance of internal gas transport in regulating short-term emission. Traditional linear correlation analysis was generally capable of capturing the major diel and seasonal relationships, but mesoscale, asynchronous interactions and nonlinear, cross-scale effects were unresolved yet important for a deeper understanding of methane flux dynamics. We encourage wider use of these methods to aid interpretation and modeling of long-term continuous measurements of trace gas and energy exchange.

AB  - The long-term retention of nitrogen in sediment of a tidal freshwater marsh in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) was investigated by an in situ N-15-labeling experiment. Sediment of an unvegetated creek bank and sediment vegetated by common reed (Phragmites australis) were labeled with N-15-enriched NH4+ after which N-15 was traced into pore-water dissolved NH4+, NO3-, and N-2; plant roots and leaves; and bulk sediment over a 1-yr period. Label retention in the sediment organic matter was further characterized by analyzing KCl-extracted sediment and hydrolyzable amino acids (including the bacterial biomarker D-alanine). Within weeks all added (NH4+)-N-15 was transformed and/or assimilated by the biota. Between 42% and 48% of the added label was recovered in plants, root, and sediment (collectively) after 3-6 months, whereas 24% remained after 1 yr. Transfer to plants and roots was rapid and although retention in leaves was transient, the N-15 assimilated by roots was retained for the entire 1-yr period. Root assimilation could account for 12-23% of the N-15 retained in vegetated plots. The majority of N-15 was retained in the organic matter pool within the sediment (represented by N-15 in the KCl extracted sediment and total hydrolyzable amino acids), primarily through efficient recycling of the N-15 within the microbial community. N-15 incorporation into D-alanine confirmed that bacteria were the major group of microorganisms responsible for the strong retention of N-15. This study shows the strong potential of reed roots and especially bacteria to retain nitrogen in tidal freshwater sediment over longer periods of time.

AB  - This study examined the spatio-temporal variability in fish assemblage structure and composition following monthly sampling (August 2006 to July 2007). Three estuarine zones (upper, middle and lower) of the unvegetated intertidal and subtidal channel habitats located in the Marapanim Estuary were investigated. In each of these zones, salinity, organic matter and sediment types were measured to assess any correlation between habitat types and the fish fauna. A total of 41 496 fishes, belonging to 76 species and 29 families, was recorded. Recurring changes in both species composition and trophic structure were attributed to seasonal variations, while habitat type played a more permanent role in modifying the structure of fish assemblages. Zooplanktivores (e.g. Lycengraulis grossidens) and herbivores (e.g. Cetengraulis edentulus) used the intertidal habitat almost exclusively and were associated with salinity and substratum composition (gravel, silt and mud). In contrast, benthophages (e.g. Cathorops spixii) and benthophage-ichthyophages (e.g. Cynoscion leiarchus) were primarily associated with the subtidal habitat throughout the estuary and were highly related to the presence of sandy substrata. This study highlighted the intricate roles that local factors (such as habitat connectivity) may have on the distribution of fishes at the assemblage level. As such, incorporating habitat sharing or segregation between species should be viewed as essential for any comparisons of estuaries over large geographic scales, and in particular for conservation planning and management measures.

AB  - Spatial variation in salinity, pH, redox potential, and in the concentrations of dissolved Mn, Fe2+ and sulphides in pore water were investigated in a mangrove system in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Total organic C (TOC), S, Fe and Mn were analyzed in the solid phase, along with acid volatile sulphide (AVS), density of roots and percentage of sand. Five zones, situated along the length of a 180 in transect were considered in the study. Four of these were colonized by different species of vascular plants (Spartina, Laguncularia, Avicennia and Rhizophora) and were denominated soils; the other was not colonized by vegetation, and was denominated sediment. The results indicated important differences between the physicochemical conditions of the pore water in the vegetated zones and the sediment. In the former, two geochemical environments were identified, based on soil depths. The upper 20 cm contained the largest quantity of roots, and the conditions were oxic (Eh > 350 mV) or suboxic (Eh: 100-350 mV), acidic, and with high concentrations of Fe and Mn in the pore water. Below this depth, the soil became anoxic, the concentration of sulphides (HS-) increased significantly and the concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn decreased significantly. The total S and the AVS fraction increased with depth, while TOC concentrations decreased, indicating that the decreases in Fe and Mn were due to the precipitation of metal sulphides. However, clear differences among the vegetated zones were not observed. The sediment was always anoxic, but with low concentrations of sulphide in the interstitial water, and was neutral or slightly alkaline. As in the soils, the concentrations of sulphides and total S increased significantly with depth, indicating that the conditions favoured the synthesis and stability of metal sulphides.

AB  - Phragmites australis invasion is altering plant communities and therefore, soil properties have been changed significantly. This study compared the diversity among three communities in a wetland to assess the impact of invasion by Phragmites and the associated impact on soil properties. Three diversity indices, species richness (S), evenness (E) and Shanon-Weiner index (H) had significantly higher values in uninvaded plots compared to invaded in all the communities. Invaded plots had the lowest diversity, with H = 0 and Simpson's index (D) = 1, (i.e. they were monospecific). These results support the idea that a reduction in diversity can be expected in wetlands colonized by Phragmites. Phragmites invasion significantly increased soil moisture, EC, phenolics, organic carbon, dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass (C, N, P) with reduction of pH and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi spore density compared with uninvaded zones. In addition, the study of antifungal phytochemistry of Phragmites elucidated the decrease of the competitive abilities of native plant Melaleuca ericifolia by interfering with formation of mycorrhizal associations and biomass. Our results suggest that Phragmites invasion has caused significant ecological alterations in communities by demonstrating a combined effect to plant diversity and soil variables.

AB  - Mangrove forests are productive habitats and major potential exporters of organic matter and nutrients to adjacent habitats. Here we examine the extent to which mangrove carbon is transferred to adjacent intertidal food webs in the second largest mangrove-covered area in Africa, in Guinea-Bissau. Applying stable isotope analysis and mixing models, we made comparisons at two spatial scales: (1) a large scale, comparing intertidal flats with (mangrove sites) and without (control sites) adjacent mangrove forests regarding the carbon isotopic signature of macrozoobenthos and sediment organic matter (SOM), and the relative importance of potential primary food sources in sustaining macrozoobenthos, and (2) a fine scale, performing stable carbon isotope measurements along 200 m transects from the coastline out to open intertidal flats, to trace mangrove carbon in macrozoobenthos and in the SOM. We found no evidence that mangrove carbon sustains intertidal food webs, despite SOM being significantly more depleted in 13C in mangrove sites. Mangrove leaves had the lowest relative contribution to the diet of macrozoobenthos, while macroalgae, benthic microalgae and POM showed variable but overall relevant contributions. Yet, at a smaller scale, mangrove carbon was detectable in SOM and in most macrozoobenthos, being strongest within 50 m of the mangrove edge and quickly fading with increasing distance. Our results suggest that there is only a marginal input of mangrove carbon into the food webs of unvegetated intertidal flats. Still, this leaves open the possibility of mangrove forests acting as sources of dissolved inorganic carbon and processed nitrogen, which can be assimilated by the algae and subsequently fuel adjacent food webs.

AB  - Wetlands are valuable habitats that provide important social, economic, and ecological services such as flood control, water quality improvement, carbon sequestration, pollutant removal, and primary/secondary production export to terrestrial and aquatic food chains. There is disagreement about the need for mosquito control in wetlands and about the techniques utilized for mosquito abatement and their impacts upon wetlands ecosystems. Mosquito control in wetlands is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including many hard to quantify elements such as human perceptions, cultural predispositions, and political climate. In spite of considerable progress during the last decades, habitat protection and environmentally sound habitat management still remain inextricably tied to politics and economics. Furthermore, the connections are often complex, and occur at several levels, ranging from local businesses and politicians, to national governments and multinational institutions. Education is the key to lasting wetlands conservation. Integrated mosquito abatement strategies incorporate many approaches and practicable options, as described herein, and need to be well-defined, effective, and ecologically and economically sound for the wetland type and for the mosquito species of concern. The approach will certainly differ in response to disease outbreaks caused by mosquito-vectored pathogens versus quality of life issues caused by nuisance-biting mosquitoes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the ecological setting and context for mosquito control in wetlands, present pertinent information on wetlands mosquitoes, review the mosquito abatement options available for current wetlands managers and mosquito control professionals, and outline some necessary considerations when devising mosquito control strategies. Although the emphasis is on North American wetlands, most of the material is applicable to wetlands everywhere.

AB  - Food web studies often ignore details of temporal, spatial, and intrapopulation dietary variation in top-level consumers. In this study, intrapopulation dietary variation of a dominant carnivore, the Laughing Gull (Larus atricilla), was examined using carbon. nitrogen, and sulfur isotope analysis of gull tissues as well as their prey (fish, invertebrates, and insects) from the Virginia Coast Reserve estuarine system. As earlier traditional diet studies found evidence of individual dietary specialization within gull populations, this study used stable isotope analysis to assess specialization in a coastal Laughing Gull population. Specifically, blood, muscle, and feather isotope values indicated significant intrapopulation dietary specialization. Some gulls relied more heavily on estuarine prey (mean blood delta C-13 = - 17.5, delta N-15 = 12.6, and delta S-34 = 9.3), whereas others appeared to consume more foods of marine origin (mean blood delta C-13 = - 19.4, delta N-15 = 14.8 and delta S-34 = 10.4). It is important to account for such dietary variability when assessing trophic linkages in dynamic estuarine systems.

AB  - Sediment samples were collected in five marshes (C1, Phragmites australis marsh; C2, P. australis and Cyperus malaccensis marsh; C3, C. malaccensis marsh; C4, Spartina alterniflora marsh; and C5, Cyperus compressus marsh) respectively along two typical transects (T1 and T2) extending from the vegetated marsh to the mudflat in a typical subtropical estuary (Min River) of China in July 2015 to investigate the spatial variation and toxicity of heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Ni) in intertidal zone. Results showed that the concentrations of heavy metal in surface sediments of the two transects were in the order of Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Ni and slightly decreased from the land to the sea except for Pb and Zn. The levels of the five metals at C5 marsh were generally the lowest, while those of Pb, Cr, and Zn at C2 marsh were the highest. The vertical variations of Pb, Cr, and Zn concentrations in profiles differed among marshes or transects, and in most cases, there was no evidence of sediment organic matter (SOM) contributing to the sorption of significant amount of metals in sediments along the two transects, while grain composition was a primary factor controlling the spatial variations of metals. Both the vertical distributions of Cu and Ni levels among marshes or transects showed little fluctuation, which could be better explained by the effects of sulfur on the solubility and mobility of the two metals in profiles. Heavy metal levels in sediments of the Min River estuary were much higher compared with most estuaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America. The sediments in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary were moderately polluted by the five metals, and particularly, Ni was identified as heavy metal of primary concern. Both Ni and Pb in sediments of the intertidal zone showed high potential toxicity and high contributions to the sum of the toxic units (Sigma TUs). In future, the metal pollutions in intertidal zone of the Min River estuary might be more serious, and in the next step, there will be long-term potential consequences for endangered animals or migrant birds if measures are not taken to rehabilitate the sediments resulting from metal pollutions.

AB  - In floating soils, organic matter accumulation is the result of the imbalance between decomposition rate and macrophytes' production, and it can limit nutrient availability. In this study, we determined the percentage of litter that is added to the floating soil in one year and the nitrogen dynamics of Rhynchospora asperula (Nees) Steud (Cyperaceae), an abundant species in Esteros del Ibera, a South American wetland with extended areas of floating soils. According to the decomposition rate determined (k = 0.0032 day(-1)), the annual percentage of mass lost was 69%. Conditions of the floating soil were simulated in a 146-day field experiment. The results show that the decomposition rate was higher when the litter was in water contact, and the mass loss in the field sampling at the beginning of the decomposition was similar to that of the treatments that simulated this condition. The nitrogen concentration in the aboveground biomass was almost constant, and the results indicate that there was translocation from the senescent leaves, but not a preferential nitrogen translocation from the rhizomes and roots. During summer the maximum biomass and the low nitrogen concentration in the floating soil coincide, but the nitrogen intake by the aboveground biomass was only 4% of the total nitrogen content of the floating soil. Nitrogen concentration in the litter increased and, though immobilization cannot be ruled out, there was net mineralization. The nitrogen mineralized in the first decomposition year was 30% of the nitrogen added to aboveground biomass during the study period.

AB  - This study determines uptake and accumulation of radionuclides and heavy metals by Pluchea indica and Avicennia marina and evaluates phytoremediation potential via greenhouse and field experiments. P. indica and A. marina are considered excluders for K-40 and Ra-262, and Pb since roots accumulated them in higher quantities compared to other plant parts, and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and transfer factor (TF) values for Pb, and K-40 and Ra-262 were > 1, respectively. Absorbed, dose rate in air (D) showed significant values in sediments, which were generally over the maximum recommended value of 55 nGy h(-1). Phytostabilization of radionuclides and heavy metals may serve as an appropriate strategy for mangrove-polluted areas. D values in sediments were considered sufficiently high to recommend long-term monitoring. Radionuclide activities may increase in the food chain via uptake and accumulation of edible plants, ultimately resulting in harm to human health.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios are applied in many ways to explore the relationship between mangroves and fishes. Here I summarize information pertinent to three central questions regarding the mangrove-fishes link: Can stable isotope ratios be used to (1) identify basal resource pools that support fishes associated with mangrove habitat?, (2) reveal aspects of consumer trophic structure in mangrove fish communities?, and (3) describe fish movement patterns with respect to mangroves? I review recent research developments that pertain to each question, including a discussion of the limitations of stable isotope ratios in understanding the mangrove-fishes link. I emphasize promising avenues for future research, including labeled isotope tracer experiments, probabilistic and spatial analyses of potential basal resource pools, novel community-wide and intraspecific metrics, and utilization of differential tissue turnover rates within and among organisms. Stable isotope ratios alone provide numerous insights into the role of mangroves as fish habitat, but the most thorough understanding of the mangrove-fisheries link is likely to stem from integrative approaches that combine stable isotope ratio analyses and other methodologies into a broad research framework.

AB  - Water column dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the main creek of the Bangrong mangrove forest, Phuket Island, Thailand, were examined during the dry season. Water sampled from the upper and lower reaches of the creek throughout entire neap and spring tide periods was incubated under saturated irradiation and in the dark. The activity of microbial primary producers and heterotrophs were evaluated from changes in O-2, TCO2, DOC, DIN, DON and PO43- concentrations. Gross primary production was moderate (1.6-2.4 muM C h(-1)) with no pronounced spatial and temporal variations. A large fraction of the assimilated inorganic carbon and nitrogen was released in the form of DOC (50-90%) and DON (50-60%) indicating that primary producers were under stress or nutrient depleted. PO43- and occasionally DIN appeared to be the limiting nutrients. The pelagic heterotrophic community was supported by DOC (50-100%) and DON (40-90%) excreted by primary producers when exposed to light. However, rapid light attenuation in the turbid creek water rendered the entire water column strongly heterotrophic at all times (1.1-2.8 muM C h(-1)). The microbial heterotrophs are therefore largely supported by particulate and dissolved substrates derived from tidal resuspension, mangrove root exudates and leachates from fallen leaves on the forest floor. The relatively high concentrations of metabolites (e.g. CO2, NH4+) in creek water were primarily supplied by microbial mineralization. Water seeping from creek banks, which was only enriched in TCO2 (2 times) and PO43- (20-100 times) compared with creek water, is not considered an important source of solutes in the waterways of the Bangrong mangrove forest. Although the results obtained here are only strictly representative for the dry season, water column processes in the wet season are not expected to differ much due to the limited seasonal variations with respect to physical, chemical and biological parameters in the Bangrong area.

AB  - To reveal the dynamics of phosphate behavior in a calcareous paddy soil chronosequence (after 0, 3, 8, 30, and 70 yr of rice [Oryza sativa L.] cropping), P adsorption-desorption isotherms, chemical fractions, and loss risks were investigated. The contents of P adsorbents (i.e., Fe and Al oxides and Ca salts) in the paddy soils increased with cultivation age, mainly through accelerated primary mineral destruction and weathering in an Alfisol, along with a small portion from irrigation waters. The Langmuir equation gave increasing P adsorption capacities (Q(m)(ad)) of 520.67, 545.67, 662.78, 860.79, and 834.45 mg kg(-1) for 0, 3, 8, 30, and 70 yr. The Q m ad was closely correlated with free Fe and Al oxides, amorphous Al oxides, and HCl-replaceable Ca contents. The fraction of Ca-P was 52.04 to 63.64% without P inputs, indicating that Ca salts primarily determined P availability. The preferential forms of P retained by paddy soils were in the following order: Ca-P > Al-P > Fe-P > loosely sorbed P. The contents of Olsen-P in 3- and 8-yr paddy soils were 42.1 and 28.1 mg kg(-1), respectively, much higher than for the two older paddy soils and the upland soil (11.6-24.8 mg kg(-1)). The highest degree of P saturation and equilibrium P concentration were in the two younger paddy soils, indicating the increasing potential environmental risk of P loss in paddy soils in the first few years. Hence, more attention should be given to P loss in newly reclaimed paddy soils.

AB  - Precipitation of Ca phosphates negatively affects recovery by plants of P fertilizer applied to calcareous soils, but organic matter slows the precipitation of poorly soluble Ca phosphates. To study the effect of high molecular weight organic compounds on the recovery of applied P, a mixture of humic and fulvic acids was applied to calcareous soils with different levels of salinity and Na saturation which were fertilized with 200 and 2000 mg P kg(-1) as NH4H2PO4. Recovery was measured as the ratio of increment in Olsen P-to-applied P after 30, 60 and 150 days, and associated P forms were studied using sequential chemical fractionation and P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Application of the humic-fulvic acid mixture (HFA) increased the amount of applied P recovered as Olsen P in all the soils except in one soil with the highest Na saturation. In soils with high Ca saturation and high Olsen P, recovery increased from < 15% in the absence of amendment to > 40% at a 5 g HFA kg(-1) amendment rate (30 days incubation and 200 mg P kg 1 fertilizer rate). This is ascribed to inhibition of the precipitation of poorly soluble Ca phosphates, consistent with the sequential chemical extraction (reduction of the HCl extractable P) and P concentration in 0.01 M CaCl2 (1: 10 soil: solution ratio) extracts. P-31 NMR spectra revealed that in non-amended samples, most spectral shifts were due to poorly soluble P compounds (carbonate apatite); on the other hand, at the 5 gHFA kg(-1) rate, significant amounts of amorphous Ca phosphate and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCDP) were identified. The increase in the recovery of applied P due to HFA reveals a positive effect of the application of organic matter as soil amendments on the efficiency of P fertilizers and also explains that manures and other organic sources of P were more efficient increasing available P than inorganic P fertilizers in calcareous soils.

AB  - Recent climate observations suggest that extreme climatic events (ECE; droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, heat waves) have increased in frequency and/or intensity in certain world regions, consistent with climate model projections that account for man's influence on the global climate system. A synthesis of existing literature is presented and shows that ECE affect estuarine water quality by altering: (1) the delivery and processing of nutrients and organic matter, (2) physical-chemical properties of estuaries, and (3) ecosystem structure and function. From the standpoint of estuarine scientists and resource managers, a major scientific challenge will be to project the estuarine response to ECE that will co-occur with other important environmental changes (i.e., natural climate variability, global warming, sea level rise, eutrophication), as this will affect the provisioning of important ecosystem services provided by estuaries.

AB  - The snail, Littorania scabra, is a dominant grazer on tropical mangrove trees, and may play an important role in the food web dynamics of these ecosystems. Its daily vertical migration to avoid tidal submersion results in exposure to varying food types and abundances. A comprehensive diet analysis - gut contents, fatty acid profiles, and stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) - was conducted on snails migrating along mangrove trees and snails maintained in non-tidal mesocosms at Nananu-i-ra, Fiji Islands. In addition, fatty acid profiles and stable isotope signatures were obtained from surface scrapings of mangrove roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. Results from this multi-technique study indicate that L scabra is mainly a generalist herbivore, which easily shifts diets depending on food availability, and which also has the ability to ingest and assimilate zooplankton. Ingestion of greater quantities of diverse foods (i.e., microalgae, foliose/corticated macrophytes, filamentous algae, mangrove tissues, zooplankton) takes place in the bottom areas of mangrove trees (roots and trunks) during low tides, while top areas (branches and leaves) provide limited food resources for snails feeding during high tides. However, snails preferentially assimilate microalgae and bacteria, regardless of their feeding habitat (different areas within mangrove trees and non-tidal mesocosms). The daily vertical movements of this snail result in variable feeding times, ingestion of different food types and amounts, and different assimilations. These findings also suggest that organic matter derived from mangrove tissues may not be readily transferred to higher trophic levels through this grazing pathway. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   The spread of mangroves at many locations in temperate northern New Zealand provides a stark contrast to the well-documented trend in mangrove forest decline recorded through the tropics and subtropics. To explore this difference, improved understanding is needed of New Zealand's mangrove ecosystems and how they respond to anthropogenic disturbance. The effect of mangrove removal on the community ecology of mangrove stands and adjacent habitats was investigated within Mangawhai Estuary, northern New Zealand, between March 2004 and September 2006. The vegetation, benthic macrofauna, and sediments were sampled within habitats (marshgrass, mangrove stands, pneumatophore zones, sandflats, and channels) at a treatment site (mangroves removed) and two undisturbed sites, before and after mangrove-removal activities. Mature mangrove habitats had less total abundance and fewer taxa than all the other habitats sampled and were dominated by pulmonate snails (Amphibola crenata) and mud crabs (Helice crassa). Whereas faunal composition varied seasonally as a result of life-history dynamics, temporal changes could be attributed to mangrove-removal activities. Mangrove eradication was followed by immediate changes in the sediment from a muddy to sandier environment, which favoured an overall increase in the abundance of crabs, snails, and bivalves. However, unexpected topographic catchment reconfigurations in late 2005 may have caused a subsequent increase in the delivery of silt and organic content to the study area and an overall decrease in faunal density in March and September 2006. The study provides direct evidence of the effect of mangroves on sediment and benthic faunal characteristics and the importance of catchmentderived imports to estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - The carbon and sulfur cycles in coastal wetland sediments are intricately linked. We measured total organic carbon (TOC) and total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS) in sulfate-rich wetland sediments at middle and low elevation saltmarshs along the Yancheng coast, China. Results show that the average TOC concentrations (5.01 +/- 2.31 kg C/m(3)) associated with Spartina sediments in mid elevation sites is much higher than that seen in low elevation mudflats (0.65 +/- 0.25 kg C/m(3)). TRIS concentrations in Spartina sediments ranged from 21.7 +/- 11.2 mu mol.cm(-3) to 3.0 +/- 2.0 mu mol.cm(-3). Within the TRIS pool, elemental sulfur (ES) constituted the lowest fraction (3.6% to 31.4%) and chromium reduced sulfur (CRS) and acid volatile sulfur (AVS) fractions were higher particularly at coasts characterized by siltation, ranging from 29.9% to 62.2% and from 28% to 59%, respectively. AVS or CRS contents correlated positively with dissolved iron/SO42- and pH, while no clear relationship was present between the TRIS fractions and the abundance of sulfate reduction genes or between the TRIS fractions and TOC. Massive pyrite was the dominant authigenic pyrite present at all sites. Our results suggest that with sea level rise, prolonged inundation and rapid siltation would increase TRIS (especially AVS) and TOC accumulation concurrently while coastal erosion and strong waves would reduce both TOC and TRIS accumulation but increase the ES proportion due to exposure to aerobic conditions.

AB  - In an era of rapid coastal population expansion and habitat degradation, restoration is becoming an increasingly important strategy for combating coastal habitat loss and maintaining ecosystem services. In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11% in Asia, and 7% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were <5 years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. Altogether, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.

AB  - Total mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were analyzed in near surface sediments (0-2 cm) and biota (zooplankton, macro-invertebrates, finfish) collected from Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island/Massachusetts, USA) and adjacent embayments and tidal rivers. Spatial patterns in sediment contamination were governed by the high affinity of Hg for total organic carbon (TOC). Sediment MeHg and percent MeHg were also inversely related to summer bottom water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, presumably due to the increased activity of methylating bacteria. For biota, Hg accumulation was influenced by inter-specific habitat preferences and trophic structure, and sediments with high TOC and percent silt-clay composition limited mercury bioavailability. Moreover, hypoxic bottom water limited Hg bioaccumulation, which is possibly mediated by a reduction in biotic foraging, and thus, dietary uptake of mercury. Finally, most biota demonstrated a significant positive relationship between tissue and TOC-normalized sediment Hg, but relationships were much weaker or absent for sediment MeHg. These results have important implications for the utility of estuarine biota as subjects for mercury monitoring programs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated environmental impact of large-scale dyke on the sediment geochemistry, sulfate reduction rates (SRRs), sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and potential contribution of benthic nutrient flux (BNF) to primary production in the Yeongsan River estuary, Yellow Sea. The sediment near the dyke (YE1) with high organic carbon (C-org) content ( > 4%, dry wt.) was characterized by extremely high SOD (327 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and SRRs (91-140 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The sulfate reduction accounted for 73% of C-org oxidation, and was responsible for strikingly high concentrations of NH4+ (7.7 mM), PO43- (67 mu M) and HS- (487 mu M) in pore water. The BNF at YE1 accounted for approximately 200% of N and P required for primary production in the water column. The results present one of the most extreme cases that the construction of an artificial dyke may have profound impacts on the biogeochemical and ecological processes in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment Wetland Change Model (DIVA_WCM) comprises a dataset of contemporary global coastal wetland stocks (estimated at 756 x 10(3) km(2) (in 2011)), mapped to a one-dimensional global database, and a model of the macro-scale controls on wetland response to sea-level rise. Three key drivers of wetland response to sea-level rise are considered: 1) rate of sea-level rise relative to tidal range; 2) lateral accommodation space; and 3) sediment supply. The model is tuned by expert knowledge, parameterised with quantitative data where possible, and validated against mapping associated with two large-scale mangrove and saltmarsh vulnerability studies. It is applied across 12,148 coastal segments (mean length 85 km) to the year 2100. The model provides better-informed macro-scale projections of likely patterns of future coastal wetland losses across a range of sea-level rise scenarios and varying assumptions about the construction of coastal dikes to prevent sea flooding (as dikes limit lateral accommodation space and cause coastal squeeze). With 50 cm of sea-level rise by 2100, the model predicts a loss of 46-59% of global coastal wetland stocks. A global coastal wetland loss of 78% is estimated under high sea-level rise (110 cm by 2100) accompanied by maximum dike construction. The primary driver for high vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise is coastal squeeze, a consequence of long-term coastal protection strategies. Under low sea-level rise (29 cm by 2100) losses do not exceed ca. 50% of the total stock, even for the same adverse dike construction assumptions. The model results confirm that the widespread paradigm that wetlands subject to a micro-tidal regime are likely to be more vulnerable to loss than macro-tidal environments. Countering these potential losses will require both climate mitigation (a global response) to minimise sea-level rise and maximisation of accommodation space and sediment supply (a regional response) on low-lying coasts.

AB  - Ground- and surface water chemistry and stable isotope data from the coastal zone near Ravenna (Italy) have been examined to determine the geochemical conditions and processes that occur and their implications for fresh water availability in the various brackish/saline coastal environments. Fresh water in shallow coastal aquifers is often not enough to provide drinking water but it may sustain agriculture and natural environments such as pine forests, dunes and lagoons. The hydrochemistry and stable O and H isotopes of the ground and surface water near Ravenna were investigated in relation to these particular environments: rivers, drainage channels, lagoons, coastal dunes, paleo dunes, agricultural fields, and gravel pit lakes. Emphasis was put on the spatial distribution of ground water bodies with similar hydrochemistry. Most water samples are of the brackish to saline NaCl- type (NaCl concentration 300-20,000 mg/L) with a negative Base Exchange Index (BEX) that is indicative of cation-exchange reactions caused by water rock interactions during the infiltration of saline water in a fresh water aquifer. Calcium-dominated fresh water is found only in the rivers, in the irrigation and drainage channels, and in a few ground water samples. The analysis of stable isotopes and SO42-/Cl- and delta O-18/Cl- ratios shows that the major chemical and physical processes determining the salinity in the area are evaporation, mixing with saline water, cation exchange, oxidation of organic matter, migration and seepage of (hyper) saline water. The migration and upward seepage of (hyper) saline water driven by the hydraulic gradients induced by the drainage system causes the aquifer to become more saline over time. The areas where natural recharge occurs have always been small and this in combination with the Mediterranean climate results in very little natural recharge. Therefore, unless drastic changes to the hydraulic infrastructure are made, the coastal aquifer near Ravenna will become more saline and will threaten the ecology of current natural areas as well as the farmland.

AB  - Mangroves harbor mosquitoes capable of transmitting human pathogens; consequently, urban mangrove management must strike a balance between conservation and minimizing public health risks. Land use may play a key role in shaping the mosquito community within urban mangroves through either species spillover or altering the abundance of mosquitoes associated with the mangrove. In this study, we explore the impact of land use within 500 m of urban mangroves on the abundance and diversity of adult mosquito populations. Carbon dioxide baited traps were used to sample host-seeking female mosquitoes around nine mangrove forest sites along the Parramatta River, Sydney, Australia. Specimens were identified to species and for each site, mosquito species abundance, species richness and diversity were calculated and were analyzed in linear mixed effects models. We found that the percentage of residential land and bushland in the surrounding area had a negative effect on mosquito abundance and species richness. Conversely, the amount of mangrove had a significant positive effect on mosquito abundance, and the amount of industrial land had a significant positive effect on species richness. These results demonstrate the need for site-specific investigations of mosquito communities associated with specific habitat types and the importance of considering surrounding land use in moderating local mosquito communities. A greater understanding of local land use and its influence on mosquito habitats could add substantially to the predictive power of disease risk models and assist local authorities develop policies for urban development and wetland rehabilitation.

AB  - Marine mycelial decomposers (eumycotes, members of Kingdom Fungi, and oomycotes, zoosporic members of the Kingdom Protoctista) are highly adapted for capture of solid substrate by pervasion and digestion from within. Thus they exert their influence in areas of large input of litter of vascular plants, especially at some types of terrestrial/marine ecosystemic interfaces (ecotones). Unavailability of methods easily used by general microbial ecologists has hampered progress in the study of marine mycelial decomposers, and there are still pockets of difficulty in this regard (especially for oomycotes). Recently published or refined methods for measuring fungal mass and productivity have begun to allow us to realize the impacts of fungi in marine ecotones. For example, it is now clear that the older paradigm reflecting negligible contribution of microbial mass to litter nitrogen content is false for the standing-decay system of saltmarsh grasses - in these decay systems, fungal mass can account for virtually all of the nitrogen present at some point(s) in the standing-decay period. Another generally held belief about marine fungi has also been reversed - ascomycetes (Fungi) of a saltmarsh grass (smooth cordgrass) clearly do digest lignocellulose under natural-decay circumstances. Much more work is needed to clarify the situation, but at present it appears that major types of marine ecotones (e.g., saltmarshes and mangroves) differ sharply in the balance among major groups of decomposers (eumycotes, oomycotes, and bacteria) with regard to their utilization of vascular-plant litter. In saltmarshes, microbial production in standing grass litter is strongly dominated by fungi, and oomycotes do not show evidence of a substantial role in decomposition. In mangroves, submerged fallen leaves appear to support minor fungal occupancy, but ubiquitous and rapid occupancy by oomycotes (especially Halophytophthora vesicula). Many exciting areas of research are now more open than ever before to marine microbial ecologists interested in working with mycelial decomposers.

AB  - Organic matter accumulation, the net effect of plant production and decomposition, contributes to vertical soil accretion in coastal wetlands, thereby playing a key role in whether they keep pace with sea level rise. Any factor that affects decomposition may affect wetland accretion, including atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Higher CO2 can influence decomposition rates by altering plant tissue chemistry or by causing shifts in plant species composition or biomass partitioning. A combined greenhouse-field experiment examined how elevated CO2 affected plant tissue chemistry and subsequent decomposition of above- and belowground tissues of two common brackish marsh species, Schoenoplectus americanus (C-3) and Spartina patens (C-4). Both species were grown in monoculture and in mixture under ambient (350-385 mu L L-1) or elevated (ambient + 300 mu L L-1) atmospheric CO2 conditions, with all other growth conditions held constant, for one growing season. Above- and belowground tissues produced under these treatments were decomposed under ambient field conditions in a brackish marsh in the Mississippi River Delta, USA. Elevated CO2 significantly reduced nitrogen content of S. americanus, but not sufficiently to affect subsequent decomposition. Instead, long-term decomposition (percent mass remaining after 280 d) was controlled by species composition and tissue type. Shoots of S. patens had more mass remaining (41 +/- 2%) than those of S. americanus (12 +/- 2%). Belowground material decomposed more slowly than that placed aboveground (62 +/- 1% vs. 23 +/- 3% mass remaining), but rates belowground did not differ between species. Increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration will likely have a greater effect on overall decomposition in this brackish marsh community through shifts in species dominance or biomass allocation than through effects on tissue chemistry. Consequent changes in organic matter accumulation may alter marsh capacity to accommodate sea-level rise through vertical accretion. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We tested the importance of in situ microphytobenthos (MPB) and transported material (seagrass, seagrass epiphytic algae, mangroves, saltmarsh succulents and saltmarsh grass in adjacent habitats) as ultimate sources of carbon to fish caught over mudflats. We measured delta C-13 values of these 6 autotrophs and 22 fish species in the subtropical waters of Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. All fish delta C-13 values lay in the enriched half of the range for autotrophs. We modelled the distribution of feasible contributions of each autotroph to fishes, and then pooled the contributions for autotrophs with similar isotope values. Carbon from the suite of autotrophs having enriched isotope values (seagrass, epiphytes, saltmarsh grass) provided much of the carbon to fishes: 90-100% of carbon for 3 species, 70-90% for 13 species, and 50-70% for 5 species. For the one other species, the contribution of these autotrophs was lower (30-50%), and for this species the contribution of in situ MPB might be as much as about 50%. We could not, however, separate the MPB contribution from that of mangroves and saltmarsh succulents, which was also low for most species. Organic matter from seagrass meadows is clearly important at the base of food webs for fish on adjacent unvegetated mudflats. We are uncertain whether the apparent contribution of saltmarsh grass is real or a spurious result due to the similarity in isotope values of this autotroph and seagrass. This suite of fish caught over mudflats is supported by food webs relying predominantly on carbon from adjacent habitats and not in situ MPB.

AB  - Soil amendment by phosphogypsum (PG) application becomes of increasing importance in agriculture. This may lead, however, to soil, plant, and groundwater contamination with trace elements (TEs) inherently present in PG. Monitoring of selected TEs (Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd) distribution and mobility in a Mediterranean red soil profile has been performed in soil parcels applied with PG over a 16-month period. Concentrations were measured in soil and plant samples collected from various depth intervals at different points in time. TEs sequential extraction was performed on soil and PG samples. Results showed soil profile enrichment peaked 5 months after PG application for Cd, and 12 months for Pb, Zn, and Cu. Rainwater, pH, total organic carbon, and cationic exchange capacity were the main controlling factors in TEs accumulation in soils. Cd was transferred to a soil depth of about 20 cm. Zn exhibited mobility towards deeper layers. Pb and Cu were accumulated in around 20-55-cm-deep layers. PG increased the solubility of the studied TEs; PG-applied soils contained TEs bound to exchangeable and acid-soluble fractions in higher percentages than reference soil. Pb, Zn, and Cu were sorbed into mineral soil phases, while Cd was mainly found in the exchangeable (bio-available) form. The order of TEs decreasing mobility was Zn > Cd > Pb > Cu. Roots and leaves of existed plants, Cichorium intybus L., accumulated high concentrations of Cd (1-2.4 mg/kg), exceeding recommended tolerable levels, and thus signifying potential health threats through contaminated crops. It was therefore recommended that PG should be applied in carefully established, monitored, and controlled quantities to agricultural soils.

AB  - We measured the influence of landscape setting on estuarine food web connectivity in five macrotidal Pacific Northwest estuaries across a gradient of freshwater influence. We used stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta S-34) in combination with a Bayesian mixing model to trace primary producer contributions to suspension-and deposit-feeding bivalve consumers (Mytilus trossulus and Macoma nasuta) transplanted into three estuarine vegetation zones: emergent marsh, mudflat, and eelgrass. Eelgrass includes both Japanese eelgrass (Zostera japonica) and native eelgrass (Zostera marina). Fluvial discharge and consumer feeding mode strongly influenced the strength and spatial scale of observed food web linkages, while season played a secondary role. Mussels displayed strong cross-ecosystem connectivity in all estuaries, with decreasing marine influence in the more fluvial estuaries. Mussel diets indicated homogenization of detrital sources within the water column of each estuary. In contrast, the diets of benthic deposit-feeding clams indicated stronger compartmentalization in food web connectivity, especially in the largest river delta where clam diets were trophically disconnected from marsh sources of detritus. This suggests detritus deposition is patchy across space, and less homogenous than the suspended detritus pool. In addition to fluvial setting, other estuary-specific environmental drivers, such as marsh area or particle transport speed, influenced the degree of food web linkages across space and time, often accounting for unexpected patterns in food web connectivity. Transformations of the estuarine landscape that alter river hydrology or availability of detritus sources can thus potentially disrupt natural food web connectivity at the landscape scale, especially for sedentary organisms, which cannot track their food sources through space.

AB  - After many years of increasing nitrogen deposition, the deposition rates are now decreasing. A major question is whether this will result in the expected positive effects on plant species diversity. Long-term experiments that investigate the effects of decreasing deposition are not available. Model simulations may yield insight into the possible effects of decreasing nitrogen deposition on the vegetation. Therefore we developed the vegetation succession model SUMO which is closely linked to the soil model SMART2. In SUMO, the biomass development of five functional plant types is simulated as a function of nitrogen availability, light interception and management. The model simulates the change in biomass distribution over functional types during the succession from almost bare soil via grassland or heathland to various forest types. The model was validated on three sites in The Netherlands and one site in the UK. The aboveground biomass of two grassland vegetation types was well simulated, as well as the aboveground biomass of heathlands during succession of sod removal. Some of the stages of forest succession were simulated less well, but the calculated biomass in the older stages agreed with measured values. To explore the long-term effect of a decrease in nitrogen deposition, we applied the model to a heathland and a pine stand. In the heathland a major change was predicted as a result of decreasing nitrogen deposition in combination with turf stripping. The dominance of grasses changed into a dominance of dwarf shrubs, whereas at continuing high levels of nitrogen deposition grasses remained dominant. In contrast, the simulations indicated only very small effects of a decreasing N deposition in pine forests. This difference is due to the removal of excess nitrogen by management (turf stripping) in the heathland, whereas the more extensive management in the forest hardly removes any nitrogen from the system. The main conclusion from these examples is that a decrease of nitrogen deposition may retard succession, and consequently increase biodiversity in heathland but probably not in forest. The effects of declining N deposition depend on the amount of N that is removed from the system as a consequence of the various management regimes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cycling of Fe and S was investigated in sediments of Gerritsfles and Kliplo, two acidic shallow moorland pools in the Netherlands, in order to reveal the importance of pyrite as a pool of inorganic S. The porewater chemistry in both pool sediments is extremely dynamic as, e.g., Fe2+ concentrations may increase twentyfold within a time span of a month. Periodic oxidized conditions occur in the top several centimetres of the sediment. The redox status appeared to be a main factor in determining whether pyrite or a monosulfide, defined by the content of acid volatile sulfur (AVS), is formed. In Gerritsfles and Kliplo, pyrite was the most important iron sulfide phase; sedimentary FeS2-S/AVS-S molar ratios were 32 and 55, respectively. In other lakes, where stratification caused anaerobic conditions in the hypolimnion, FeS2/AVS ratios were < 1. Morphological investigation by light and scanning electron microscopy indicated that pyrite was present as single crystals and as framboids. The framboids, mainly associated with organic matter, were thought to form in microsites where they may form slowly. The presence of a single crystal morphology point to a rapid formation of pyrite.

AB  - To test whether deforestation of tropical forests alters coupling of watersheds, estuaries, and coastal waters, we measured nutrients in 8 watershed-estuarine systems on the Pacific coast of Panama where watershed forest cover ranged from 23 to 92%. Watersheds with greater forest cover discharged larger dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and higher N/P into estuary headwaters. As freshwater mixed with seawater down-estuary, within-estuary biogeochemical processes erased the imprint of watershed deforestation, increased ammonium, lowered nitrate concentrations, and otherwise altered down-estuary water column composition. As estuarine water left man grove estuaries, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, but not dissolved organic nitrogen, were exported to receiving near-shore waters. Mangrove estuaries in this region thus provide important ecological services, by uncoupling coastal waters from changes in terrestrial land covers, as well as by subsidizing adjoined receiving coastal waters by providing nutrients. The pattern of land-sea coupling and exports was disrupted during La Nina-influenced conditions. In one instance when La Nina conditions led to upwelling of deeper layers, high concentrations of marine-derived ammonium were inserted into estuaries. In another instance, La Nina-associated high rainfall diluted nutrient concentrations within estuaries and lowered salinity regionally, and the fresher upper layer impaired coastal upwelling. Regional rainfall has increased during the last decade. If La Nina rainfall continues to increase, disruptions of current land-estuary-sea couplings may become more frequent, with potentially significant changes in nutrient cycles and ecological services in these coupled ecosystems.

AB  - Effects of low PAR-containing diesel were studied in a 60-day microcosm experiment at PAH concentrations 130, 1300 and 13,000 mu g/kg sediment. Nutrient fluxes, potential nitrification and meiofaunal community composition were analysed at three time points. Changed Sigma NOx-fluxes indicated reduced sediment nitrification in Medium and High with time, in agreement with lowered potential nitrification rates in all treatments. Reduction in silicate and phosphate fluxes over time suggested severe effects on activity of meiofauna. Reduced activity increased the anoxic sediment layer, which could have contributed to the changed Sigma NOx-fluxes. There were significant differences in meiofaunal community composition after 30 and 60 days in Medium and High. Changes were due to increasing numbers of harpacticoids and the foraminiferan group Rotaliina, as well as decreasing numbers of Nematodes and the foraminiferan group Reophax. In spite of the low PAH-level, small additions of this diesel can still have pronounced effects on meiofaunal and bacterial communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system consisting of the ascidian Styela clava and the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus with microalgae was grown in a seawater mesocosm. Microbial populations in the water, sediment and shelters were monitored over time. The composition of the water microbial community in the IMTA system did not differ significantly from that of the traditional culture system without ascidians. Bacterial populations in the water, sediment and shelters were low in the traditional A. japonicus aquaculture system, and lower in the IMTA system. The number of Vibrios in the water, sediment and shelters in the IMTA system was significantly lower than in the traditional culture (p < 0.05), while the quantity of Bacillus was higher in the sediment and shelters. All of these results indicate that the IMTA system effectively inhibited the growth of harmful bacteria, an important positive function in the health of the culture. The bacterial diversity index in the water in the IMTA system was between those of the baited and non-baited traditional aquacultures and was slightly reduced in the shelters. Over time, the bacterial diversity index in the sediment gradually dropped, especially in summer and autumn, when it was significantly lower than in the traditional culture. In winter, the diversity index increased to some extent, approaching that of the traditional culture.

AB  - Microbial communities in the sediment and associated with the dominant type of standing dead plant were collected from the high marsh zones of 10 sites along the eastern coast of the United States from Maine to Florida. Microbial community composition was examined using T-RFLP, and bacterial and fungal abundance was determined microscopically. Within the sediment, community composition was strongly correlated with latitude, indicating that biogeographical factors are important determinants of sediment community composition, whereas abundance was positively and strongly correlated with sediment organic matter content. A strong biogeographical effect was observed for both bacterial and fungal abundance on standing dead plants, but there was no clear relationship between community composition and latitude. Microbial community composition was more similar among plants of the same type (i.e., related plant species) suggesting that plant type (i.e., substrate quality) is primarily responsible for the determining community composition on standing dead plants.

AB  - The anoxic hypersaline Tyro and Bannock Basins are among the most sulphidic bodies of water in the marine environment (H2S > 2 mM). We report the distribution of elemental sulphur, Acid Volatile Sulphur (AVS), organic polysulphides, humic sulphur (0.5 M NaOH extractable), and pyritic sulphur in the sediments from these basins. Pyritic sulphur appears to be the main phase of inorganic reduced sulphur (50-80% of the total sulphur pool) and is at the same level (about 250 mu moles per gram dry weight) in cores recovered from the two basins. Remarkably, humic sulphur has been found to account for 17-28% of the total sulphur pool in the Tyro Basin, and for 10-43% in the Bannock Basin. Sulphur isotope data show negative delta(34)S values for both pyritic sulphur (delta(34)S: -19 parts per thousand to -39 parts per thousand) and humic sulphur(delta(34)S: -15 parts per thousand to -30 parts per thousand). This indicates that both pyritic and humic sulphur originate from microbially produced H2S.
   Neither basin shows a significant correlation between pyritic sulphur and organic carbon, suggesting syngenetic pyrite formation. Additionally, the degree of pyritization in these sediments (DOP is 0.62) indicates that pyrite formation is limited by the reactivity of Fe. Humic sulphur correlates with the pyritic sulphur distribution and seems to be related with gelatinous pellicles (bacterial mats at the interface between oxic seawater and brine). Both pyritic and humic sulphur can be formed in the water column at the interface of oxic seawater and brine by a syngenetic pathway; about 5% of the pyrite is formed in the sediments by diagenetic processes. The presence of a bacterial mat and high H2S content in the brines favour such conditions. However, most of the humic sulphur inventory can be supported by diagenetic processes. Although these basins differ in their major element chemistry, their reduced sulphur species chemistry appears to be similar. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Plant invasion can affect nutrient cycling by changing the quantity and quality of litter entering the environment. To determine the effect of an alien species (Spartina alterniflora) invasion on the decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics of litter in the Min River estuary, three communities with differing levels of invasion, namely, a Cyperus malaccensis community (before invasion, BI stage), a S. alterniflora community (after invasion, AI stage), and a C. malaccensis-S. alterniflora community (during invasion, DI stage), were studied using the space-for-time substitution method. Results showed that the decomposition of C. malaccensis was 59.79% faster than that of S. alterniflora, which was mainly related to the great variations in the C/N and lignin. Compared with S. alterniflora, the N (nitrogen) and S (sulfur) concentrations of litter in C. malaccensis were significantly higher. The C, N, and S stocks increased as the C. malaccensis was being invaded or after complete invasion by S. alterniflora, which might be ascribed to the higher mass remaining in S. alterniflora. Compared with S. alterniflora in DI stage, the higher C/N and C/S ratios might explain the higher C, N, and S stocks in S. alterniflora in AI stage. In summary, the invasion of S. alterniflora reduces the decomposition rate and nutrient release of litter.

AB  - The bacterial oxidation of sulfur and methane is central to the biogeochemical processes in sediments such as the tropical mangrove sediments. However, there is a lacuna of information on the seasonal interactions including the influence of monsoons which is a major driver of seasonal change, on sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), their activity and the environmental variables. To understand these interactions, the analysis was carried out on sediment samples that were sampled monthly for a year from Chorao mangrove, Goa, southwest coast of India. SOB (3.8x10(5)CFU g(-1)) and MOB (0.90x10(5)CFU g(-1)) had maximum average abundance in the surface sediments in the post-monsoon and monsoon season, respectively. The mean sulfur-oxidation activity (SOA) of 2.63mMday(-1) and methane-oxidation activity (MOA) of 110.94mMday(-1) were highest in surface sediments during the post-monsoon season. Generally, the activity of SOB and MOB in surface sediments of post-monsoon was 2.2 times(x) and 2.8x respectively higher than that in the monsoon season. Among the environmental parameters analyzed, protein and sulfide concentrations significantly (p<0.001) influenced SOA and MOA, respectively. There was a significant difference in SOA (p<0.003) and MOA (p<0.036) in surface sediments between the monsoon and the post-monsoon season. During the monsoon season, when the system is a sink of terrestrial/anthropogenic material, the interrelationship of SOB with MOA (r=0.617, p<0.001) and SOB with SOA (r=0.489, p<0.05) aids in maintaining the homeostasis of the system.

AB  - A combination of mineralogical (SEM-EDS, EMPA) and geochemical (redox dynamics, selective extractions) approaches was applied to mining- and smelting-impacted sediments from Lake Uru Uru and from the Cala Cala Lagoon, a non-impacted reference site, in the Bolivian Altiplano. The purpose was to assess the factors controlling the post-depositional redistribution (mobilization/sequestration) of trace metals and metalloids. As expected, trace metals and metalloids are less reactive at the reference site than in Lake Uru Uru. In the latter, trace metals and metalloids are principally hosted by Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides, authigenic sulfides and silicate particulates. Post-depositional redistribution is ascribed to early diagenetic processes driven by organic matter (OM) mineralization, including dissolution of trace metal-bearing phases and precipitation of authigenic sulfide and carbonate phases. Seasonal climate variability exerts a strong influence on these processes. Evaporation of surface water during the dry season in the northern part of Lake Uru Uru promotes large redox front oscillations in the sediments and, therefore, transient redox conditions, likely leading to the weakening of anoxia in near-surface sediments and to a 'compressed' redox zonation compared to the southern part of the lake. Seasonal disappearance of the water column in the Northern Lake Uru Uru entails an alternation of: (i) low trace element mobility in the dry season due to elemental precipitation; and (ii) an increase of trace element mobility via diffusive transport during the wet season due to release from OM, Fe- and Mn-oxyhydroxides and carbonates upon mineralization, reductive dissolution and destabilization processes, respectively. Reoxidation of authigenic Fe-sulfides likely following the re-instalment of the water column above the sediment at the end of the dry season and prior to the return of anoxia probably favors transport of trace elements to the water column. As a consequence of this intricate web of redox- and climate-related processes, both northern and southern sediments of Lake Uru Uru are a source of dissolved trace elements, particularly As and Cd, for the overlying water column via diffusive transport. However, much of the diffused As and Cd is likely to be removed from the dissolved phase by the redox loop through Fe-oxyhydroxide precipitation. Finally, it is suggested that long term sequestration of trace metals and metalloids in the sediments could be controlled by inter-annual climate variability such as ENSO events.

AB  - The use of mineral magnetic concentration parameters (chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM) as a potential particle size proxy for soil samples collected from the Isle of Man (British Isles) is explored as an alternative means of normalizing particle size effects. Comparison of soil-related analytical data by correlation analyses between each magnetic parameter and individual particle size classes (i.e. sand, silt and clay), more discrete intervals within classes (e.g. rule sand or medium silt) and cumulative size fractions (e.g. clay + fine silt) are reported. Both chi(LF) and chi(ARM) parameters reveal significant (p <0.05; n = 46), but relatively weak (r(s) = 0.297 and 0.369), associations with clay content, while X-LF, chi(ARM) and SIRM parameters have no significant relationship with sand and silt content or any discrete or CLullUlatiVC size fractions. Contrary to earlier research Findings. this indicates that magnetic measurements are not always a suitable particle size proxy and it is only certain environments and/or specific settings that are appropriate for granulometric normalization by this technique. However, if future researchers working in other soil settings can identify a formal predictable relationship. the technique is known to offer it simple, reliable, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and non-destructive approach that Could lie a valuable particle size proxy for normalizing particle size effects in Soil contamination Studies.

AB  - Carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen stable isotope ratio techniques were used in 1989 and 1990 to evaluate the relative importance of algae and of mangrove detritus in the nutrition of two penaeid prawn species on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Mangrove detritus was found to contribute to the nutrition of juvenile Penaeus merguiensis de Man living within tidal creeks, but not to adult P. merguiensis and juvenile and adult Parapenaeopsis sculptilis (Heller) captured offshore. Results from radiotracer feeding studies, with refractory C-14 mangrove lignocellulose as the food source, indicated that juvenile P. merguiensis from tidal creeks assimilated mangrove carbon with an effciency of 13.4%. This did not differ significantly (P = 0.05) from the assimilation efficiencies of juvenile and adult P. sculptilis living offshore (10.0 and 10.9%, respectively); these values were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for adult P. merguiensis (2.1%). Thus, the differential contribution of mangrove material to the nutrition of prawns in the tidal creeks and offshore was not related to differences in the prawn's ability to utilize detritus. Instead, our analysis of C stable isotopes in sediments indicated that mangrove detritus was generally more abundant within the tidal creeks than offshore. Juvenile prawns in the tidal creeks may also utilize mangrove material indirectly by feeding on small detritivorous invertebrates. Stable isotope analyses suggest that benthic microalgae constitute the other major dietary component for prawns living in tidal creeks, Prawns offshore were utilizing mainly phytoplankton-based material.

AB  - Aims This study was conducted to answer the question of whether elevated CO2 and the presence or absence of inorganic nitrogen (NH4+) affect the uptake of different forms of organic nitrogen in two dominant saltmarsh species Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens. Methods S. americanus and S. patens were grown under elevated and ambient CO2 conditions and a series of hydroponic assays were conducted using dual labelled (CN)-C-13-N-15- glycine, glutamic acid and urea supplied in both the absence and presence of NH4+. Results Results show rates of glycine and urea uptake were lower under elevated CO2 conditions for both species. Ratios of C-13 and N-15 in S. patens roots showed that at least 68 and 79% of glycine under ambient and elevated CO2, respectively, was taken up intact. Provision of NH4+ with organic N caused organic N uptake rates to decline by up to 75% in S. americanus and up to 50% in S. patens compared with plants that only received organic N. Conclusions The reduction in organic N uptake in the presence of NH4+ suggests that plants rely primarily on mineral N in the field. In addition, we can deduce that organic N uptake is not likely to supply plants with the additional N required under elevated CO2, and that the repressive effects of elevated CO2 on organic N uptake may have negative consequences for ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.

AB  - The attraction of female tabanids to Malaise traps and canopy traps baited with aged horse urine, 1-octen-3-ol, or a combination of aged horse urine and acetone was studied in the Kopacki rit Nature Park in Eastern Croatia. Malaise traps captured very few tabanids relative to canopy traps. The number of females of Tabanus tergestinus and Haematopola pluvialis collected from 1-octen-3-ol baited canopy traps differed significantly from traps baited with aged horse urine. However, the number of females of Tabanus bromius, Atylotus loewianus, and Tabanus maculicornis collected from canopy traps baited with 1-octen-3-ol and aged horse urine did not differ significantly. Canopy traps baited with aged horse urine collected significantly more Tabanus sudeticus than did traps baited with 1-octen-3-ol. Canopy traps baited with 1-octen-3-ol collected eight times more tabanids than unbaited traps, whereas canopy traps baited with aged horse urine and a combination of aged horse urine and acetone collected seven and four times as many tabanids, respectively, as did unbaited traps. It appears that 1-octen-3-ol and aged horse urine are very effective attractants for tabanids in this part of Europe. Tabanus bromius was the most abundant species with 53.14% in the sample collected by canopy traps.

AB  - The Australian continent spans coastal wetland settings ranging from extensive mangrove forest and sabkha plains occupying in the tropical north, to the southern half of the continent, where high wave energy constrains wetlands within numerous barrier-fronted estuaries, drowned river valleys and coastal embayments. Only on the island of Tasmania are mangroves absent; elsewhere mangroves, Casuarina, Melaleuca and saltmarsh interact in ways illustrative of the effects of ongoing climate, tidal and sea-level change. Observations over several decades have suggested that recent anthropogenic climate change may already be impacting Australian coastal wetlands in important ways. A period of accelerating sea-level rise has been associated with saline intrusion, mangrove encroachment and Melaleuca dieback in the tropical north, punctuated by widespread mangrove mortality in drought periods. The consistent trend of mangrove encroachment and replacement of saltmarsh in the south, is associated with an "accretion deficit" in saltmarsh during contemporary sea-level rise. We review the ecological and cultural implications of these changes, including impacts on habitat provision for migratory birds, fisheries values, carbon sequestration and Indigenous cultural values. Current legislative and policy protections may not be sufficient to meet the increasingly dynamic impacts of climate change in altering wetland boundaries, composition and function.

AB  - The chemical environment was measured in vertical and horizontal profiles of cores taken from intertidal sediments that are extensively burrowed by the mud crab Helice crassa. The crab burrows folded the thin (2-5 mm) oxic layer into the sediment, and the burrows appeared to have a strong influence on the concentrations of acid volatile sulfide (AVS), acid-extractable Fe-II (probably FeCO3 and FeS), Fe-III (probably predominantly hydrous ferric oxide FeOOH), and Mn-II,Mn-III,Mn-IV and a modest effect on FeS2 but no effect on total organic carbon, total organic nitrogen, or acid-extractable zinc concentrations. The oxic layer was thinner in the burrows than on the sediment surface and showed some minor differences in solid-state chemistry, with higher FeOOH and lower FeS2 concentrations in the burrow walls. Acid volatile sulfide, FeCO3, and FeS2 were found in the oxic layers, presumably because of deposits from crab excavations of deeper anoxic sediments. The chemistry of the bioturbated profile was highly variable, not only because of existing burrows but also because of infilled abandoned burrows. The colors of the sediment profile were strongly related to the concentrations of Fe-II, AVS, Fe-III, Mn, and FeS2. The implications of the observed sediment chemistry to the fate and bioavailability of contaminants is discussed.

AB  - The application of nanoscale zero-valent iron particles (nZVI) for the remediation of contaminated sites is very promising. However, information concerning the ecotoxicity of nZVI on soil microbial communities and, hence, soil quality, is still scarce. We carried out a three-month experiment to evaluate the impact of the application of different concentrations of nZVI (from 1 to 20 mg g DW soil(-1)) on soil microbial properties in a clay-loam versus a sandy-loam soil. Data on microbial biomass (total bacteria and fungi by qPCR, microbial biomass carbon), activity (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase and urease activities), and functional (Biolog Ecoplates") and structural (ARISA, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) diversity evidenced that the sandy-loam soil was more vulnerable to the presence of nZVI than the clay-loam soil. In the sandy-loam soil, arylsulphatase activity and bacterial abundance, richness and diversity were susceptible to the presence of nZVI. The high content of clay and organic matter present in the clay-loam soil may explain the observed negligible effects of nZVI on soil microbial properties. It was concluded that the impact of nZVI on soil microbial communities and, hence, soil quality, is soil dependent.

AB  - The construction and operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the largest hydropower dam in the world, has had significant consequences for the hydrology of riparian zones along the Yangtze river. Little is known about how such changes in hydrology might affect the levels of nutrients and organic matter (OM) in riparian soils. We conducted a nine-year study on the spatio-temporal dynamics and dominant environmental correlates of nutrients and OM in riparian soils along a 600 km section of the Yangtze. These soils have been exposed to a disrupted hydrological regime since the TGR's establishment in 2008. Vegetation surveys were also conducted from 2012 to 2016 to assess relationships between soil chemical properties and vegetation community properties under altered hydrology. Across the stream gradient, concentrations of total potassium (K) increased by 54% since the TGR's establishment. The opposite occurred for SOM and available K, concentrations of which were 35% and 33% lower in 2016, respectively, than those of 2008. The rate of increase in total K tended to be more rapid at the middle section of the stream gradient. Moreover, concentrations of SOM, total N, total K, and available phosphorus (P) and K tended to be particularly high at the middle section. The spatio-temporal distributions of nutrients were strongly positively related to the contents of fine soil particles (i.e., silt and clay). Moreover, the aboveground biomass was negatively correlated with the nutrient dynamics. Our results indicate that the control of the nutrient release in the middle reaches and lower elevations where fine particles tend to accumulate, will be essential for maintaining the health of aquatic and riparian ecosystems upstream of the TGR.

AB  - The concentrations of methanethiol (MSH) and 3-mercaptopropionate (3-MPA) increased for a period of up to 24 h in fresh slurries of anoxic Biscayne Bay sediments.  Other endogenous thiols such as glutathione (GSH) decreased immediately after slurry preparation or were not detectable at all.  The maximum concentrations reached by 3-MPA and MSH were sometimes as high as 1-mu-M, but were usually in the 100 to 300 nM range.  After the initial increases, the concentrations of these thiols decreased rapidly to nearly constant levels of approximately 20 nM for MSH and < 1nM for 3-MPA.  In pre-incubated slurries, which had constant levels of thiols, the addition of microbial inhibitors including tungstate, molybdate, chloroform, and a mixture of chloramphenicol plus tetracycline caused MSH and 3-MPA to accumulate steadily.  In the presence of inhibitors, accumulation rates of MSH ranged from 18 to 730 nM.d-1 and those of 3-MPA ranged from 0 to 185 nM.d-1.  Tungstate and chloroform generally gave the highest accumulation rates, while molybdate gave the lowest, possibly due to its complexation with sulfhydryl compounds.  BES (2-Bromoethanesulfonate) was also tested for its effects, but no 3-MPA and only trace amounts (19 nM.d-1) of MSH accumulated with this treatment.  However, additions of BES (10 mM) to sulfidic sediments caused significant (approximately 8-mu-M.d-1) production of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM).  Formation of HS-CoM was abiotic and was due to sulfide attack on the bromine atom in BES.  The accumulations of 3-MPA and MSH in the presence of several different microbial inhibitors, suggests that these thiols may turn over in anoxic sediments.  The relatively low concentrations of thiols observed in pore water profiles may be due to continuous microbial removal of these compounds.  Much larger amounts of thiols were associated with sediment particles than present in the pore water.  Evidence is presented which suggests that bound thiols may be exchangeable with the porewater, and therefore potentially available for microbial consumption.

AB  - We determined the geochemical characteristics of sediments and measured rates of the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulfate reduction (SR) in samples collected near thermogenic (structure II) gas hydrate mounds and in areas lacking hydrates along the continental slope in the Gulf of Mexico. We used radiotracer (C-14 and S-35) techniques to determine rates of AOM and SR over depth in sediment cores. Abundant mats of white and orange Beggiatoa spp. were common in areas of active seepage and these sediments were enriched in hydrogen sulfide and methane. In cores collected from areas without Beggiatoa or hydrate, concentrations of redox metabolites showed little variation over depth and these sites were inferred to be areas of low seepage. Integrated AOM rates were low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<0.05 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 2.8 +/- 4.6 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in seep cores that contained Beggiatoa or gas hydrate. Integrated SR rates were also low in Beggiatoa-free cores (<1 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) and averaged 54 +/- 94 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in cores with Beggiatoa or hydrate. Rates of SR generally exceeded rates of AOM and the two processes were loosely coupled, suggesting that the majority of SR at Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon seep sites is likely fueled by the oxidation of other organic matter, possibly other hydrocarbons and oil, rather than by AOM.

AB  - The invasion of Spartina alterniflora has a significant influence on soil biogeochemistry cycling in coastal wetlands. However, the roles of the S. alterniflora invasion chronosequence in regulating soil dissimilatory NO3 (-) reduction processes (denitrification (DNF), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANA) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)) remains unclear. The objective of this study was therefore to reveal the effects of S. alterniflora invasion on the soil NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance.
   We investigated plant biomass, soil properties, NO3 (-) reduction processes and associated gene abundance of NO3 (-) reduction pathways following S. alterniflora invasion chronosequences of 6, 10, and 14 years compared to Cyperus malaccensis in a coastal wetland of southeastern China.
   The S. alterniflora invasion generally increased plant biomass, soil water content, available substrates, nirS, anammox bacterial 16S rRNA and nrfA gene abundance, but it decreased soil bulk density. Soil DNF, ANA and DNRA rates in stands of S. alterniflora ranged from 1.52 to 17.58, 0.31 to 1.27 and 0.14 to 2.01 nmol N g(-1) h(-1), respectively, which were generally higher than the values in stands of C. malaccensis. The soil NO3 (-) reduction rates generally increased with the increasing chronosequence of invasion by S. alterniflora, while the changes in DNF and ANA rates were less pronounced than changes in DNRA. DNF was the dominant pathway (70.00-92.41%), and the ANA and DNRA contributed 2.49-15.27% and 5.10-20.75% to the total NO3 (-) reduction, respectively. The contributions of DNF and ANA to the total NO3 (-) reduction decreased slightly, while the contribution of DNRA increased remarkably after S. alterniflora invasion. Soil NO3 (-) reduction processes were influenced by available substrates and associated microbial activities. It is estimated that an N loss of approximately 520.97 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in C. malaccensis and 794.46 g N m(-2) yr.(-1) in S. alterniflora were linked to both DNF and ANA processes.
   The S. alterniflora invasion altered soil NO3 (-) reduction processes by increasing soil microbial activities and available substrates and thus may further mediate the soil N availability in the coastal wetlands.

AB  - Peptides and proteins are key compounds involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling in biological systems, but little is known about how chemical structure affects hydrolysis rates of these labile compounds in aquatic environments. To investigate effects of chemical structure, custom designed peptides were incubated in waters collected along a salinity transect from the James River, VA, to the coastal Atlantic Ocean. We synthesized tetrapeptide alanine-valine-phenylalanine-alanine (AVFA), a fragment of the common protein ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), and its related tri- and dipeptide subunits. We also synthesized a self-designed tetrapeptide serine-tryptophan-glycine-alanine (SWGA). Along the James River-ocean transect, concentrations of added tetrapeptides generally had a 1-2 d lag time before rapidly decreasing, suggesting that microbes needed time to adapt to the pulse of peptide added, being limited by either specific extracellular enzymes or membrane transporters. The hydrolysis rate of SWGA varied significantly along the transect, whereas that of AVFA did not, showing that microbes in different aquatic environments, or their extracellular enzymes, are selective for the peptides they use. Modification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid of AVFA to the a-carboxyamide inhibited its hydrolysis, particularly in relatively oligotrophic marine waters. This suggests that carboxypeptidases are less effective in hydrolyzing peptide amides even though it is apparent that they readily hydrolyze the corresponding peptide acids. This is likely an important process for preservation of peptides existing as amides. Comparison of hydrolysis rates of positionally rearranged tetrapeptides, AVFA, AAVF and AFVA, showed that the sequence of amino acids in a short peptide has little effect on tetrapeptide lability. Modification of SWGA by galactosylation demonstrated that the glycosylation does not confer resistance to short peptides from microbial degradation. Overall, this study shows how structural modifications can influence hydrolysis of short peptides, thus pointing to the need for further research on controls on peptide hydrolysis in the environment.

AB  - Rain falling at or near low tide is capable of eroding and transporting cohesive sediment from intertidal areas. Given that metals adsorb strongly to silt- and clay-sized particles, it is conceivable that low-tide rainfall may also liberate previously-deposited metals from storage in intertidal sediment. To investigate the potential for rainfall as an agent of remobilization, this study tested the hypothesis that suspended sediment in a tidal creek during low tide rainfall events contains different suites of adsorbed metals than during wind-only events and fair weather days. Water samples were collected during low-tide rain events in winter and wind resuspension events in summer. The concentrations of suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and the total adsorbed concentration (g L-1) of most metals were higher for a low-tide rainfall event than during wind-only and fair-weather conditions. Metal contents (g g(-1)) were also greater during the rain event for most metals. Principal components analysis and relationships between metal content and suspended sediment concentration suggest that rainfall during low tide can mobilize a different source of sediment than wind-wave resuspension and regular tidal action. The metal content of bulk sediment samples from around the study area could not be matched satisfactorily to the suspended sediment in any of the events. This implies that bulk sediment composition should not be used to extrapolate to suspended sediment composition in terms of adsorbed metal content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dual stable isotope analyses (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) Of fiddler crabs from a forest-fringed, land-loci;ed lagoon in Puerto Rico indicated the differential assimilation of material from ingested sediments. Fiddler crabs preferentially selected for nitrogen-fixing benthic microalgae (cyanobacteria) over vascular plant detritus. These results question the assumption that mangrove detritus is always the principal source of energy to estuarine consumers. Previous research from this lagoon as well as from Amazonia suggests that the magnitude of land-water ecotonal coupling may be low for these particular tropical systems where benthic algal productivity is presumably high.

AB  - Estuarine food webs are highly variable and complex, making identification of their trophic pathways difficult. Energy for the food web of the San Francisco Estuary is thought to be based largely on in situ phytoplankton production, but little attention has been paid to littoral habitats, where other energy sources may be important. We analyzed the stomach contents of over 960 juvenile fishes and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of these fishes and their potential food resources in pelagic and littoral habitats from the tidal freshwater area of the estuary. The mixing model IsoSource was used to examine energy sources important to consumers. Our results show evidence of two predominant food web pathways. Pelagic fishes and some littoral fishes showed strong dependence on a zooplankton-phytoplankton trophic pathway. However, the majority of fishes in littoral habitats had diets and carbon isotope ratios consistent with energy arising from submerged aquatic vegetation and epiphytic macroalgae. IsoSource revealed that the overall majority of nutrition of littoral fishes originated from consumption of grazer amphipods. Examining both stable isotopes and stomach contents allowed us to identify a food web with contributions to resident fishes that had been previously underestimated in the estuary. This study provides insight to how estuarine food webs have changed over the last few decades and highlights why the functions of habitats must be understood for effective restoration planning.

AB  - Mangrove forests are important coastal wetlands in most of the tropics, but their importance to fisheries is poorly understood. Rationales for conserving these ecosystems are partly based on ideas that mangroves are important to food webs that support fisheries. Here we review use of stable isotopes to test the strength of the mangrove forest-fish connection, suggesting that a dual focus on both food web ecology and habitat use may be most profitable in future studies of this type.

AB  - Artificial sediment enhancement using a thin layer of dredged material has been suggested as a means to increase elevation and create soil conditions conducive to increased marsh structure and function in deteriorating marshes. Using a chronosequence approach, we examined the effects of sediment enhancement in deteriorating marsh and open-water pond habitats located in six brackish marshes. Sediment enhancement of both marsh and interior pond sites had significant, immediate, and long-lasting effects on physical soil properties and nutrient status with increased bulk density and inorganic nitrogen. Vegetative cover and productivity response were minimal for deteriorating vegetated marshes with the short-term response data showing no significant impact of sediment enhancement and long-term trends indicating decreasing productivity over time. In contrast, trajectory models of vegetative cover and productivity in interior pond sites showed increases over time indicating that, for restoration of interior ponds, sediment enhancement may prove valuable. The use of trajectory models emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring to determine restoration success of projects.

AB  - This study relates the abundance of foraminifera with the fluctuations in hydrobiological characteristics generated by the monsoonal cycle in a tropical mangrove ecosystem. Monthly variation of physicochemical properties of water and sediment, phytoplankton production, foraminiferal assemblages were measured in the littoral zone of the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Intra-annual variation of foraminifera exhibited a maximum abundance during the post-monsoon period and out of the 25 genera, numbers of calcareous and agglutinated forms were 16 and 9, respectively. Live benthic foraminifera were found to inhabit a wide range of sediment depths and inhabiting a high energy environment their abundance was not restricted to the uppermost centimeter. Owing to mechanical damage (due to high energy system), chemical dissolution and intense bioturbation, the taphonomic processes in this mangrove swamp could result in the destruction of the small size fraction of foraminifera, including agglutinated tests. The low numbers of agglutinated foram could be due to silty clay substrate. Abundance of more calcareous dead specimens over live ones could be attributed to predation and transportation of dead marine species. Most of the marine species could not survive in this freshwater dominated system. Anthropogenic nutrient input and diatom bloom in association with enhanced food to benthos are important controlling factors on foraminiferal abundance and composition.

AB  - Seagrasses are indicators of ecosystem state because they are sensitive to variations in water composition and clarity resulting from watershed-level impacts. A simulation model designed to study Zostera marina (eelgrass) habitat dynamics in a variable littoral zone environment was used to address the potential ecological responses to eutrophication in lower Chesapeake Bay. The adjacent channel boundary environment is a source of dissolved and particulate materials to the littoral zone. In the simulations, concentrations of key water quality variables in the adjacent estuarine channel boundary were either halved or doubled relative to the base case to investigate light versus nitrogen effects. The role of the seagrass meadow in littoral zone carbon and nitrogen dynamics was evaluated when meadow size was changed in the model. Particulate and dissolved organic carbon accounted for 83% of the submarine light attenuation in the seagrass meadow In all model runs, the water column concentrations of chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were below the habitat criteria proposed as critical to seagrass survival. Eelgrass community production was carefully regulated by the interactive effects of light, nitrogen, and grazing on epiphyte growth. Increased eelgrass coverage in the littoral zone led to a simulated doubling of ecosystem primary production but reduced the fraction of production by planktonic and sediment microalgae. The simulation model presented here demonstrated the importance of material input from the channel in littoral zone biogeochemical dynamics. Submarine light regulated primary production more strongly than inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the model. External DIN concentrations influenced seagrass survival indirectly: enrichment stimulated growth of epiphytes and phytoplankton and promoted shading of the seagrass leaf. The model was based upon a unimpacted ecosystem and deteriorated water quality negatively influenced primary production greater than the increases triggered by improved conditions. Increased material loading to the littoral zone reduced submarine light availability, increased phytoplankton production, lowered ecosystem production, and reduced subtidal vegetated habitat. This simulation model of the estuarine littoral zone model combines hydrodynamics, biogeochemical sources and sinks, and living resources in order to better understand structure, function, and change in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - P>1. Positive interactions driven by ecosystem engineers have been determined to be important community forces in stressed environments. By ameliorating habitat conditions, ecosystem engineering can create available ecological niches for other species. In poorly oxygenated sediments of freshwater wetlands, small invertebrates such as tubificid worms and chironomid larvae are known to function as active bioturbators; however, their effects on the growth and physiology of organisms which are constrained by low oxygenation of sediments have never been studied.
   2. We examined whether the common bioturbator, Tubifex tubifex, significantly influences the growth and the physiological state of two plant species, Elodea canadensis and Myriophyllum spicatum, in experimental systems simulating a water-sediment interface of wetlands. We also quantified the influence of plant-animal interactions on biogeochemical processes (fluxes of oxygen and nitrogen at the water-sediment interface) and microbial compartment in sediments.
   3. Tubificid worms stimulated growth of aboveground and belowground biomasses of the two plants through reduction in the anoxic stress in sediments. Myriophyllum spicatum, which was the best adapted to sedimentary anaerobic conditions, essentially increased its biomass whereas E. canadensis, less adapted to anaerobic conditions, shifted its root metabolism from anaerobic to aerobic.
   4. Biogeochemical processes were not significantly influenced by plant-animal interactions: (i) oxygen flux from overlying water to sediments probably reached a threshold that could not be raised by the increased plant biomass induced by worms and (ii) nitrogen fluxes were essentially linked to bioturbation activities of worms.
   5. Our study confirmed that the reduction in constraining variables by physical habitat modifications (ecosystem engineering) may play a crucial role in community and ecosystem processes. The fact that positive interactions measured between ecosystem engineers and plant species in anoxic wetland sediments were highly dependent on the ecophysiology of plant species suggests an extension of this first study to a wide range of macrophytes in order to determine the main plant functional traits driving plant-animal interactions in wetland sediments.

AB  - The phylogenetic diversity and composition of the bacterial community in anaerobic sediments from Sapelo Island, GA, USA were examined using 16S rRNA gene libraries. The diversity of this community was comparable to that of soil, and 1,186 clones formed 817 OTUs at 99% sequence similarity. Chao1 estimators for the total richness were also high, at 3,290 OTUs at 99% sequence similarity. The program RDPquery was developed to assign clones to taxonomic groups based upon comparisons to the RDP database. While most clones could be assigned to describe phyla, fewer than 30% of the clones could be assigned to a described order. Similarly, nearly 25% of the clones were only distantly related (< 90% sequence similarity) to other environmental clones, illustrating the unique composition of this community. One quarter of the clones were related to one or more undescribed orders within the gamma-Proteobacteria. Other abundant groups included the delta-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria. While these phyla were abundant in other estuarine sediments, the specific members at Sapelo Island appeared to be different from those previously described in other locations, suggesting that great diversity exists between as well as within estuarine intertidal sediments. In spite of the large differences in pore water chemistry with season and depth, differences in the bacterial community were modest over the temporal and spatial scales examined and generally restricted to only certain taxa.

AB  - Aiming to uncover the effects of tidewater and crab burrowing on sulfur cycling of Spartina alterniflora marsh, a field experiment was carried out at Jiangsu Yancheng Wetland National Nature Reserve. H2S flux, plant sulfur storage and total sulfur of sediments in S. alterniflora marsh were measured under different tidewater and crab burrows treatments. Results showed that crab burrows significantly increased H2S emission from S. alterniflora marsh, while no significant effect on H2S emission by tidewater was detected. Both tidewater and crab burrows had no significant effects on plant sulfur storage except that the crab burrows significantly decreased it in the seeding season. Tidewater only significantly impacted total sulfur in sediments of 0-30 cm depth, while those in soil of 0-20 and 40-50 cm depths were significantly affected by crab burrows. Total sulfur in sediments affected by tidewater and crab burrows exhibited a seasonal variation. The findings of this study indicated that both tidewater and crab burrowing were key disturbing factors affecting sulfur cycling in S. alterniflora marsh but in different aspects.

AB  - The invasion of Spartina alterniflora Loisel, a perennial herb that was introduced into China in 1979, has become an important environmental problem in coastal zones of Jiangsu Province. Although microorganisms play an important role in the structure of ecosystems, the effect of S. alterniflora on soil microbial metabolic diversity remains unexplored. In this work, the variations produced by S. alterniflora in the seasonal dynamics of soil microbial metabolism were examined and compared with the soil microbial metabolism of bare flat. The obtained results indicated that S. alterniflora increases soil total carbon content during the whole year, and decreases soil salinity in spring, summer and winter. The presence of S. alterniflora enhanced the metabolic activity of soil microbes in summer. In autumn, Shannon (H') and Pielou (J) indices were significantly decreased in S. alterniflora-invaded soil. S. alterniflora altered microbial carbohydrate, amino acid, carboxylic acid, and phenolic acid metabolism in a season-dependent manner, and enhanced microbial amine metabolism during the four seasons. Redundancy analysis demonstrated that soil pH and salinity are driving the metabolic functional diversity in coastal wetlands. Taken together, these results confirmed that the invasion of S. alterniflora is modifying soil physicochemical properties and, subsequently, altering soil microbial metabolic diversity.

AB  - Ecological sites are a framework for documenting ecosystem conditions within a region but few have been developed for forested ecosystems. We developed ecological site concepts for southern New England glaciated forested upland and riparian benchmark soils with contrasting inherent properties. Within upland and riparian soils, we quantified the resistance or resilience of dynamic soil properties following specific management or disturbance. Although the upland soils had contrasting particle size classes, the vegetation composition, tree productivity, and soil organic C (SOC) pools were similar, suggesting that these soils have similar ecological potential. Coniferous and deciduous upland sites showed minimal differences. Selective harvest of 50% of overstory trees in the uplands decreased C addition from litter by 28% (p = 0.036) but did not significantly impact 0 horizon thickness or SOC contents, suggesting that C pools in these soils are resilient to selective harvesting. Although poorly and very poorly drained riparian soils had similar stands of Acer rubrum L., very poorly drained soils had larger SOC pools and thicker 0 horizons, and Carex stricta Lam. and Symplocarpus foetidus (L.) Salisb. ex W.P.C.Barton dominated the understory. These differences suggest these riparian soils should be considered separate ecological sites. Simulated N enrichment of riparian soils significantly (p = 0.006) increased root biomass but not CO2 respiration. Over time, N additions may increase C pools in riparian soils. Our studies suggest that ecological site concepts can be applied in southern New England forest ecosystems to establish a framework for understanding plant and soil responses to disturbance or management.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are the most productive ecosystem on Earth. The Northern Gulf Coast's saltmarshes, one of the largest wetlands in North America, are undergoing severe land loss at an alarming rate, mainly due to erosion and subsidence, among others. The erosional resistance of cohesive sediments in the saltmarshes determines the wetland stability and sustainability. In this study, a cohesive strength meter was employed in the field and laboratory to measure the critical shear stress in an oil-contaminated saltmarsh and a non-oily normal saltmarsh. In addition, the variation of critical shear stress along the depth was measured for both sites. Results indicate that various soil properties (e.g., water content, organic matter content, root content, pore water salinity, particle size distribution) integratively affect saltmarshes' erodibility. Yet, a clear understanding of the independent influence of these physical and geochemical properties on the erodibility of cohesive sediments requires further work. In general, a positive correlation exists between the critical shear stress and organic matter and root contents. The erosion threshold of the oil-contaminated sediment surface is less than that of the non-oily sediment, which may be attributed to the possibly reduced interparticle binding due to the residual crude oil retained within the pores of the cohesive sediments. However, an increase in the root contents below the ground surface in the oily sediments leads to better stability at depth than the non-oily sediments.

AB  - There are substantial riverine and sewage particulate inputs into Dublin Bay. The main river, the R. Liffey, accounts for almost 85% of the riverine input, which amounts to 37.1 t d(-1) of SPM. The sewage input, which is discharged into the estuary, is slightly less at 35. 3 t d(-1). The combined inputs deliver 17.4 t d(-1), 2.9 t d(-1) and 1. 2 t d(-1) of particulate C, N and P, respectively, to the Bay as a whole. Although the particulate N load accounts for just 20% of the total N input, the retention of particulates within the system, and the subsequent remobilisation of N from the sediments is heavily implicated in the macroalgal blooms. A particulate mass balance of SPM, and of C, N and P for the South Lagoon showed no consistent pattern of import/export except that the fluxes of the individual elements reflected SPM load and varied with quantity rather than quality. The molar C: N ratio was around 6: 1 although on occasion values approaching 3: 1 were obtained, indicating very high quality and potentially labile SPM. The controlling factors in the budget appeared to be the water velocities and to a lesser extent, the SPM load, which surprisingly was no greater on a spring tide than on a neap. In this shallow, and primarily intertidal, system, wind- or wave-driven resuspension may exert more influence than predictable factors such as tidal range.

AB  - The outwelling paradigm argues that mangrove and saltmarsh wetlands export much excess production to downstream marine systems. However, outwelling is difficult to quantify and currently 40-50% of fixed carbon is unaccounted for. Some carbon is thought outwelled through mobile fauna, including fish, which visit and feed on mangrove produce during tidal inundation or early life stages before moving offshore, yet this pathway for carbon outwelling has never been quantified. We studied faunal carbon outwelling in three arid mangroves, where sharp isotopic gradients across the boundary between mangroves and down-stream systems permitted spatial differentiation of source of carbon in animal tissue. Stable isotope analysis (C, N, S) revealed 22-56% of the tissue of tidally migrating fauna was mangrove derived. Estimated consumption rates showed that 1.4% (38 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) of annual mangrove litter production was directly consumed by migratory fauna, with <1% potentially exported. We predict that the amount of faunally-outwelled carbon is likely to be highly correlated with biomass of migratory fauna. While this may vary globally, the measured migratory fauna biomass in these arid mangroves was within the range of observations for mangroves across diverse biogeographic ranges and environmental settings. Hence, this study provides a generalized prediction of the relatively weak contribution of faunal migration to carbon outwelling from mangroves and the current proposition, that the unaccounted-for 40-50% of mangrove C is exported as dissolved inorganic carbon, remains plausible.

AB  - Wrack (dead, washed-up seaweed and seagrass) buried in soft substrata causes increased organic content and alters the physical structure of sediments. These effects may influence the types and relative abundances of species in the sediment. Such influences can be expected to vary according to the type and organic content of the sediment. In this study, wrack was buried in 3 mudflats and 2 intertidal sandflats (with coarser sediments) in Botany Bay (New South Wales, Australia). The experiments tested the hypotheses that burial of wrack would (1) increase the content of total nitrogen (N) and organic carbon (OC) of sediments; (2) increase the biomass of micro-algae; and (3) alter the abundances of macrofauna in the sediments. Simulated wrack (equivalent amounts of plastic ribbon, without any organic content) was added to other experimental plots to test the above hypotheses when only physical disturbance, not organic enrichment, occurred. Total OC, N and chlorophyll a (chl a) were sampled every 2 wk for 6 wk and macrofauna were sampled after 6 wk. Some taxa (capitellid, orbinid and nereid worms) increased abundances where wrack was added. Nereidae, however, responded only in muddy sediments. The physical structure associated with wrack also caused an increase in numbers of Oligochaeta and increased patchiness in numbers of the soldier-crab Mictyris longicarpus, but only in sites where they were already abundant. Wrack represents a source of food for some taxa. Physical disturbance due to burial of wrack also adds to patchiness and abundance of taxa on sandy and muddy intertidal shores. The major responses of fauna predicted from other studies did not occur.

AB  - Holocene reconstructions of relative sea-level (RSL) and environmental change in the coastal zone have become progressively more numerous since the importance of assessing possible future sea-level rises has become apparent. Traditionally this has been achieved using a combination of biological and physical indicators (e.g. pollen, diatoms, foraminifera, grain size, etc.). In some circumstances, microfossils can be rare or absent from Holocene sediments and in these cases carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13)and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratios (C/N) can be used because they have the potential to provide information as to the origin of organic material preserved in coastal environments. The distinction in delta C-13 and ON of the various sources of carbon to estuarine sediments has led to its wide use as a tracer of carbon pathways and storage in estuaries. More recently these techniques have been applied to Holocene sediments to decipher changes in palaeocoastal environments and thus position relative to sea-level and/or palaeoriver discharge, which have direct relevance to palacoclimate. This paper reviews the studies that have utilised this technique and explores examples from a wide range of coastal environments (saltmarshes, estuaries, lagoons, isolation basins and fjords). It also discusses the potential alteration of geochemical signatures as a result of decompositional processes. Organic matter decomposition has been shown to change sediment delta C-13 and C/N values and thus an understanding of the processes involved is necessary in order to have confidence in the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of Holocerie delta C-13 and C/N. Decompositional shifts in UN, and particularly delta C-13, can occur over a relatively short time-period, however it is the direction of change in delta C-13 and C/N, rather than absolute values, that is key for interpreting changes in relative sea-level and thus such changes are commonly preserved.

AB  - Sulfur stable isotopes are increasingly being used as tracers of material processing in studies of both modern and historical food webs. Preparation of plant and animal material for isotope analysis routinely includes steps that remove inorganic material not normally assimilated by consumers. Whereas acidification of samples is known to assist with this for some elements (carbon), it can produce unwanted effects for others (nitrogen). Here we tested the effects of acidification on sulfur isotopes by comparing isotope ratios of paired acidified and non-acidified samples of seagrass, epiphytic algae growing on seagrass and animal consumers (3 types of crustaceans: amphipods, copepods and isopods). Acid treatment resulted in significant losses of elemental sulfur from the tissues and changes in sulfur isotope ratios of samples. The artificial depletion of the heavy sulfur isotope decreased sulfur isotope ratios by 2.6% on average, and by as much as 7.0% in individual samples. Acidification of samples prior to sulfur isotope analysis results in invalid ratios and should not be used.

AB  - Powell and Sakinaw Lakes are stably stratified ex-fjords, which became isolated from the Strait of Georgia approximately 11000 years ago by emerged sills due to post-glacial isostatic rebound. Both lakes contain highly sulphidic relict seawater (Powell 3.0 mM; Sakinaw 5.5 mM) at depth chemically analogous to porewaters of reducing marine sediments. Sakinaw has a very sharp chemocline located just below the oxic/anoxic interface, whereas in Powell, the interface is spread out over 200 m of the water column. Sulphate is present in the oxic part of the water column at much higher concentrations in Sakinaw Lake (up to 65 muM) than in Powell Lake (10 muM), and increases in concentration with depth until reaching the interface, below which it is rapidly depleted. Sulphur oxyanions of intermediate oxidation state (thiosulphate, sulphite, and tetrathionate) are not detectable in either lake. Particulate elemental sulphur was also not found in either lake. High concentrations of reduced iron and hydrogen sulphide result in formation of iron monosulphides and pyrite in the anoxic water columns of both lakes. The presence of these two minerals correlates well with their calculated saturation states. Pyrite precipitates with no apparent monosulphide precursor at depths where dissolved sulphide concentrations are low and monosulphide phases are undersaturated. As sulphide levels increase at greater depths, the waters become saturated with respect to iron monosulphides and particulate FeS species are detected in the water column. The large separation of the oxic/anoxic interface and the chemocline in Sakinaw (approximately 10 m) and especially in Powell Lake (approximately 100 m) relative to that of sediment porewaters allows excellent resolution of these processes.

AB  - Surface sediments were collected from various locations of the Mandovi estuary and the Marmugoa harbour. Sediments were analysed for organic carbon (OC), total lipids, n-alkanes concentration and composition. Concentrations of OC, total lipids and n-alkanes varied spatially and ranged from 1 to 2.5%,176 to 1413 mu g/g dry weight (dw) sediments, and 0.8 to 3.2 mu g/g dw sediments of the Mandovi estuary, respectively; and from 0.6 to 2.9%, 233 to 1448 mu g/g dw sediments, and 1.6 to 10.7 mu g/g dw sediments in the Marmugoa harbour, respectively. Long chain, odd carbon n-alkanes (C-23-C-33) in the Mandovi estuary, whereas short chain, even carbon n-alkanes (C-11-C-21) in the Marmugoa harbour sediments were more abundant. The total HC concentrations, n-alkane composition, CPI, UCM and other evaluation indices suggest the dominance of terrestrial hydrocarbons in the estuarine while petroleum derived hydrocarbons in the harbour sediments. This conclusion was further supported by the abundance of hopanes with C-29 to C-34 alpha, beta compounds and steranes with C-27, C-28 and C-29 compounds in the harbour sediments.

AB  - Variations in demographic parameters between intertidal populations of Nereis virens and Nephtys caeca were studied. These polychaetes are major component of the Macoma balthica community in the Lower St. Lawrence estuary (Quebec, Canada). We compared spatial distribution between differently oriented shores in a small geographic area. Our results revealed an interpopulation variability that appears to be dependent on hydrodynamical processes, edaphic parameters and biological interactions. In north and northeast oriented flats, the higher densities of young individuals of Nereis virens are found in the higher tidal levels where we observed larval recruitment and the highest organic matter contents. On the other hand, the lower densities of adult worms are found in the lowermost part of the intertidal zone, in which we observed the lowest organic matter contents and sandy sediment. As for the southwest facing tidal flats, the highest densities of immature individuals were observed in gravelly sediment of the lowermost tidal level. Also, mature individuals of Nereis are found on the uppermost part. Larval recruitment occurs in the central area of these bays. For the other species, Nephtys caeca, intertidal populations were dominated by juvenile individuals. Nevertheless, we remarked some bigger worms on the lower tidal level. The densities of Nephtys are higher in the sandy sediment and lower in the rich organic sediment. Interpopulation variability of Nereis appears to be dependent on many hydrodynamical effects (larval spatial patterns, hypsometric segregation of sediment organic matter, etc.) and the thickness of the colonizable sediment layer. Our results suggest that adult-juvenile interactions play an important role in population regulation of this polychaete. Interpopulation variability of Nephtys caeca seems to be mainly caused by the sediment texture, most probably dependent on hydrodynamical processes. We noted that larval settlement of Nephtys occurs in the most depth zones.

AB  - Microorganisms in tidal freshwater wetlands affect biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, but the structures and functions of the wetland communities change due to natural and anthropogenic stresses. Soil samples were collected along a 350-m sampling belt in typical tidal freshwater wetlands of Yellow River Delta to investigate nutrient distributions, bacterial community structures and potential metabolic functions under tide and runoff stress by high-throughput sequencing and PICRUSt analysis. The total nitrogen (TN) contents varied greatly while total phosphorous (TP) contents were relatively stable. The bacterial community structures and predicted functions varied along a 350-m sampling belt. Some sulfate-reducing bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, Marmoricola, unclassified_f_Salinisphaeraceae and Oceanococcus exhibited a decreased trend with increasing distances far away from the river bank (B-0m). However, Salinisphaera was more dominant far away from the river bank (B-350m), indicating the stronger tolerance degree under salt stress. Marinobacterium and Marinobacter could be widely detected from B-0m to B-350m, demonstrating that those bacteria could tolerate a broad range of salinity and have its exceptional adaptation capacities. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that nutrient and salinity played an important role in shaping bacterial community composition. NH4+-N and AP were the key factors in explaining the variance of the genus level. Predicted by PICRUSt analysis, nitrogen fixation (NF), nitrogen mineralization (NM), denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) might be the dominant processes of nitrogen metabolism and related genes abundance were abundant in tidal freshwater wetland soils. These findings could provide new insights into the prevention and control of potential nutrient pollution in tidal freshwater wetlands under the dual stress of tide and runoff. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Estuarine sediments store particulate contaminants including mercury (Hg). We studied Hg sediment dynamics in two intertidal mudflats at Great Bay estuary, NH, over multiple years. Sediments at both mudflats were physically mixed down to similar to 10 cm, as determined by Be-7 measurements, albeit via different mechanisms. Portsmouth mudflat (PT) sediments were subject to bioturbation by infaunal organisms and Squamscott mudflat (SQ) sediments were subject to erosion and redeposition. The presence of higher concentrations of fresh Fe(III) hydroxide at PT suggested bioirrigation by the polychaetes (Nereis virens). At depths where infaunal bioirrigation was observed, pore-water inorganic Hg (Hg-i) and methylmerculy (MeHg) were lower potentially due to their interaction with Fe(III) hydroxide. Methylmercury concentrations increased immediately below this zone in some samples, suggesting that the observed increase in material flux in bioirrigated sediments may initiate from lower depths. Pore water in sediment at PT also had higher fractions of more protein-like and labile DOC than those at SQ that can lead to increased MeHg production in PT, especially at depths where Hg, is not removed from solution by Fe(III) hydroxide. Where sediment erosion and redeposition were observed at SQ Hg species distribution was extended deeper into the sediment column. Moreover, methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR) and mercury reductase (mer-A) genes were higher at SQthan PT suggesting differences in conditions for Hg cycling. Results showed that the near-surface region of high MeHg concentrations commonly observed in unmixed sediments does not exist in physically mixed sediments that are common in many estuarine environments.

AB  - The composition and spatial distribution patterns of the macrobenthic faunal assemblages of an 8-ha tidal impoundment operated as a traditional shrimp pond at the Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve, Hong Kong, were studied in relation to temporal changes in local environmental conditions. Species richness, abundance and biomass of macrobenthos across 5 different sub-habitats (seaward, middle, and landward parts of open water unvegetated areas, and Phragmites- and Kandelia-dominated, vegetated areas) within the pond were examined bimonthly between January 1997 and January 1998. Grab samples were collected randomly within the sub-habitats. Key physical environmental parameters of the sampling sites were also measured. A total of 46 species of macrobenthos was recorded: 11 polychaetes, 11 molluscs, 13 crustaceans and 11 insects. Mean species density in the five sub-habitats ranged from 0 to 3907 ind.m(-2), with mean biomass ranging from 0 to 96.9 g.m(-2). The macrobenthos showed spatial and temporal differences among the sub-habitats and across sampling times. Species abundances of Polychaeta, Mollusca and Crustacea were significantly higher in the three open water areas than in the two vegetated ( Phragmites- and Kandelia-dominated) areas, with an inverse pattern for Insecta. There were no clear temporal patterns although abundance and biomass generally increased in the cooler months. Results of a canonical correspondence analysis suggest that macrobenthic species richness, abundance and biomass in the open areas were positively correlated with salinity, while water depth, dissolved oxygen and sediment organic matter content had little relationship with the macrobenthic assemblage parameters. Ordination by multi-dimensional scaling suggests that different habitats supported distinct macrobenthic assemblages. The macrobenthic assemblage in the tidal pond was less species rich but denser than those in the neighboring tidal mangrove and mudflat, suggesting that conversion of these areas into extensively managed tidal aquaculture ponds results in reduced species richness in tropical mangrove habitats.

AB  - Two types of commercial propane-powered traps, mosquito magnet (MM) (American Biophysics Corporation) MM-Freedom (R) (Freedom) and MM-Liberty Plus (R) (Liberty Plus), were evaluated for the collection of Culicoides. Trap preference and seasonal characteristics for the 3 major species, Culicoides furens, Culicoides barbosai, and Culicoides mississippiensis, were recorded from July 7, 2005, to July 24, 2006. Over 35 million Culicoides were captured during our study. When species were evaluated separately, analysis of overall mean trap collections yielded 5 months (February, March, June, September, and October) with significant trap effects. The Freedom trap captured more C. forens in June and October; the Liberty Plus trap captured more C mississippiensis in February, March, and April, and more C barbosai in September. The high numbers of Culicoides captured during our study suggest that the number of host-seeking Culicoides could potentially be reduced by continuous trapping during times when they are prevalent. Results of these investigations will be used to guide future control efforts.

AB  - Multiple techniques, including thermal infrared aerial remote sensing, geophysical and geological data, geochemical characterization and radium isotopes, were used to evaluate the role of groundwater as a source of dissolved nutrients, carbon, and trace gases to the Okatee River estuary, South Carolina. Thermal infrared aerial remote sensing surveys illustrated the presence of multiple submarine groundwater discharge sites in Okatee headwaters. Significant relationships were observed between groundwater geochemical constituents and Ra-226 activity in groundwater with higher Ra-226 activity correlated to higher concentrations of organics, dissolved inorganic carbon, nutrients, and trace gases to the Okatee system. A system-level radium mass balance confirmed a substantial submarine groundwater discharge contribution of these constituents to the Okatee River. Diffusive benthic flux measurements and potential denitrification rate assays tracked the fate of constituents in creek bank sediments. Diffusive benthic fluxes were substantially lower than calculated radium-based submarine groundwater discharge inputs, showing that advection of groundwater-derived nutrients dominated fluxes in the system. While a considerable potential for denitrification in tidal creek bank sediments was noted, in situ denitrification rates were nitrate-limited, making intertidal sediments an inefficient nitrogen sink in this system. Groundwater geochemical data indicated significant differences in groundwater chemical composition and radium activity ratios between the eastern and western sides of the river; these likely arose from the distinct hydrological regimes observed in each area. Groundwater from the western side of the Okatee headwaters was characterized by higher concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, inorganic nutrients and reduced metabolites and trace gases, i.e. methane and nitrous oxide, than groundwater from the eastern side. Differences in microbial sulfate reduction, organic matter supply, and/or groundwater residence time likely contributed to this pattern. The contrasting features of the east and west sub-marsh zones highlight the need for multiple techniques for characterization of submarine groundwater discharge sources and the impact of biogeochemical processes on the delivery of nutrients and carbon to coastal areas via submarine groundwater discharge.

AB  - Saltmarshes provide important services including flood control, climate regulation, and provisioning services when grazed by livestock for agriculture and conservation purposes. Grazing diminishes aboveground carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore, saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services, there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland. We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer Hebrides, the breakeven carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services, especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting sensitive habitats.

AB  - Evaluating the effectiveness and success of coastal marine habitat restoration is often highly challenging and can vary substantially between different habitat types. The current article presents a state-of-the-art review of habitat-level restoration in the coastal marine environment. It sets out most successful techniques across habitats and suggestions of better metrics to assess their success. Improvements in restoration approach are outlined, with a particular focus on selective breeding, using recent advancements in genetics. Furthermore, the assessment of ecosystem services, as a metric to determine restoration success on a spatiotemporal scale, is addressed in this article. As the concept of ecosystem services is more tangible for a nonscientific audience, evaluating restoration success in this manner has the potential to greatly contribute to raising awareness of environmental issues and to implement socioeconomic policies. Moreover, habitat-based restoration has been proven to be an effective tool to address the issue of ecosystem service sustainability and poverty alleviation. Appropriate conservation management, prior to the implementation of restoration activities, is crucial to create an environment in which restoration efforts are likely to succeed.

AB  - Utilization of C-14-labeled lignocellulose by the ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn) was evaluated under simulated intertidal (50/50% exposure/submergence) and subtidal (100% submergence) conditions.  Ingestation rates of mussels fed on [C-14] lignocellulose did not differ significantly between mussels held in intertidal and subtidal conditions.  The mean ( +/- SE) C-14 absorption efficiency for intertidal mussels fed [C-14] lignocellulose was 14.9 +/- 0.5% in summer (June 1986) and 6.7 +/- 0.5% in fall (October 1988).  Mean ( +/- SE) summer (9.1 +/- 0.6%) and fall (4.0 +/- 0.2%) C-14 absorption efficiencies of subtidal mussels fed [C-14] lignocellulose were significantly lower (t test, p < 0.05) than those of intertidal mussels.  It was estimated that the contribution of lignocellulose to the total summer energy requirements of intertidal and subtidal G. demissa was similar at 5.7 and 5.3%, respectively.  Reduced metabolic expenditures and higher absorption efficiencies allow G. demissa to compensate for a limited period of feeding on lignocellulose in its intertidal habitat.

AB  - We present the first data set on the evolution and Holocene infilling of the Potengi River Estuary at the NE Brazilian Continental Margin near the city of Natal. The study is based on integrated sedimentological, geochemical and palaeontological information from 6 boreholes drilled in the area of estuarine mangroves, complemented by radiocarbon dating of the in situ remains of mangrove vegetation. Four samples taken close to the pre-inundation substratum set the baseline of reference points for the sea-level reconstruction. This palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, coupled with a C-14 age model, complements previous sea-level studies along the Rio Grande do Norte coast, which have been based primarily on beach-rocks and other on-shore exposed sedimentary materials.
   A rapid sea-level rise, at an averaged rate of approximately 6.1 mm/yr(-1), occurred between 8300 and 7000 cal. yr BP. Since then, the pace of relative sea-level rise slowed and non-eustatic factors, namely terrigenous sediment supply and coastal dynamics, became dominant in the evolution of the estuary.
   The post-transgression period witnessed the decline of mangroves, whose remnants were identified mostly in the initial 2 m of Holocene estuarine sediments. Accelerated sea-level rise, combined with geomorphological con, finement of the studied intertidal zone, was probably responsible for the demise of halophyte vegetation, which thrived again in the late Holocene.

AB  - To evaluate how mangrove invasion and removal can modify short-term benthic carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning, we used stable-isotopically labeled algae as a deliberate tracer to quantify benthic respiration and C-flow over 48 h through macrofauna and bacteria in sediments collected from (1) an invasive mangrove forest, (2) deforested mangrove sites 2 and 6 years after removal of above-sediment mangrove biomass, and (3) two mangrove-free control sites in the Hawaiian coastal zone. Sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) rates averaged over each 48 h investigation were significantly greater in the mangrove and mangrove removal site experiments than in controls and were significantly correlated with total benthic (macrofauna and bacteria) biomass and sedimentary mangrove biomass (SMB). Bacteria dominated short-term C-processing of added microalgal-C and benthic biomass in sediments from the invasive mangrove forest habitat and in the 6-yr removal site. In contrast, macrofauna were the most important agents in the short-term processing of microalgal-C in sediments from the 2-yr mangrove removal site and control sites. However, mean faunal abundance and C-uptake rates in sediments from both removal sites were significantly higher than in control cores, which collectively suggest that community structure and short-term C-cycling dynamics of sediments in habitats where mangroves have been cleared can remain fundamentally different from un-invaded mudflat sediments for at least 6-yrs following above-sediment mangrove removal. In summary, invasion by mangroves can lead to dramatic shifts in benthic ecosystem function, with sediment metabolism, benthic community structure and short-term C-remineralization dynamics being affected for years following invader removal.

AB  - Pb-210 is widely used for dating recent sediments in the aquatic environment; however, our experiences working in shallow coastal environments in the Pacific coast of Mexico have demonstrated that the potential of Pb-210 for reliable historical reconstructions might be limited by the low Pb-210 atmospheric fallout, sediment mixing, abundance of coarse sediments and the lack of Cs-137 signal for Pb-210 corroboration. This work discusses the difficulties in obtaining adequate sedimentary records for geochronological reconstruction in such active and complex settings, including examples of Pb-210 geochronologies based on sediment profiles collected in two contrasting areas coastal areas (mudflats associated to coastal lagoons of Sinaloa State and the continental shelf of the Gulf of Tehuantepec), in which geochemical data was used to support the temporal frame established and the changes in sediment supply recorded in the sediment cores which were related to the development of land-based activities during the last century.

AB  - Life cycle, population dynamics and productivity of the larviparous mudsnail species Ventrosia maritima were investigated at low salinities (0.3-6 psu) in differentiated parts of a Mediterranean lagoon (Monolimni Lagoon). Monthly samples were collected during the period from February 1998 to February 1999 in both parts of the lagoon. Ventrosia maritima displayed an annual life cycle. Recruitment occurred in summer and autumn at the outer part of the lagoon and additionally in late winter at the innermost part. A positive correlation was found between the percentages of small individuals and salinity or sediment organic matter at the outer part. Growth practically ceased in winter. The mudsnail displayed remarkable densities and an increase in growth in spring at < 1 psu indicating that it is highly tolerant to extremely low salinities. Population density showed a significant seasonal variation; it increased from early summer to autumn (30,000-40,000 individuals m(-2)) following the summer and autumn recruitment. No significant correlation between the density of V. maritima and several examined physicochemical variables was found; a negative correlation was observed between the density of the mudisnail and that of the co-occurring polychaete Streblospio shrubsolii. Secondary production calculated by the size-frequency method gave a mean annual density (N) of 9740 ind m(-2), a mean biomass (B) of 1.66 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m(-2) y(-1), a production (P) of 4.51 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 2.72 at the outer part of the lagoon and a N of 14,570 ind m(-2), a B of 3.2 g AFDW m(-2) y(-1), a P of 9.9 g m(-2) y(-1) and a P:B ratio of 3.09 at the innermost part. At the innermost part of the lagoon, where the seawater renewal rate and hydro-dynamism were lower and the sediment finer and organically richer, V. maritima displayed more recruitment pulses, a larger body size and a denser and more productive population than the one at the outer part. Our findings are compared to published data for the direct-developing congeners V. ventrosa and V. truncata.

AB  - Mineralogical and chemical analysis (major and minor elements, such as heavy metals) of sediments in the Brouage area indicates that the clay-rich muds deposited were derived from the major coastal rivers, the Gironde and the Loire. Certain clays, high smectite content mixed layer minerals, are under-represented suggesting loss to the open ocean. Relatively important related concentrations of Cd, As, Zn and Sn, higher than those in river sediments of the area, suggest a concentration increasing with time in costal material. It is of course possible that coastal contamination, independent of river input, has contributed to these concentrations. A second experiment involves destruction of organic matter in the clay fraction sediment samples which shows a greatly increased phosphorous concentration and a strong relation to Cd and As. This action could have implications for biological cycles in the mudflat environment.

AB  - The Changjiang River estuary is the most eutrophic estuary in China. Although anthropogenic input from the Changjiang River (the third-largest river in the world) is considered the main source of nitrogen, the contributions of newly regenerated nitrogen from deep waters may be underestimated, in part due to the lack of information on the nitrogen biogeochemical processes that are occurring. The nitrogen stable isotope ratio is widely used as an indicator of the source of nitrogen and nitrogen transformation processes including assimilation, nitrification, nitrogen fixation and mineralization. To study the biogeochemical processes in the Changjiang River estuary, seasonal variations in the nitrogen stable isotope ratio of nitrate (delta(NO3)-N-15), salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, and the composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were investigated along two transects in the estuary in 2010. In the surface waters, assimilation between May and November was suggested by high Chl a and delta(NO3)-N-15 and supported by the mixing behavior of the nitrate and delta(NO3)-N-15. From February to November, the mean nitrate content in the deep waters gradually increased (from similar to 8 to similar to 15 mu mol l(-1)), whereas the mean delta(NO3)-N-15 decreased (from similar to 2 parts per thousand to similar to-2 parts per thousand). Particularly in November, most of the delta(NO3)-N-15 values in the deep waters were negative (similar to-5 parts per thousand -0 parts per thousand, which is much lower than the similar to 3 parts per thousand riverine input from delta(NO3)-N-15), indicating that most of the nitrates in the deep water were newly regenerated from nitrification rather than originating from riverine input Additionally, the mean ammonium abruptly increased (from similar to 2 to similar to 20 mu mol l(-1)) in the deep waters during November when the delta(NO3)-N-15 values were negative, whereas in August, high Chl a values were observed in the deep waters. These results indicate that remineralization and nitrification occurred in the deep waters of the Changjiang River estuary, implying that regenerated nitrogen may also be an important nitrogen source for uptake by phytoplankton.

AB  - The loss of coastal wetlands throughout the Hawaiian Islands has increased the numbers of created (CW) and restored (RW) wetlands. An assessment of these wetlands has yet to occur, and it has not been determined whether CWs and RWs provide the same functions as natural wetlands (NWs). To address these concerns, vegetation and soil characteristics of 35 wetlands were compared within sites along hydrologic gradients and among sites with different surface water salinity and status (i.e., CW, RW, NW). Only 16 of 85 plant species identified were native and three of the four most abundant species were exotic. Vegetative characteristics differed primarily across salinity classes, then along hydrologic zones, and to a lesser extent among CWs, RWs, and NWs. Soil properties exhibited fewer differences across salinity classes and along hydrologic zones and greater differences among CWs, RWs, and NWs. The dominant presence of invasive species in coastal Hawaiian wetlands suggests that it will be difficult to locate reference sites that can be used as restoration targets. Differences in edaphic characteristics suggested that RWs/CWs do not exhibit the same functions as NWs. Future restoration and creation should include planting of native vegetation, controlling invasive vegetation, and alleviating inadequate soil conditions.

AB  - Methane is considered one of the most important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Because of the strict anaerobic conditions required by CH4-generating microorganisms, natural wetland ecosystems are one of the main sources of biogenic CH4. The total natural wetland area is estimated to be 5.3 to 5.7 x 10(12) m(2), making up less than 5% of the Earth's land surface. However, natural wetland plays a disproportionately large role in CH4 emissions. Wetlands are likely the largest natural sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, accounting for about 20% of the current global annual emission. Out of the total amount of CH4 emitted, northern wetlands contribute 34%, temperate wetlands 5%, and tropical systems about 60%.
   Because of the unique characteristics and high productivity, wetland ecosystems are important in the global carbon cycle. Natural wetlands are permanently or temporarily saturated. Strict anaerobic conditions consequently develop, which allows methanogenesis to occur. But the thin oxic layer and the oxic plant rhizophere promote activity of CH4-oxidizing bacteria or methanotrophs. Thus, both CH4 formation and consumption in wetland systems are microbiological processes and are controlled by many factors. Eight of the controlling factors, including carbon supply, soil oxidation-reduction status, pH, temperature, vegetation, salinity and sulfate content, soil hydrological conditions and CH4 oxidation are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Mud shrimps, Upogebia spp., are major constituents of macrobenthic communities in tidal flats in Japan. The impact of Upogebia yokoyai on carbon flow on tidal flats was examined by comparing CO2 emission rates from plots with and without burrows in the Kurose River estuary, Japan. In situ CO2 emission rates from plots with burrows were significantly higher than from those without. Laboratory measurements using sediment core samples that excluded respiration of macrobenthic organisms showed similar trends. Although there were no significant differences in grain size distribution, water content, or ignition loss between the sediment cores with and without burrows, oxidation-reduction potential was significantly higher in sediment cores with burrows. Analysis of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) indicated that microbial biomass and community structure did not differ significantly between cores with and without burrows. However, microbial respiration activity, as indicated by CO2 emission rates per total PLFA content, was significantly higher in sediment cores with burrows than in those without. Our results indicate that burrows of U. yokoyai change the physicochemical conditions and increase microbial activity in the sediment, significantly affecting carbon flow in the tidal flat.

AB  - A sequential technique for extraction of metals from sediments (modified Tessier method) - was used to determine the distribution of the metals Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn in the major sedimentary phases (available, reducible, oxidisable, and residual) in marine sediment samples from six Red Sea Islands. The total metal content was also determined. The oxidizable fraction showed strong association of the metals with organic matter and sulfides. Overall, the total trace metal concentrations in the sediment samples were lower than in previous studies, except for Cd, Pb, and Zn, caused by increasing human activities and landfilling operations on the Red Sea coast. Descriptive data analysis was performed by using statistical method.

AB  - Worldwide, coastal systems provide some of the most productive habitats, which potentially influence a range of marine and terrestrial ecosystems through the transfer of nutrients and energy. Several reviews have examined aspects of connectivity within coastal seascapes, but the scope of those reviews has been limited to single systems or single vectors. We use the transfer of carbon to examine the processes of connectivity through multiple vectors in multiple ecosystems using four coastal seascapes as case studies. We discuss and compare the main vectors of carbon connecting different ecosystems, and then the natural and human-induced factors that influence the magnitude of effect for those vectors on recipient systems. Vectors of carbon transfer can be grouped into two main categories: detrital particulate organic carbon (POC) and its associated dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC/DIC) that are transported passively; and mobile consumers that transport carbon actively. High proportions of net primary production can be exported over meters to hundreds of kilometers from seagrass beds, algal reefs and mangroves as POC, with its export dependent on wind-generated currents in the first two of these systems and tidal currents for the last. By contrast, saltmarshes export large quantities of DOC through tidal movement, while land run-off plays a critical role in the transport of terrestrial POC and DOC into temperate fjords. Nekton actively transfers carbon across ecosystem boundaries through foraging movements, ontogenetic migrations, or trophic relays', into and out of seagrass beds, mangroves or saltmarshes. The magnitude of these vectors is influenced by: the hydrodynamics and geomorphology of the region; the characteristics of the carbon vector, such as their particle size and buoyancy; and for nekton, the extent and frequency of migrations between ecosystems. Through a risk-assessment process, we have identified the most significant human disturbances that affect the integrity of connectivity among ecosystems. Loss of habitat, net primary production (NPP) and overfishing pose the greatest risks to carbon transfer in temperate saltmarsh and tropical estuaries, particularly through their effects on nekton abundance and movement. In comparison, habitat/NPP loss and climate change are likely to be the major risks to carbon transfer in temperate fjords and temperate open coasts through alteration in the amount of POC and/or DOC/DIC being transported. While we have highlighted the importance of these vectors in coastal seascapes, there is limited quantitative data on the effects of these vectors on recipient systems. It is only through quantifying those subsidies that we can effectively incorporate complex interactions into the management of the marine environment and its resources.

AB  - In the previous half century, it has presented a broad interest in promoting the multipurpose application of waste phosphogypsum (PG). Owing to its effects in the improvement of soil properties, PG has been widely utilized in agriculture field as an amendment. Although the application of PG in agriculture can make a good economic profit, the relevant research is very inadequate compared to the application in other fields. An integrated review of a large amount of research on agriculture utilization of PG as a soil improver was carried out in this study, including the PG properties, application scopes, improvement effects, and environmental risks. Waste PG presents a plenty of effects in agriculture utilization as a soil amendment, e.g., improving soil physicochemical properties, reducing heavy metal leaching, lessening soil loss, supplying beneficial trace elements, and promoting crop growth. However, waste PG contains high contents of salts, heavy metals, and some natural radionuclides. Therefore, some key aspects regarding PG application in agriculture should be concerned, e.g., the long-range effects of PG on the soil quality, heavy metal accumulation, radiological impact, plant development and crop quality. Moreover, the amelioration effects of mixing PG with other various amendments should be discussed to advance the agriculture utilization of PG. The issues of salt concentration, heavy metal toxicity, and radiological impact due to extra addition also need to be resolved when waste PG is utilized in agricultural field. Due to the limitation of environmental risks, the utilization conditions of PG in agriculture should be determined. In addition, some standards and regulations for the practical utilization of PG should be put forward to effectively guide the application of PG in agriculture. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In 2010 the Conference of the Parties (COP) for the Convention on Biological Diversity revised and updated a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Here a group of early career researchers mentored by senior scientists, convened as part of the 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity, reflects on the accomplishments and shortfalls under four of the Aichi Targets considered highly relevant to marine conservation: target 6 (sustainable fisheries), 11 (protection measures), 15 (ecosystem restoration and resilience) and 19 (knowledge, science and technology). We conclude that although progress has been made towards the targets, these have not been fully achieved for the marine environment by the 2020 deadline. The progress made, however, lays the foundations for further work beyond 2020 to work towards the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity. We identify key priorities that must be addressed to better enable marine biodiversity conservation efforts moving forward.

AB  - In anoxic Spartina alterniflora-dominated sediments along a naturally occuring salinity gradient (the Cooper River estuary, South Carolina, U.S.A.), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was metabolized to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylate by sediment microbes. The race of DMSP degradation and acrylate mineralization by sediment microbes was similar at all sites along this 25-km transect. However, sediments amended with acrylate (or DMSP) showed significantly higher rates of N-2 fixation (measured as acetylene reduction activity) (ARA) in the saline sediments downstream than brackish sediments. These results are consistent with the fact that acrylate stimulated the rates of both denitrification and CO2, production in the saline sediments at the mouth of the river more than tenfold over rates in brackish sediments. Enrichment experiments indicate that microbes capable of using DMSP or acrylate were not present in upstream sediments despite the fact that microbial biomass, percent organic matter, and both glucose-stimulated ARA and denitrification were highest upstream. It appears that acrylate utilizing, N-2 fixing, and denitrifying populations are insignificant in the lower salinity sediments of the estuary. These results may reflect the availability of DMSP, which averaged 10.3 nmol g wet wt(-1) of saline sediments and levels less than our detection limit (1 mu M) in brackish sediments.

AB  - Feeding by sesarmid crabs on plants represents an important energy pathway within some estuarine ecosystems. We examined the trophic ecology of estuarine sesarmid crabs Sesarma catenata through a series of laboratory feeding-preference experiments. Our experiments considered decomposed and mature leaves of terrestrial riparian trees, marsh plants Chenolea diffusa and Sarcocornia perennis and the marshgrass Spartina maritima as potential food items. S. catenata preferred decomposed leaves of terrestrial riparian trees, followed by decomposed and mature leaves of S. maritima. We suggest that the low carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios of S. maritima and high bacterial production associated with decomposed terrestrial leaves may explain the trophic behaviour of S. catenata. The faecal production by S. catenata during these experiments confirmed the preferential assimilation of decomposed material by the crabs. By combining the consumption rates with an estimated density of S. catenata within the local estuary that it inhabits, we suggest that moderate proportions of the leaf material can potentially be consumed by this species (34% of total leaf litter), leaving substantial amounts of unconsumed leaf litter that may represent an important subsidy for adjacent environments. Our results validate previously published trophic data, showing the value of linking feeding experiments with biological tracers to improve food-web models.

AB  - Respiratory rates of microbial plankton in five estuaries of Georgia, U.S.A. are similar at any given time of year, both within and among the estuaries, but change from 0.16 +/- 0.02 muM h(-1) (mean +/- SE) in winter to 0.95 +/- 0.08 muM h(-1) in summer, following the Arrhenius law. In short-term enrichment experiments, heterotrophs respond to added labile carbon, thus indicating a dual temperature-substrate limitation. The relatively much greater microbial metabolic rates in the marsh sediments than in estuarine water, the dominance of estuarine primary production in south-eastern U.S.A. by higher plants, and limited phytoplankton production in turbid water may explain the carbon limitation. Respiratory rates of south-eastern U.S.A. continental shelf microbial plankton are 1.1 +/- 0.14 muM h(-1) near shore in winter and 0.95 +/- 0.08 muM O-2 h(-1) in summer. In mid-shelf they are 0.7 +/- 0.11 in winter and 1.3 +/- 0.28 in summer, and at the edge of the Gulf Stream they are 0.3 +/- 0.1 in winter and 1.0 +/- 0.3 in summer. Thus, in contrast to the estuaries, microbial respiration in shelf waters is as high throughout the year as estuarine respiration in summer, showing no significant seasonal change, but: respiration in the Gulf Stream changes seasonally. Although primary production on the south-eastern shelf is relatively high, especially near shore and in intrusions of North Atlantic Central Water, no correlation was found between respiratory rates of microbial plankton and concentrations of chlorophyll a. Concentrations of dissolved free amino acids in continental shelf waters are 39-87 nM with no evident seasonal cycle. Compared to other estuarine-shelf systems, the south-eastern system is known not to be highly productive of higher trophic levels, i.e. fishes and shellfish. We postulate that this is a result of the trophic structure on the south-eastern U.S. continental shelf system which in rum is a consequence of the distribution of macronutrients, principally nitrogen. Most new nitrogen is from the North Atlantic Central Water rather than from terrestrial sources and, therefore, it is less well distributed over the central shelf. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Fringing wetlands are critical components of estuarine systems, and subject to water fluxes from both watersheds and estuaries. To assess the effect of groundwater discharge on marsh nitrogen cycling, we measured N-cycling in sediments from a fringing mesohaline marsh in Virginia which receives a seasonal groundwater input. Mineralization, nitrification, potential denitrification (DNF), and potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) rates were estimated along with porewater concentrations of oxygen, sulfide, and conductivity during high (May 1997) and low (October 1997) groundwater discharge. All N-cycling processes were confined to the upper 1 to 1.5 m of marsh, where organic matter and ammonium were most abundant. Depth-integrated rates for mineralization, nitrification, DNRA, and DNF ranged between 1.0-11.2, 0.0-2.2, 0.9-6.1, and 1.8-17.6 mmol N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. During spring discharge (May), porewater conductivity, and dissolved sulfide decreased by approximately 50%, and a groundwater-driven O-2 flux of 27 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) into the marsh subsurface was estimated, Although mineralization, nitrification, and DNRA rates were up to 12x, 6x, and 7.5x greater in May. respectively, than during low discharge (October), DNF was 10x higher in October. The largest difference in seasonal rates was observed nearest the upland border, where groundwater discharge had the greatest effect on sediment geochemistry. We suggest that a synergy between an increased flux of electron accepters, porewater mixing, and flushing of salt and sulfide was responsible for the elevated mineralization and nitrification rates in May. Natural-abundance delta N-15 measurements of the NH4+, NO3-, and N-2 pools showed that nitrification is important in mediating N export by linking mineralization and denitrification in this marsh. However, despite accelerated mineralization and nitrification in May, there was not an equivalently large export of N via coupled nitrification-denitrification. The DNF:DNRA ratio in May (0.6) was 25-fold lower than that seen at low discharge, indicating that during spring discharge, a greater proportion of nitrified N was recycled internally rather than exported via denitrification.

AB  - Bar-built estuaries are coastal environments characterized by the partial closure of the estuary's mouth with a sandbar barrier for extended periods (closed state). Through natural events (rainfall) or anthropogenic influences, the sandbar is breached, reopening the estuary to the ocean. The transition from closed to open state often leads to extensive physical and chemical changes in the estuarine conditions, as water mixing and sediment resuspension are increased, which could result in the oxidation of sediment acid-volatile sulfides (AVS). We followed monthly changes in water's and sediment geochemical characteristics at thirty-two sites spanning the Pescadero Estuary over a one-year period. We showed that the transition from closed to open state leads to significant decreases in aqueous pH to circumneutral values and significant increases in aqueous hydrogen sulfide and iron concentrations to 10.6 mu M and 59.1 mu M, respectively, due to sediment AVS oxidation following sediment resuspension. Aqueous hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in both closed and open states were significantly higher than the recommended thresholds for aquatic life. Moreover, mildly acidic water conditions in the open state were lower than the recommended limits for aquatic life. Our spatial analysis further highlighted that some parts of the estuary were more vulnerable to decreased water quality. Indeed, high sediment AVS contents (19-24 mmol kg(-1)) were observed year-round at the River Confluence and Butano Creek regions, which implies a high potential for severe water acidification and metal release when the estuary transitions from closed to open state.

AB  - Alterations of hydrology are known to trigger changes in coastal ecosystems, such as the composition and abundances of local flora and fauna. It is less well known how these alterations lead to changes in nutrient and energy transfers in these systems. We used comparisons of stable isotope signatures (delta (13)C, delta (15)N, and delta (34)S) in the tissues of conspecific plants and animals collected on each side of the Mobile Bay Causeway to determine the extent to which the causeway may have altered energy and nutrient exchange between the Mobile-Tensaw Delta and upper Mobile Bay. While the delta (13)C signatures of most plants and animals varied irrespective of their location relative with causeway location, their delta (15)N and delta (34)S signatures were almost always more enriched south of the causeway, indicating significant alterations of trophic linkages within this estuarine food web. Dual isotope plots and mixing model analyses indicated that while terrestrial and floating plants were trophically important to consumers north of the causeway, submerged aquatic vegetation was more important to consumers south of the causeway. Although limited in spatial and temporal scale, our results preliminarily show that there are noteworthy differences in stable isotope signatures most likely due to the Mobile Bay Causeway altering energy and nutrient transference.

AB  - Parallel mineralogical, geochemical, and lipid biomarker analyses of sedimentary siderite concretions and their host sediments were undertaken to give detailed information about the microbially mediated diagenetic processes involved. Concretions were collected from two contrasting environments at Warham, north Norfolk-typical brownish silty marsh sediment and black anaerobic mud from a creek bank-but no major differences in their mineralogy or geochemistry were found. Samples consisted of siderite, amorphous iron oxides, and iron sulfides with more carbonate present in the outer than in the inner parts. Subsamples from the concretions were found to be more similar to each other in their sulfide and organic carbon contents than to the host sediments. The microbiological characteristics revealed by lipid biomarker analysis showed considerable variation between concretions and host sediments, between individual concretions, and between inner and outer parts of the concretions. The predominant sulfate-reducing bacteria were more numerous in the concretions than in host sediments, but varied greatly within the concretions. The biomarker i17:1 omega 7c for Desulfovibrio was enriched within the concretions, suggesting that these bacteria, which are capable of reducing iron directly, played an important role in concretion formation. The lipid biomarker data indicated that the bacterial community changed during concretion formation and that different conditions for preservation existed in the concretions compared with the host sediments.

AB  - There is concern that accelerating sea-level rise will exceed the vertical growth capacity of coastal-wetland substrates in many regions by the end of this century. Vertical vulnerability estimates rely on measurements of accretion and/or surface-elevation-change derived from soil cores and/or surface elevation tables (SETs). To date there has not been a broad examination of whether the multiple timescales represented by the processes of accretion and elevation change are equally well-suited for quantifying the trajectories of wetland vertical change in coming decades and centuries. To examine the potential for timescale bias in assessments of vertical change, we compared rates of accretion and surface elevation change using data derived from a review of the literature. In the first approach, average rates of elevation change were compared with timescale-averaged accretion rates from six regions around the world where sub-decadal, decadal, centennial, and millennial timescales were represented. Second, to isolate spatial variability, temporal comparisons were made for regionally unique environmental categories within each region. Last, comparisons were made of records from sites where SET-MH stations and radiometric measurements were co-located in close proximity. We find that rates vary significantly as a function of measurement timescale and that the pattern and magnitude of variation between timescales are location-specific. Failure to identify and account for temporal variability in rates will produce biased assessments of the vertical change capacity of coastal wetlands. Robust vulnerability assessments should combine accretion rates from multiple timescales with the longest available SET record to provide long-term context for ongoing monitoring observations and projections.

AB  - Research spanning over 40 years has examined many aspects of the microbial ecology of the Colne estuary (Essex, United Kingdom) and it is arguably the most comprehensively understood temperate estuary in the Northern hemisphere. The hypernutrified Colne estuary exhibits strong gradients of nutrient concentrations (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, dissolved organic nitrogen) from river and treated sewage inputs at the top of the estuary, with concentrations decreasing towards the estuary mouth. These strong concentration gradients facilitate the study of the biogeochemical process rates and the microbial communities responsible. Planktonic primary production is at an oligotrophic level because of light limitation in the turbid water, but a mixed water column maintains planktonic photosynthesis despite low light. Dense micro-hytobenthic biofilms occur throughout the estuary, with high rates of annual primary production typical of NW European nutrient-rich estuaries, but benthic primary production accounts for only a small proportion of the N load to the estuary. Organic matter degradation is focussed in the estuarine sediments, with greatest organic content in the upper estuary, decreasing towards the mouth. Benthic biogeochemical processes, leading to organic mineralisation and element recycling, including O-2 uptake, sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, nitrate reduction, denitrification and anammox have all been quantified along the estuary, together with chemolithotrophic nitrification. Benthic denitrification removes a significant proportion of the N load to the estuary. Molecular techniques, including profiling, identification and quantification of 16S rRNA and key functional genes, have provided an understanding of the microbial communities in relation to position and biogeochemical activity. The concentrations and emissions of biological volatile compounds (nitrous oxide, methane, hydrogen sulphide and isoprene) have also been measured, and their ecological significance elucidated. Tidal exchange between the saltmarshes and the main estuary channel shows seasonal variation. When nitrate in tidal water is high in spring, the marsh sediments remove it, but tidally export ammonium and small particles of organic nitrogen to the estuary in summer when nitrogen in coastal water is low. Overall, the saltmarshes show a balanced nitrogen cycle suggestive of a stable climax community, but capable of responding to and removing increased nitrate concentrations in estuarine waters. These data, originating from the long-term study of a single system, are unique and this paper highlights how the Colne estuary microbial ecology observatory has contributed to our understanding of estuarine microbial ecology and biogeochemistry.

AB  - Ascomycetous fungal decomposers generate the major part of the microbial biomass on and in standing naturally decaying shoots for one (smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora) of the two major ramet-forming marsh plants of the south-eastern USA. Evidence from frequency of occurrence of sexual structures (ascomata) in the second major ramet-forming marsh plant (black needlerush, Juncus roemerianus) suggests that fungi are major secondary producers in the needlerush decomposition system also. To test this, samples of needlerush blades at three stages of decay were collected seasonally for three years. Average living-fungal standing crop (as ergosterol) of needlerush blades (254 mug g(-1) organic mass of decay system) was similar to 65% of a comparable average for smooth cordgrass, but fungal mass was equally active between the two species (near 30 pmol acetate incorporated into ergosterol mug(-1) ergosterol h(-1)). Although maximum living-fungal crop for needlerush was found in winter, and in winter and spring for smooth cordgrass, in many other respects, patterns of change in needlerush fungal variables were quite different from those for smooth cordgrass. For example, living-fungal standing crop rose 1.5-fold with decay stage for needlerush, but was constant for cordgrass, perhaps because of lesser mycophagous activity and lesser competition from bacterioplankton associated with tidal flooding in the high-marsh, needlerush zones.

AB  - Orthophosphate concentrations in the Swartkops estuary mouth were determined during the first spring and neap tides of twelve successive lunar months.  The volume of water entering or leaving the estuary during the ebb and flood phases of the tide was derived using a one-dimensional numerical model.  By integrating the flow of water and the phosphate concentration, the flux of phosphate could be determined.  Seasonal, tidal and phase-of-tide differences in flux were found, but generally there was a net export of phosphate during both spring and neap tides, yielding an annual net export of 24.4 tonnes.

AB  - Estuaries exhibit a wide array of human impacts that can compromise their ecological integrity, because of rapid population growth and uncontrolled development in many coastal regions worldwide. Long-term environmental problems plaguing estuaries require remedial actions to improve the viability and health of these valuable coastal systems. Detailed examination of the effects of pollution inputs, the loss and alteration of estuarine habitat, and the role of other anthropogenic stress indicates that water quality in estuaries, particularly urbanized systems, is often compromised by the overloading of nutrients and organic matter, the influx of pathogens, and the accumulation of chemical contaminants. In addition, the destruction of fringing wetlands and the loss and alteration of estuarine habitats usually degrade biotic communities. Estuaries are characterized by high population densities of microbes, plankton, benthic flora and fauna, and nekton; however, these organisms tend to be highly vulnerable to human activities in coastal watersheds and adjoining embayments. Trends suggest that by 2025 estuaries will be most significantly impacted by habitat loss and alteration associated with a burgeoning coastal population, which is expected to approach six billion people. Habitat destruction has far reaching ecological consequences, modifying the structure, function, and controls of estuarine ecosystems and contributing to the decline of biodiversity. Other anticipated high priority problems are excessive nutrient and sewage inputs to estuaries, principally from land-based sources. These inputs will lead to the greater incidence of eutrophication as well as hypoxia and anoxia. During the next 25 years, overfishing is expected to become a more pervasive and significant anthropogenic factor, also capable of mediating global-scale change to estuaries. Chemical contaminants, notably synthetic organic compounds, will remain a serious problem, especially in heavily industrialized areas. Freshwater diversions appear to be an emerging global problem as the expanding coastal population places greater demands on limited freshwater supplies for agricultural, domestic, and industrial needs. Altered freshwater flows could significantly affect nutrient loads, biotic community structure, and the trophodynamics of estuarine systems. Ecological impacts that will be less threatening, but still damaging, are those caused by introduced species, sea level rise, coastal subsidence, and debris/litter. Although all of these disturbances can alter habitats and contribute to shifts in the composition of estuarine biotic communities, the overall effect will be partial changes to these ecosystem components. Several strategies may mitigate future impacts.

AB  - Sea level rise increases the frequency and intensity of storm surges and extreme tidal events in coastal freshwater wetlands. Seawater affects soil biogeochemical processes by inducing osmotic stress and stimulating SO(4)(2-) reduction. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which salinity alters C mineralization rates by quantifying the relative importance of ionic stress, compared with the addition of the SO(4)(2-) electron acceptor, on the production of CO(2) and CH(4). A batch incubation study measured potential anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis with time in a freshwater wetland soil exposed to varying concentrations (3.5, 14, and 35 g kg(-1)) of seawater or salt (NaCl) solutions. Seawater addition induced a short-term (2-wk) stimulation of CO(2) production (20-32% greater than the freshwater control) and a continuous suppression of CH(4) production (up to 94% less than freshwater). Ionic stress (represented by NaCl) did not reduce CO(2) production at all but did decrease CH(4) production for 2 wk in both the 14 and 35 g kg(-1) NaCl treatments. Our results indicate that microbial populations rebound quickly from ionic stress. The intrusion of dilute seawater (3.5 g kg(-1)) to freshwater wetlands can accelerate organic C mineralization through the short-term increase in SO(4)(2-)-induced respiration without inhibiting methanogenesis. Overall, the organic C mineralization rate was 17% higher for 3.5 g kg(-1) seawater than the freshwater control. The temporary nature of the microbial response suggests that "pulses" of seawater may have a greater influence on the rate of C cycling in freshwater wetlands than a gradual sea level rise.

AB  - We measured the extent of movement of carbon and its assimilation by invertebrates among estuarine habitats by analysing carbon stable isotopes of invertebrates collected along transects crossing the boundary of two habitats. The habitats were dominated by autotrophs with distinct isotope values: (1) mudflats containing benthic microalgae (mean -22.6, SE 0.6 parts per thousand) and (2) seagrass and its associated epiphytic algae (similar values, pooled mean -9.8, 0.5 parts per thousand). Three species of invertebrates were analysed: a palaemonid shrimp, Macrobrachium intermedium, and two polychaete worms, Nephtys australiensis and Australonereis ehlersi. All species had a similar narrow range of isotope values (-9 to -14 parts per thousand), and showed no statistically significant relationship between position along transect and isotope values. Animals were relying on carbon from seagrass meadows whether they were in seagrass or on mudflats hundreds of metres away. Particulate organic matter collected from superficial sediments along the transects had similar values to animals (mean -11.1, SE 1.3 parts per thousand) and also showed no significant relationship with position. The isotope values of these relatively immobile invertebrates and the particulate detritus suggest that carbon moves from subtidal seagrass meadows to mudflats as particulate matter and is assimilated by invertebrates. This assimilation might be direct in the case of the detritivorous worm, A. ehlersi, but must be via invertebrate prey in the case of the carnivorous worm, N. australiensis and the scavenging shrimp, M. intermedium. The extent of movement of carbon among habitats, especially towards shallower habitats, is surprising since in theory, carbon is more likely to move offshore in situations such as the current study where habitats are in relatively open, unprotected waters.

AB  - Throughflow marsh flumes were used to measure total sediment exchanges (TSS) between the marshes and water column of two Louisiana estuaries.  One, the Barataria Basin estuary, is isolated from significant riverine sediment input.  There were significant (p < 0.05) imports of 33.9 to 443 mg TSS m-2 h-1 at the Barataria Basin brackish marsh (BM) site.  The Barataria Basin saltmarsh (SM) site exported TSS in two summer samplings, but significant uptake was measured in April (166 mg m-2 h-1) and November (45 mg m-2 h-1) during a winter frontal passage event.  The other estuary, Fourleague Bay, receives large sediment inputs from the Atchafalaya River, and TSS imports of 22.5 to 118.5 mg m-2 h-1 were measured at the BM site here.  We calculated sediment accumulation from fluxes quantified in marsh flumes using site-specific sedimentological data and flooding regimes at each site.  Water level records from May 1987 to April 1989 showed an extended period of unusually low flooding frequencies.  As a result, calculated accretion rates were low, with monthly rates of 0.02 to 0.11 mm and -0.06 to 0.06 mm at the Barataria BM and SM sites, respectively, and -0.18 to 0.08 mm at the Fourleague Bay marsh flume site.  Actual net sediment deposition, determined by feldspar marker horizon analysis, was 0.7-1.6 mm mo-1 at the Barataria SM and 0.2-1.3 mm mo-1 at the Fourleague Bay BM.  Even the highest caluclated accretion rates, based on flume measurements, were half to one order of magnitude lower than actual measured sediment deposition.  This discrepancy was probably because: 1) most sedimentation occurs during episodic events, such as Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988, which deposited 3.5-15.5 mm of sediment on the Barataria Basin saltmarsh, or 2) most vertical accretion in Louisiana marshes occurs via deposition of in situ organic matter rather than by influx of allochthonous sediment.  Our results affirm the variability of short-term sediment transport and depositional processes, the close coupling of meteorologic forcing and flooding regime to sediment dynamics, and the importance of understanding these interrelated mechanisms in the context of longer term measurements.

AB  - The objective of this study was to apply phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA)-based stable isotope probing to assess the temporal variation of active microorganisms associated with rhizosphere-C flow in a natural wetland. We applied (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling at three different times throughout the vegetation period: spring (April), early summer (June), and early autumn (October). Soil redox potentials (Eh) at 10 cm depth ranged from moderately reduced (October) to oxidized conditions (June). Based on combined PLFA relative abundance and C-13 enrichment results, we suggest that gram-negative bacteria play a main role in rhizodeposit-C uptake in these wetland ecosystems, especially when reduced soil conditions prevail in October. Arbuscular and saprotrophic fungi also take up a significant proportion of the belowground allocated C, though mostly in the summer period. Gram-positive bacteria showed only a minor reliance on rhizodeposit-C throughout the year. It is concluded that rhizodeposit-C-assimilating microbial communities are heterogeneous and temporal variable entities with groups that are capable of adapting differently to seasonally varying environmental conditions.

AB  - At-a-station and bankfull hydraulic geometry analyses of peatland channels at Barrington Tops, New South Wales, Australia, reveal adjustments in self-forming channels in the absence of sediment load. Using Rhodes ternary diagram, comparisons are made with hydraulic geometry data from self-forming channels carrying bedload in alluvial settings elsewhere. Despite constraints on channel depths caused at some locations by the restricted thickness of peat, most stations have cohesive, near-vertical, well-vegetated banks, and width/depth (w/d) ratios of similar to 2 that are optimal for sediment-free flow. Because banks are strong, resist erosion and can stand nearly vertical, and depth is sometimes constrained, adjustments to discharge are accommodated largely by changes in velocity. These findings are consistent with the model of maximum flow efficiency and the overarching least action principle in open channels. The bankfull depth of freely adjusting laterally active channels in clastic alluvium is well known to be related to the thickness of floodplain alluvium and a similar condition appears to apply to these swamps that grow in situ and are formed almost entirely of organic matter. The thickness of peat in these swamps rarely exceeds that required to form a bankfull channel of optimum w/d ratio for the transport of sediment-free water. Swamp vegetation is highly dependent on proximity to the water table. To maintain a swamp-channel and associated floodplain system, the channels must flow with sufficient water much of the time; they not only offer an efficient morphology for flow but do so in a way that enables bankfull conditions to occur many times a year. They also prevent the swamp from growing above a level linked to the depth of the channel. Once the channel attains the most efficient cross section, further growth of the swamp vertically is restricted by enhanced flow velocities and limited flow depths. This means that the volume of peat in such swamps is determined by the hydraulic efficiency of their channels. The development and maintenance of the hydraulic geometry of these swamp channels is biogeomorphic and biohydraulic in nature and yet accords to the same optimising principles that govern the formation of self-adjusting channels and floodplains in clastic alluvium.

AB  - Biogeochemical data from Welwick marsh (Humber Estuary, UK), an actively accreting saltmarsh, provides a decadal-centennial-scale natural analogue for likely future biogeochemical storage effects of managed realignment sites accreting either intertidal muds or saltmarsh. Marsh topographic profiles and progradation history from aerial photographs were combined with Cs-137 and niobium contamination history to establish and verify chronology and sediment mass accumulation. These data, combined with down-core measurements of particulate organic carbon (C-org), organic nitrogen (N-org), particle reactive phosphorus and selected contaminant metal (Zn, Pb, Cu, As and Nb) contents were then used to calculate sediment and chemical storage terms and to quantify changes in these over time. These data are used to help predict likely future biogeochemical storage changes at managed realignment sites in the estuary. The net effect of returning some 26 km(2) of reclaimed land to intertidal environments now (about 25% of the maximum possible realignment storage identified for the estuary) could result in the storage of some 40,000 tonnes a(-1) of sediment which would also bury about 800 tonnes a(-1) of Corg and 40 tonnes a(-1) of Norg, Particulate contaminant P burial would be around 25 tonnes a(-1) along with similar to 6 tonnes a(-1) contaminant Zn, 3 tonnes a(-1) contaminant Pb, and similar to 1 tonnes a(-1) contaminant As and Cu. The study also shows that reclamation activities in the outer estuary since the mid-1700s has prevented, in total, the deposition of about 10 million tonnes of sediment, along with 320,000 tonnes of C-org and 16,000 tonnes of N-org. The study provides a mid-1990s baseline against which future measurements at the site can determine changes in burial fluxes and improvement or deterioration in contaminant metal contents of the sediments. The data are directly relevant for local managed realignment sites but also broadly indicative for sites generally on the European North Sea Coast. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO(2)e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO(2)e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO(2)e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

AB  - Plots of intermediate-height cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) were fertilized with nitrogen, misted with freshwater, given both misting and N, or left untreated. Bacterial responses on standing-decaying leaf blades were measured as changes in epiphytic mass, rates of shedding of bacterial cells into seawater, and rates of net growth on blades. Epiphytic mass rose with time, and it did so 6-fold more sharply for the combination of fertilization and misting than for control. Since the sediment surface would offer higher N and water availability, this may indicate that movement of leaf material to marsh sediments would strongly favor bacterial activity. Net growth on aerially incubated (15 h), wet blades as percentage of standing bacterial mass was unchanging with duration of decay period, but was affected by treatment (about 0 to +5% h(-1) for misted treatments, +15% h(-1) for unmisted treatments). Faster growth on newly wetted, unmisted blades may have been due to release of cells from growth limitation by desiccation. Plot treatment did not affect specific rate of bacterial shedding (about 8% of standing bacterial epiphytic mass during one h of submergence at 4 weeks, and 149% h(-1) at 12 weeks). It may be that during high spring tides, bacterial shedding from standing-decaying blades could provide numbers of new cells in the water column near to or greater than those provided by division of bacterioplanktonic cells.

AB  - This study examined the environmental factors that control the distribution of modern foraminiferal assemblages in the Everglades in order to provide baseline data for a paleoenvironmental study. Total assemblages from the surface 2 cm of 30 sites across the marsh and mangrove environments of south-west Florida were investigated. Eight environmental variables, including average salinity, salinity range, pH, total phosphorus, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, and total organic carbon and total inorganic carbon measured on bulk sediments, as well as the elevation and distance from the coastline were determined for each of the 30 sampling locations.
   In total, 82 species were identified, the majority of which were calcareous. Diversity decreases, dominance increases, and agglutinated taxa increase from the coastline inland. Rotaliina are equally abundant across the intertidal environment, whereas Miliolina are common near the coast and in lagoons or inland lakes. The most important factor control-ling foraminiferal distribution is total organic carbon, followed by total inorganic carbon, distance from coastline, total phosphorus, and salinity. Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca indicate lower salinities (<15 psu). Good indicators for higher salinities are Haplophragmoides wilberti (10-20 psu) and Arenoparrella mexicana (10-20 psu and 28-30 psu). Ammonia spp. prefer salinities >15 psu and Elphidium spp. >20 psu. Ammonia tepida, Helenina anderseni, Trochammina in-flata, and A. mexicana prefer organic-rich sediments. Thus, the benthic foraminifera from Everglades sediments are excel-lent salinity proxies and can be used to determine the history of habitat change in this area as well as to assess past trends in the rate of sea level rise.

AB  - Saltwater incursion carries high concentrations of sea salts, including sulfate, which can alter anaerobic microbial processes and plant community composition of coastal freshwater marshes. We studied these phenomena in a recently restored wetland on the coastal plain of North Carolina. We measured water inundation patterns, porewater chemistry, microbial process rates, plant tissue chemistry and iron plaque on plant roots, and quantified plant community composition across a hydrologic and salinity gradient to understand the potential interactions between saltwater incursion and changes in microbial processes and plant communities. Plant communities showed no obvious response to incursion, but were structured by inundation patterns and plant growth form (for example, graminoid versus forb). Saltwater incursion increased chloride and sulfate concentrations in surface and porewater, and drove resulting spatial patterns in anaerobic microbial metabolism rates. Plots experiencing saltwater incursion had higher sulfate reduction rates and were dominated by graminoid plant species (for example, sedges, rushes, and grasses). Graminoid plant species' roots had greater iron plaque formation than forb and submerged species, indicative that graminoid plant species are supplying more oxygen to the rhizosphere, potentially influencing microbial metabolism. Future studies should focus on how plant and microbial communities may respond to saltwater incursion at different time scales, and on parsing out the influence that plants and microbes have on each other as freshwater wetlands experience sea level rise.

AB  - Five zones along a transect of 180 m were selected for study on the Island of Pai Matos (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Four of the zones are colonised by vascular plants (Spartina SP, Laguncularia LG, Avicennia AV and Rhizophora RH) and were denominated soils, and the other zone, which lacks vegetation, was denominated sediment (SD). The geochemical conditions differed significantly in soils and sediment and also at different depths. The soils were oxic (Eh > 350 mV) or suboxic (Eh: 350-100 mV) at the surface and anoxic (Eh < 100 mV) at depth, whereas in the sediment anoxic conditions prevailed at all depths, but with a lower concentration of sulphides in the pore water and pyrite in the solid fraction. Under these geochemical conditions Fe is retained in the soils, while the Mn tends to be mobilized and lost. The most abundant form of iron oxyhydroxide was lepidocrocite (mean concentration for all sites and depths, 45 +/- 19 mu mol g(-1)), followed by goethite (30 19 mu mol g(-1))and ferrihydrite (19 +/- 11 mu mol g(-1)),with significant differences among the mean concentrations. There was a significant decrease with depth in all the types of Fe oxyhydroxides measured, particularly the poorly crystalline forms. The pyrite fraction was an important component of the free Fe pool (non-silicate Fe) in all soils as well as in the sediment, especially below 20 cm depth (mean concentration for all sites and depths, 60 +/- 54 mu mol CI). Furthermore, the mean concentration of Fe-pyrite for all sites and depths was higher than that obtained for any of the three Fe oxyhydroxides measured. The Fe-AVS was a minor fraction, indicating that the high concentrations of dissolved Fe in the soils in the upper area of the transect result from the oxidation of Fe sulphides during low tide. Mossbauer spectroscopy also revealed that most of the Fe (III) was associated with silicates, in this case nontronite. The presence of crystals of pyrite associated with phyllosilicates in samples from the upper layer of the soils may indicate that pyritization of this form of Fe(III) is more rapid than usually reported for ocean bed sediments. The sequential extraction of Mn did not reveal any clearly dominant fraction, with the Mn-carbonate fraction being the most prevalent, followed by exchangeable Mn and oxides of Mn, whereas pyrite-Mn and Mn associated with crystalline Fe-oxides were present at significantly lower concentrations. The high concentration of dissolved Mn found in the soils in the lower part of the transect is consistent with the fact that the solubility is determined by the carbonate fraction. Unlike for Fe, in the soils in the higher zone, which are subject to intense drainage during low tide, there was loss of Mn, as reflected by the concentration of total Mn. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon burial is increasingly valued as a service provided by threatened vegetated coastal habitats. Similarly, shellfish reefs contain significant pools of carbon and are globally endangered, yet considerable uncertainty remains regarding shellfish reefs' role as sources (+) or sinks (2) of atmospheric CO2. While CO2 release is a by-product of carbonate shell production (then burial), shellfish also facilitate atmospheric-CO2 drawdown via filtration and rapid biodeposition of carbon-fixing primary producers. We provide a framework to account for the dual burial of inorganic and organic carbon, and demonstrate that decade-old experimental reefs on intertidal sandflats were net sources of CO2 (7.1 +/- 1.2 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1) (mu + s.e.)) resulting from predominantly carbonate deposition, whereas shallow subtidal reefs (-1.0 +/- 0.4 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) and saltmarsh-fringing reefs (-1.3 +/- 0.4 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)) were dominated by organic-carbon-rich sediments and functioned as net carbon sinks (on par with vegetated coastal habitats). These landscape-level differences reflect gradients in shellfish growth, survivorship and shell bioerosion. Notably, down-core carbon concentrations in 100- to 4000-year-old reefs mirrored experimental-reef data, suggesting our results are relevant over centennial to millennial scales, although we note that these natural reefs appeared to function as slight carbon sources (0.5 +/- 0.3 MgC ha(-1) yr(-1)). Globally, the historical mining of the top metre of shellfish reefs may have reintroduced more than 400 000 000 Mg of organic carbon into estuaries. Importantly, reef formation and destruction do not have reciprocal, counterbalancing impacts on atmospheric CO2 since excavated organic material may be remineralized while shell may experience continued preservation through reburial. Thus, protection of existing reefs could be considered as one component of climate mitigation programmes focused on the coastal zone.

AB  - The creation and restoration of wetlands is widely seen as a critical tool for replacing ecosystem functions lost by historic wetland destruction. However, studies have shown that these wetlands often take hundreds of years to achieve the functions for which they are restored. We used controlled field-scale manipulations in four recently restored depressional freshwater wetlands in western New York to investigate the impact of organic amendments of differing lability on the soil and vegetative development during the first 3 yr. Results showed that the addition of soil amendments to wetland plots stimulates development of key soil properties that are critical for wetland functioning. In particular, initial increases in soil C and decreases in bulk density in topsoil and biochar amended plots were still present 3 yr after restoration. Plant biomass recovered quickly and had reached levels of comparable natural wetlands within 2 yr, irrespective of amendments. Amendments did not influence plant diversity. Site differences, however, did influence plant diversity and different sites hosted different numbers and types of species. Two years after restoration, both desirable native wetland species and undesirable weedy species had colonized each site. Results of this research reveal that organic amendments can improve key soil properties critical for wetland functioning. The strength of treatment effects and the development of the plant community, however, are highly influenced by initial site conditions. These results confirm the importance of focusing on both hastening soil development via amendments and careful site selection in restoration design.

AB  - The rhizosphere sediments of seagrasses are generally a site of intense nitrogen fixation activity and this can provide a significant source of "new" nitrogen Tur the growth of the plants. In this paper, I review the data concerning nitrogen fixation in scagrass ecosystems, the transfer of the fixed nitrogen from the bacteria to the plants and its contribution to the overall productivity of seagrasses in different climatic zones. The relationship between the plants and diazotrophic heterotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere is discussed, particularly focusing on the potentially important role of nitrogen-fixing, sulphate-reducing bacteria. The regulation of nitrogen fixation rates in the rhizosphere by photosynthetically driven oxygen and fixed carbon release Ly the plant roots and rhizomes, and the availability of ammonium in the porewater, is assessed. Finally, the hypothesis that a mutualistic or symbiotic association exists between the seagrasses and heterotrophic nitrogen fixers in the rhizosphere, based on the mutual exchange of fixed carbon and nitrogen, is discussed.

AB  - Initial rates (30-60 days) and C:N stoichiometry of decomposition were examined in an organic-poor sediment (0.5% LOI) amended with fresh and dried yeast (Y) and Ruppia maritima (R) detritus by the use of ''open system'' core incubations and ''closed system'' jar incubations. High organic additions (0.5% dw) inhibited anaerobic carbon mineralization (i.e. sulfate reduction) and stimulated DOC production and nitrogen mineralization 3(R) to 15(Y) times (i.e. hydrolysis and fermentation). This indicated that carbon and nitrogen mineralization in the highly amended anaerobic sediments were uncoupled. Low organic additions (0.08% dw), on the other hand, stimulated both carbon and nitrogen mineralization by 1-2(R) and 3(Y) times. The comparison of reaction rates involving CO2, SO42- and NH4+ estimated from (1) modeling of porewater profiles (''open system''), (2) temporal changes in jars (''closed system'') and (3) sediment-water fluxes, documented equal applicability of these techniques in non-bioturbated sediment (except for NH4+ in (3) where nitrification interfered). The modeling approach (1) also suggested that the TCO2 deficiency observed in the uppermost oxidized zone of the sediment can be explained by rapid CO2 fixation by e.g. sulfide oxidizing chemoautotrophs. Although the C:N stoichiometry of inorganic decomposition products based on estimate (1) and (2) generally agreed well, it was found crucial to include dissolved organic pools (i.e. DOG) in estimates from highly amended anaerobic sediments due to the uncoupling of carbon and nitrogen mineralization. The stoichiometry of inorganic mineralization products can only be used to describe particulate organic matter decay in sediments where the concentration of DOC is negligible. C:N ratios obtained in the present study indicated that the major compounds being degraded in unamended (with an indigenous diatom pool) and yeast amended sediment were proteins (C:N = 4-5), whereas in Ruppia amended sediment carbohydrates were more important (C:N = 6-9).

AB  - Sediment samples from two locations in the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) were collected during periods of maximum and minimum temperatures for two years. Both sites were rich in carbonate material and inhabited by a diverse benthic infaunal community. However, Site F exhibited a deeper dwelling faunal community, higher content of carbonate minerals, and larger grained sediments than at site MA, which was closer to shore. Depth profiles of sulfate reduction and potential rates of iron and manganese reduction were determined together with measurements of pore water and solid phase chemistry. Bottom waters at all sites were nearly saturated with oxygen for all of the dates sampled except for September 1993 when bottom waters at site F were less than 50% saturated. Sulfate reduction rates were as high as 400 nmol ml(-1) day(-1) during late summer and fall when temperatures were >20 degrees C, while rates during March (similar to 8 degrees C) were <30 nmol ml(-1) day(-1). Potential rates of iron reduction, as determined by the accumulation of both dissolved and acid-soluble reduced iron, were high in surficial sediments at each site except at site F when bottom waters were partially depleted in oxygen. In the latter instance, sulfate reduction overwhelmed metal reduction. Although the portion of metal reduction due directly to enzymatic use by bacteria was not determined, the potential rate data suggested that Fe and perhaps Mn reduction were significant components of anaerobic carbon degradation in these sediments during much of the year. Both sites appeared to support active metal-reducing bacterial communities. However, occasional depletion of oxygen in bottom waters appeared to cause a decrease in irrigation/reworking activity by infauna which depressed redox cycling of elements enhancing the importance of sulfate reduction. A shift from metal reduction to sulfate reduction potentially exacerbates toxic effects of oxygen depletion on fauna by increasing the accumulation of toxic sulfide.

AB  - The majority of sediment dweller foraminifera are deposit feeders. They use their pseudopodia to gather sediment with associated algae, organic detritus and bacteria. Uptake of bacteria by foraminifera have been observed but rarely quantified. We measured uptake of bacteria by the common foraminifera Ammonia tepida using N-15 pre-enriched bacteria as tracers. In intertidal flats, seasonal, tidal and circadian cycles induce strong variations in environmental parameters. Grazing experiments were performed in order to measure effects of abiotic (temperature, salinity and irradiance) and biotic (bacterial and algal abundances) factors on uptake rates of bacteria. In mean conditions, A. tepida grazed 78 pgC ind(-1) h(-1) during the first eight hours of incubation, after which this uptake rate decreased. Uptake of bacteria was optimal at 30 degrees C, decreased with salinity and was unaffected by light. Above 7 x 108 bacteria ml wt sed(-1), uptake of bacteria remained unchanged when bacterial abundance increased. Algal abundance strongly affected algal uptake but did not affect uptake of bacteria. As uptake of bacteria represented 8 to 19% of microbes (algae plus bacteria) uptake, Ammonia seemed to be mainly dependant on algal resource. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A core collected in the Guaymas Basin contained an organic-poor, Mn oxide-rich and (relatively) Fe oxide-rich turbidite layer that affected the distribution of Fe, Mn, C, S and trace metals. Results indicate that sediments not influenced by the turbidite layer achieved a 100% degree of pyritization and, by extension, that pyrite production is Fe-limited in these sediments. In contrast, the mud slide layer apparently supplied enough reactive Fe to transfer essentially 98% of the total S present at the base of the turbidite (17-19 cm) to the pyrite reservoir. C/S ratios showed rapid decreases with depth, from a high of 38 close to the sediment-water interface, to minimum values of 2.8 at the lower limit of the turbidite layer, a ratio equal to the average C/S value of normal marine modern sediments, where concentrations of organic C and pyrite supposedly have attained quasi-steady values. A significant part of the reactive Mn was associated with carbonates (41 +/- 12%) and, to a much lower degree, with pyrite (2.7 +/- 1.2%). The turbidite layer is currently showing a depletion of Mn relative to the host sediment. It is possible that Mn, a major metal constituent in these sediments, was initially present in high concentrations in the mud slide, but was eventually mobilized and transferred either to the water column or to the sediments immediately below the turbidite layer. Metals associated with this element probably followed the same path, affecting their incorporation into pyrite. The turbidite layer apparently affected the distribution of most of the trace metals associated with pyrite, except maybe Cd, Pb and, to a certain, extent Cr. However, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni and Co were all found to be highly pyritized (> 80%) in the sediments of the Guaymas Basin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The uptake and release of materials by intertidal mussel beds were directly measured in two cultivated Dutch estuaries. Generally, chlorophyll a, seston, and particulate organic carbon were taken up, while ammonium, orthophosphate, and silicate were released. The observed rates were higher than values computed from organismic observations and similar to those observed for intertidal oyster reefs in South Carolina. Specific estuarine material turnover rates varied from 1 week to 38 weeks when calculated with mussel bed fluxes. The fastest turnover rates were for chlorophyll a and ammonium. These results support the idea that dense assemblages of bivalves are major components in the recycling of nutrients in estuaries.

AB  - The Arcachon lagoon is a 156 km(2) temperate mesotidal lagoon dominated by tidal flats (66% of the surface area). The methane (CH4) sources, sinks and fluxes were estimated from water and pore water concentrations, from chamber flux measurements at the sediment air (low tide), sediment-water and water-air (high tide) interfaces, and from potential oxidation and production rate measurements in sediments. CH4 concentrations in waters were maximal (500-1000 nmol l(-1)) in river waters and in tidal creeks at low tide, and minimal in the lagoon at high tide (<50 nmol l(-1)). The major CH4 sources are continental waters and the tidal pumping of sediment pore waters at low tide. Methanogenesis occurred in the tidal flat sediments, in which pore water concentrations were relatively high (2.5-8.0 mu mol l(-1)) Nevertheless, the sediment was a minor CH4 source for the water column and the atmosphere because of a high degree of anaerobic and aerobic CH4 oxidation in sediments. Atmospheric CH4 fluxes at high and low tide were low compared to freshwater wetlands. Temperate tidal lagoons appear to be very minor contributor of CH4 to global atmosphere and to open ocean.

AB  - Short-term variability in benthic community primary production was studied during the course of emersion on a study site located in the Bay of Somme (eastern English Channel, France). Primary production was estimated at the community level through in situ measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes (infra-red analysis) in benthic chambers. Throughout the emersion period, gross community production (GCP) exhibited strong variations that were strongly correlated with natural variations in light. Light response curves explained the variations in GCP during the greater part of the emersion period, and vertical migrations of the microphytobenthos were suggested to explain the remaining variations (i.e. just before or just after immersion of the study site). A time lag was observed between the start of emersion and the maximum GCP, which was positively correlated with the time lag between emersion and local noon. The introduction of this time lag within the annual budget calculation enhanced production variability at a 2 wk time scale (i.e. tidal cycle), but light variability at the small time scale (i.e. cloudiness) remained the major factor inducing production variability. Results highlighted that omitting the time lag between emersion time and the maximum GCP within annual budget calculations led to large overestimations of annual GCP, since the annual budget for the study site was recalculated as being 67 g C m(-2) yr(-1) compared to 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1) when the short-term variability was not taken into account.

AB  - The global phenomenon of mangrove encroachment into saltmarshes has been observed across five continents. It has been proposed that this encroachment is driven in part by rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity in saltmarshes resulting from rising sea levels enhancing the establishment success of mangrove seedlings. However, this theory is yet to be empirically tested at the community-level. In this study, we examined the effect of CO2 and salinity on seedling growth of two mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina, grown individually and in a model saltmarsh community in a glasshouse experiment. We found that the shoot (210%) and root (91%) biomass of the saltmarsh species was significantly greater under elevated CO2. As a result, both mangrove species experienced a stronger competitive effect from the saltmarsh species under elevated CO2. Nevertheless, A. marina seedlings produced on average 48% more biomass under elevated CO2 when grown in competition with the saltmarsh species. The seedlings tended to allocate this additional biomass to growing taller suggesting they were light limited. In contrast, A. corniculatum growth did not significantly differ between CO2 treatments. However, it had on average 36% greater growth under seawater salinity compared to hypersaline conditions. Avicennia marina seedlings were not affected by salinity. From these results, we suggest that although CO2 and salinity are not universal drivers determining saltmarsh-mangrove boundaries, it is likely that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity associated with sea level rise will enhance the establishment success of mangrove seedlings in saltmarshes, which may facilitate mangrove encroachment in the future.

AB  - Tidal regime is recognized as a vital hydrological process in the restructuring of saltmarsh vegetation communities, resulting in differing edaphic conditions and ecosystem functions. Ample studies have focused on the context-dependent effects of tidal disturbance on saltmarsh vegetation worldwide, particularly trait-based responses to physical factors; however, to our knowledge, there are few insights into the edaphic conditions and responses of saltmarsh plants as well as plant-soil systems to tidal disturbance gradients in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), a temperate estuary in northern China. Here, we conducted field surveys and experimental fieldwork at four distinct sites that varied with tidal regime. Site-specific effects of tidal disturbance on the annual saltmarsh foundation plant Suaeda salsa, as well as their edaphic surroundings, were analyzed. Our results showed that trait-based responses largely explained the tidal disturbance impacts on S. salsa; moreover, the edaphic environment differed significantly among sites. We found that flooding frequency had a significantly negative relation to S. salsa total biomass, which consisted of above- and belowground biomass, and a significantly positive relation to height. In general, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus differed among sites, and these differences changed with the soil layers. In addition, there were some correlations between the soil environment and plant traits. Total organic carbon was linearly positively linked to the biomass of S. salsa at each soil depth. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of the soil had a low correlation with that of the belowground biomass of S. salsa but had a significant correlation with that of the aboveground biomass of S. salsa. Our study suggests that spatial patterns of S. salsa and edaphic conditions in the YRD vary with tidal regime, therefore providing a basis for the context-dependent conservation and restoration of coastal saltmarsh ecosystems, especially in areas with irregular, semidiumal tides. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of potential interactive effects between plant traits and tidal disturbances in regulating biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon sequestration, in coastal saltmarsh systems.

AB  - Biochar has the potential to improve soil properties and increase plant productivity. However, due to the different types of soil, plants, and environmental factors, the impact of biochar is likely to vary. We explored the impacts of biochar prepared from an invasive plant Spartina alterniflora on plant performance and soil characteristics in a simulated coastal wetland ecosystem. We investigated the impact of three application ratios (control, 1%, and 5%; weight ratio) of biochar on the germination and growth of a native plant Suaeda salsa, the nutrient content and microbial community characteristics of the rhizosphere soil under three flooding treatments (no flooding, episodic flooding, and continuous flooding). Biochar application had no impact on seed germination of S. salsa, but promoted its seedling growth (biomass, height, root length) and nitrogen content. Biochar application also enhanced soil nutrient content and affected soil microbial community characteristics. Seed germination and seedling growth of S. salsa were sensitive to flooding and were the best under episodic flooding. Notably, flooding inhibited the impact of biochar on S. salsa and rhizosphere soil. In conclusion, biochar can positively affect the growth of S. salsa and improve the quality of rhizosphere soil, especially under no flooding. Our findings highlight the possibility of applying biochar for the restoration of S. salsa in coastal wetlands. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Complete porewater profiles from two peat bogs in the Jura Mountains were analysed for major and trace inorganic anions and cations. At La Tourbiere des Genevez (TGe) and Etang de la Gruere (EGr), peat formation began approximately 5,000 and 10,000 years BP, respectively. The maximum depths of peat accumulation are 140 cm (TGe) and 650 cm (EGr); previous geochemical studies showed that the ombrogenic sections of the bogs extend to depths of approximately 20 cm (TGe) and 250 cm (EGr). Water samples were obtained in situ diffusion equilibrium samplers (peepers), which allow filtered (0.2 mu m) porewaters to be obtained while preventing degassing and oxidation. These samplers were found to be well suited to bog porewaters and allowed volatile (dissolved CO2, acetate) and redox-sensitive species (HS-, Fe2+) to be quantified without further sample preparation or treatment. Aqueous species concentrations were determined immediately afterwards using ion chromatography with either conductivity (acetate, HCO3-, Cl-, Br-, NO3-, HPO42-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), amperometry (HS-), or absorbance detection (Fe(III) and Fe(II)). The comprehensive analyses of anions and cations allowed humic substances to be calculated by the difference in electrical charge balance (i.e., the anion deficit).
   Concentrations of total dissolved CO2 (2-12 mM) showed that carbonate equilibria play a significant role in the acid-base chemistry throughout the profiles. In near surface, ombrogenic porewaters with pH around 4, however, protons (approx. 160 mu eq/L) are contributed mainly by the dissociation of humic substances (2-7 mM DOC). In the deepest, minerogenic layers H2CO3 is the predominant acid at both sites. At these depths, carbonate alkalinity (up to 3 meq/L at EGr, up to 8 meq/L at TGe) arises from reaction of the pore fluids with mineral matter in the underlying sediments. In the transition zone between the ombrogenic and minerogenic extremes, organic and inorganic acids are equal in importance.
   Unidentified organic S species accounted for 90-99% of total dissolved sulfur (S-T) in the porewaters at TGe, with SO42- and HS- the dominant inorganic species; S species with intermediate oxidation states such as SO32- and S2OS32- were always less than the detection limit of approximately 0.4 mu M. At TGe the sulfate concentrations exceeded those of sulfide, with 1.25 and 0.25 mu M, respectively, being typical. At EGr, S-T and SO42- were comparable to the waters at TGe, but HS- at EGr was always less than the detection limit of 0.15 mu M At both sites dissimilatory sulfate reduction is limited by the low concentrations of sulfate supplied to the bog surfaces (i.e., atmospheric deposition only), and the uptake of sulfate and its conversion to organic S compounds by the living plants.
   Despite the anoxic condition of the waters, the ratio of Fe(III)(T) to Fe(II)(T) was always high: at EGr this ratio was generally 1:1, and even in the sulfidic waters at TGe the ratio was 1:3. PHREEQE was used to calculate the effect of complex-forming organic ligands on {Fe3+} and {Fe2+} in these porewaters. The relatively high ratios of Fe(III)(T) compared to Fe(II)(T) can be explained in terms of the much greater thermodynamic stability of the organic complexes of Fe3+ compared to those of Fe2+.

AB  - Common reed (Phragmites australis) is a prominent species in the upstream part of the eutrophic Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). From 1996 till 1998, seasonal growth dynamics of the species were studied in two monospecific stands subjected to different salinity regimes (seasonal means 1.6 and 13.3 PSU, respectively). We addressed the following questions: how are these reed vegetations affected by meteorological conditions and by the growth site, what are the important growth processes and what is the fate of the annually fixed carbon. A mathematical model was developed and calibrated using the data from the oligohaline site. Subsequent application of the model to the mesohaline stand required adaptation of parameters relating to the partitioning of resources and timing of growth initiation only. At their peak, the aboveground biomass was 587-1678 g DW m(-2) at the 13.3 PSU site and 1116-2179 g DW m(-2) (1.6 PSU); more than 60% of the biomass was located underground. In 1996, biomasses were 2-3 times lower than in the other 2 years, caused by a retarded growth initiation. Probably due to a lower temperature in early 1996, rhizome bud burst occurred more than 1 month later compared to the other years. In addition, growth initiation was several weeks later in the mesohaline site. This appeared mainly responsible for the large difference in maximal aboveground biomass between both stations. Architecture of the plants was also affected, with a higher shoot density (about 50% more shoots), better-developed root system (15% of total belowground biomass compared to 5%) and more, but smaller leaves at the higher salinity site. Notwithstanding large differences in aboveground biomass, annual growth was similar at both stations (154 and 132 mol C m(-2) per year at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively). Primary production accounted for about 80% of all growth processes, rhizome remobilization for almost 20%, translocation of mass before sloughing of leaves accounting about 3%. Within a year, some 44% (oligohaline) and 36% (mesohaline) of new assimilates produced by photosynthesis accumulated as dead litter. The other part was respired by the plant itself, either to provide the energy for growth (23%) or maintenance costs (33-41% at the oligo- and mesohaline station, respectively). Calculated annual turnover rates of aboveground biomass, rhizomes and roots were 100, 62 and 73%, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the intertidal seagrass beds of Zostera noltii of Mira estuary (SW, Portugal) the harvesting practices are frequent. The traditional bivalve harvesting not only affects the target species as the remaining biological assemblages. The main aim of this study was to assess the disturbance caused by sediment digging in the recovery of the seagrass beds habitat, through an experimental fieldwork. The responses of the seagrass plant condition, the sediment microbial activity and the nematode assemblages were investigated after the digging activity in seagrass beds. A total of four experimental plots were randomly demarcated in situ, two plots were subjected to the disturbance - "Digging" - while other two were "Control"; the sampling occurred in five occasions, from May to October: T-0-before digging; T-1-14 days after digging; T-2-45 days; T-3 -75 days; and T-4-175 days. The environmental variables measured in the sediment and the photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) of the Z noltii plants in each plot and sampling occasion registered similar values, throughout the experiment. The extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) clearly presented a temporal pattern, although no significant differences were obtained between digging and control plots. Nematode assemblages registered high densities, revealing the absence of the digging effect: control plots maintained similar density and diversity throughout the experiment, while the density and diversity between digging plots was significantly different at T-0 and T-4 ; the trophic composition was similar for both control and digging plots, characterized mainly by non-selective deposit feeders (1B) and epigrowth feeders (2A).Organic matter, nitrate and mean grain size explain a significant amount of the variation in the nematode genera composition. This study demonstrated the capacity of the seagrass habitat to recover under low intensity physical disturbance associated to harvesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the effects of food limitation, in the form of reduced microalgae, on the recolonization of benthic macrofauna into intertidal saltmarsh-pond mesocosms. Eight tanks (1.4 m diameter) were dug into the intertidal Spartina alterniflora zone of a New Jersey saltmarsh, filled with a layer of defaunated mud, and allowed to recolonize naturally. Shading over 4 of the ponds reduced the light reaching the pond bottoms by 92% and the standing stocks of benthic chlorophyll by 27%. Mean density of the total macrobenthic fauna was 62% lower in shaded ponds relative to controls, This condition persisted over the 2 mo study and showed little change in magnitude during the experiment, suggesting a lower 'carrying capacity' in the shaded habitat instead of a transient effect. Shading caused little change in community composition and had no effect on Shannon's index of diversity. Of the 5 most abundant taxa, midge larvae (Chironomus sp,) and the polychaetes Laeonereis culveri and Hobsonia florida densities were significantly lower in shaded ponds. All 3 are known to feed on benthic microalgae. The other 2 dominants, hydrobiid snails and the oligochaete Paranais litoralis, were not significantly affected by shading. Because shading reduced dissolved oxygen levels as well as benthic microalgae, half-way through the experiment continuous aeration was started in 2 of the shaded and 2 of the unshaded ponds in order to maintain high oxygen levels. Oxygenation had no effect on total macrofaunal density, the density of any individual taxon, or species diversity. Results of this manipulative field experiment implicate microalgae as a limiting resource of this macrofaunal community.

AB  - Knowledge on the distribution of nitrogen (N) pools, processes, and fluxes along hydrological gradients provides a comprehensive perspective to understand the underlying causal mechanisms in intertidal flats, and thus improve predictions and climate adaptation strategies. We used a space-for-time substitution method to quantify N pools, processes, and fluxes along a hydrological gradient. Further, we linked N pools and processes and investigated not only surface but also subsurface sediments. Our results showed a gradual decrease in total N (TN) and mineralization rates (PNmin), but an increase in potential rates of nitrification (PNR) and denitrification (PDNR) under an elevated hydrological gradient, except for TN and PNmin in the subsurface sediment, which accumulated on the interaction zone between the high and middle tidal flats. Most sedimentary ammonium N (NH4+) and nitrate N (NO3-) concentrations were similar; however, NH4+ accumulated on the subsurface of the middle tidal flat. NO3- fluxes (from -0.54 to -0.35 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) were uptake fluxes in the intertidal flats, but NH4+ fluxes (-2.48-3.54 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) changed from uptake to efflux in the seaward direction. Structural equation modeling of the effects of inundation frequency, underground biomass, total carbon (TC), electrical conductivity (EC), and clay proportion on the N processes revealed that these accounted for 67%, 82%, and 17% of the variance of PDNR, PNmin, and PNR, respectively. Inundation frequency, underground biomass, TC, EC, and PNmin effects on N pools accounted for 53%, 69%, and 98% of the variance of NH4+, NO3-, and TN, respectively. This suggests that future sea level rise may decrease N storage due to increase in coupled nitrification-denitrification and decrease in N mineralization, and the NH4+ flux may change from sink to source in intertidal ecosystems.

AB  - Assessing the diverse communities of methanogenic Archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is important to understand methane (CH4) production in wetland ecosystems. However, the vertical distribution of composition and diversity, and the effects of environmental factors on the methanogen and SRB communities in the sediments of subtropical estuarine brackish marshes have been poorly characterized. To assess the effects' of variable environmental conditions on methanogenic and SRB communities in marshes, we studied three brackish marsh zones dominated by Phragmites australis, Cyperus malaccensis and Spartina alterniflora, respectively, in the Min River estuary, southeastern China. Methanogens of the Methanomicrobiales order was the dominant group at sediment depths of 0-30 cm, which indicated that the main pathway of methane production was H-2/CO2 in this zone. In general, methanogens of the genus Methanoregula were dominant in the three marsh zones. For SRB, Desulfobacterales was the dominant group, and Desulfobacterium and Desulfosarcina were the predominant genera at the depth of 0-30 cm. The community composition of methanogens and SRB changed with vegetation type and soil depth. Compared with SRB, vegetation type demonstrated a stronger influence on the community composition of methanogens. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis further revealed that the main factors affecting the methanogens community composition were EC (electric conductivity) and pH, and the main factors affecting SRB community composition were pH, SOC and TN, suggesting that pH is a common factor influencing the community compositions of both methanogen and SRB in the sediments of brackish marshes.

AB  - Major elements and trace metals were analyzed in four sediment cores recovered along a transect in the Mandovi estuary for their distribution, provenance and early diagenesis. The sediments were clayey silts in cores from the upper/lower estuary and sand-dominated in cores from the middle estuary/bay. Organic carbon (OC) content varied from 0.5 to 4%, with higher values in fine-grained sediments. The mean Fe and Mn contents of sediments from the upper/middle estuary were 3-5 times and 8-13 times, respectively higher than the reference sediment (RS) from the same estuary. The mean Fe and Mn contents of sediments from the lower estuary/bay were close to the RS. Strong inter-metal correlation among Ti, V, Cr and Zr in all the cores indicated their contribution from a common source, probably the laterites from hinterland. Trace metals were more enriched in fine-grained sediments than in sand dominated sediments. Early diagenetic control on the redistribution of metal is evident in core sediments from the middle estuary to Bay. The distribution of Mo, U and Pb followed that of Fe and Mn in the upper estuary and OC in the lower estuary/bay. Our results indicated strong anthropogenic contribution of metals from ore deposits in the upper/middle estuary. The Mn and Cr contents of sediment in the upper/middle estuary and Fe in the middle estuary were highly enriched suggestive of 'significant pollution signal'. More trace metals from the middle estuary were moderately enriched. Speciation studies showed Mn and Pb occurred abundantly in non-residual phases. High Mn content and its high percentage in exchangeable and reductive phases indicate that it was susceptible to be mobilized. However, Fe, Cu and Ni occurred abundantly in residual phases and less percentage of them were expected to be bio-available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Aedes vigilax is one of the most significant arbovirus vector and pest species in Australia's coastal regions. Occurring in multiple countries, this mosquito species occurs as a species complex which has been separated into three clades with two detected in Australia. Until recently, Ae. vigilax has largely been absent from Victoria, only occasionally caught over the years, with no reported detections from 2010 to 2016. Complicating the detection of Ae. vigilax is the shared sympatric distribution to the morphologically similar Ae. camptorhynchus, which can exceed 10,000 mosquitoes in a single trap night in Victoria. Currently, there are no molecular assays available for the detection of Ae. vigilax. We aim to develop a quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the detection of Ae. vigilax, with the specificity and sensitivity of this assay assessed as well as a method to process whole mosquito traps.
   Methods: Trapping was performed during the 2017-2020 mosquito season in Victoria in two coastal areas across these 3 consecutive years. A qPCR assay was designed to allow rapid identification of Ae. vigilax as well as a whole mosquito trap homogenizing and processing methodology. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine which clade Ae. vigilax from Victoria was closest to.
   Results: Aedes vigilax was successfully detected each year across two coastal areas of Victoria, confirming the presence of this species. The qPCR assay was proven to be sensitive and specific to Ae. vigilax, with trap sizes up to 1000 mosquitoes showing no inhibition in detection sensitivity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ae. vigilax from Victoria is associated with clade III, showing high sequence similarity to those previously collected in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.
   Conclusions: Aedes vigilax is a significant vector species that shares an overlapping distribution to the morphologically similar Ae. camptorhynchus, making detection difficult. Here, we have outlined the implementation of a specific and sensitive molecular screening assay coupled with a method to process samples for detection of Ae. vigilax in collections with large numbers of non-target species.

AB  - Estuaries are sites of port, industrial, urban and recreational development and also important to many forms of animal life. They often form sinks for sediment and thus for contaminants associated with the sediment which arise from anthropogenic activities in their hinterland and along their shores. These contaminants can adversely affect estuarine ecosystems and are the subject of international agreements on environmental protection. For both of these reasons, it is important to increase our knowledge of the distribution, concentration, controlling influences on, and impacts of, estuarine contamination. Evidence from around the world shows that although estuaries are sinks for contaminants from the terrestrial environment, there is significant transport of marine material up-estuary as bed load sediment whilst fine-grained terrestrial material may be transported seawards in suspension. Major movement of contaminants from estuaries onto the continental shelf probably occurs only during floods and storms and, in general, the impact on shelf seas is relatively minor and confined to the coastal zone. The chief exception to this rule is in the Far East where sediment from major Chinese rivers may be dispersed up to 300 kin across the shelf. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Sedimentary plant waxes and their hydrogen and carbon (delta H-2 and delta C-13) isotopes are important proxies for past hydrologic and vegetation change. However sedimentary waxes accumulate from diverse sources, integrating uncertainties from: (i) variable isotope fractionation among plant species, and (ii) unresolved processes controlling the transport of waxes from plants to sediments. We address these uncertainties by comparing the molecular and isotopic composition of n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids in recent bog sediments with all major plant species growing in the catchment of Browns Lake Bog (BLB) in Ohio, USA. There are two distinct plant assemblages at BLB, including a forest dominated by trees and a bog shoreline composed of shrubs, woody groundcover, herbs and graminoids. n-Alkane concentrations in trees were 10-300 times higher than in shoreline plants, while n-alkanoic acid concentrations were generally lower and comparable across all species. The overall range of wax delta H-2 values among individual plants (77 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 84 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) was likely driven by interspecies differences in biosynthetic delta H-2 fractionation as well as source water differences between forest and shoreline plants. A considerably smaller range of delta H-2(wax) values in the bog sediments (9 parts per thousand for n-C-29 alkane and 11 parts per thousand for n-C-28 alkanoic acid) suggests that sediments are either biased toward specific plants, or that signal averaging processes during or after deposition are constant. The combined delta H-2 and delta C-13 signatures of plant sources and sediments indicate a sediment bias mainly toward trees, with contributions from woody shrubs and groundcover growing in the bog shoreline. Within trees and woody shrubs, we observed delta H-2(wax)-delta C-13(wax) relationships of opposite sign for n-C-29 alkane and n-C-28 alkanoic acid, which we speculate may reflect contrasting seasonal timing of synthesis and plant metabolic status between compound classes. The net apparent delta H-2 fractionation between precipitation and wax (epsilon(app)) was approximately 30 parts per thousand larger for n-alkanes (-133 parts per thousand) than for n-alkanoic acids (-103 parts per thousand), both at the plant level and in sediments. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of sediments in a hydrologically closed basin to woody plants growing in the associated catchment and can guide epsilon(app) estimates for sedimentary records from similar depositional settings.

AB  - Solid and colloidal iron oxides are commonly involved in early diagenesis. More readily available soluble Fe(III) should accelerate the cycling of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) in sediments. Experiments with synthetic solutions (Taillefert et al. 2000) showed that soluble Fe(III) (i.e., < 50 nm diameter) reacts at a mercury voltammetric electrode at circumneutral pH if it is complexed by an organic ligand. The reactivity of soluble organic-Fe(III) with sulfide is greatly increased compared to its solid equivalent (e.g., amorphous hydrous iron oxides or goethite). We report here data from two different creeks of the Hackensack Meadowlands District (New Jersey) collected with solid state Au/Hg voltammetric microelectrodes and other conventional techniques, which confirm the existence of soluble organic-Fe(III) in sediments and its interaction with sulfide. Chemical profiles in these two anoxic sediments show the interaction between iron and sulfur during early diagenesis. Soluble organic-Fe (III) and Fe (II) are dominant in a creek where sulfide is negligible. This dominance suggests that the reductive dissolution of iron oxides goes through the dissolution of solid Fe(III), then reduction to Fe(II), or that soluble organic-Fe(III) is formed by chemical or microbial oxidation of organic-Fe(II) complexes. In a creek sediment where sulfide occurs in significant. concentration, the reductive dissolution of Fe(III) is followed by formation of FeS(aq), which further precipitates. Dissolved sulfide may influence the fate of soluble organic-Fe(III), but the pH may be the key variable behind this process. The high reactivity of soluble organic-Fe(III) and its mobility may result in the shifting of local reactions, at depths where other electron acceptors are used. These data also suggest that estuarine and coastal sediments may not always be at steady state.

AB  - Rates of sea level rise associated with climate change are predicted to increase in the future, potentially altering ecosystems at all ecological levels. Sea level rise can increase the extent of brackish water intrusion into freshwater ecosystems, which in turn can affect the structure and function of resident microbial communities. In this study, we performed a year-long mesocosm experiment using intact tidal freshwater marsh sediment cores to examine the effect of a 5-part per thousand (ppt) salinity increase on the diversity and community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. We used a clone library approach to examine the dsrA gene, which encodes an important catalytic enzyme in sulfate reduction. Our results indicate that tidal freshwater marshes contain extremely diverse communities of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Members of these communities were, on average, only 71 % similar to known cultured sulfate reducers and 81 % similar to previously sequenced environmental clones. Salinity and associated increases in sulfate availability did not significantly affect the diversity or community composition of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes. However, carbon quality and quantity, which correlated with depth, were found to be the strongest drivers of sulfate-reducing community structure. Our study demonstrates that the sulfate-reducing community in tidal freshwater marsh sediments appears resistant to increased salinity in the face of sea level rise. Additionally, the microorganisms that comprise this sulfate-reducing community appear to be unique to tidal freshwater marsh sediments and may represent novel lineages of previously undescribed sulfate reducers.

AB  - A comparative study between waterlogged and reflooded intertidal sediments was undertaken in March and June 1999 through statistical analysis of selected sediment parameters (biota, salinity, O-2, Eh), pool sizes and benthic fluxes of nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-) and nitrification rates. In March samples. absence of polychaetes and oligochaetes from upper sediment horizons were due to erosional events sweeping away surface sediments. Presence of richer annelid assemblages in June samples indicated more stable hydrodynamic conditions that favoured the development of benthic microalgae biofilms. Dewatering of sediments during a 3-day emersion period promoted a salinity rise on top layers, migration of pore water ions towards the sediment surface, and created sediment fissures that accelerated water exchange on reflooding. Reflooded and waterlogged sediment systems were comparable with respect to the release of NH4+ to overlying water but were different with respect to nitrification rates. Sediment-water NH4+ fluxes were higher (P = 0.011) in March (3.3 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) compared to June (1.4 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) due to higher macrofauna biomasses. and lower benthic microalgae concentrations in March samples. Potential nitrification rates (range from 19 to 60 mmol NO3- m(-2) day(-1)) were not statistically different between March and June. A thinner oxic layer in reflooded compared with waterlogged systems reflects a decrease Of O-2 diffusion into sediment at high salinities which resulted in the fall of the actual nitrification rates (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that long term dessication of intertidal sediments may depress the nitrification process at the ecosystem level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We C-14-labeled cellulolytic bacteria and 3 species of bacterivorous nanoflagellates and fed these cultured organisms to 2 species of intertidal mussels, Geukensia demissa and Mytilus edulis, using a pulse-chase experimental design under controlled laboratory conditions. Ingestion and assimilation of C from these microheterotrophs by mussels were calculated from measured rates of defecation, respiration, excretion, and tissue incorporation. The proportion of available C ingested by G. demissa did not differ significantly among bacteria (39%), heterotrophic flagellates (58%), or the unicellular algae Isochrysis galbana (66%), which was used as a reference diet. In contrast, M. edulis ingested a significantly lower proportion (19%) of the small bacteria (<1 mu m in diameter) than the larger (3 to 5 mu m diameter) heterotrophic flagellates (58%). The efficiency with which G. demissa assimilated C from I. galbana (77%) was significantly greater than that from either bacteria (42%) or heterotrophic flagellates (44%). M. edulis assimilated bacterial C with significantly lower efficiency (21%) than C from heterotrophic flagellates (62%). These results indicate that heterotrophic flagellates can contribute to the C requirements of both G. demissa and M. edulis; however, only G. demissa is capable of assimilating a considerable amount of C from bacteria.

AB  - Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was used on Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA), for mosquito and gypsy moth mitigation, from 1948 until the insecticide was banned in the 1970s. There are historical accounts of major spray events, and DDT was expected to have remained immobile in the organic-rich sediments of local ponds. We investigated the potential for sediment cores from lakes on Cape Cod to reveal the depositional history of DDT. This compound and its metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (sigma DDT) were examined in sediment cores from four kettle lakes on Cape Cod that lie between the towns of Brewster and Harwich, where there is a detailed history of aerial spraying. Sediment cores were dated via Pb-210 and analyzed for water content, total carbon, total organic carbon, and organochlorine pesticide concentrations. Use of fallout Cs-137 to confirm Pb-210 dates was unsuccessful, probably because of post-depositional migration of Cs-137. sigma DDT inventories in each lake were determined to be 10ngcm(-2), which represents about 0.1% on an aerial basis of the quantity known to have been sprayed. Compared to the recorded spraying history, the concentration-depth maxima appear decades later than expected. The overall low quantity and unexpected temporal distribution of pesticide residues are probably explained by natural degradation of DDT in the sediment. A novel mathematical correction to DDT concentrations was applied and yielded adjusted inventories close to expected values, and moved the pesticide concentration maxima to the 1950s and 1960s, when they were expected to have occurred.

AB  - Aims Climate change (extreme rainfall) and water management activities have led to variation in hydrological regimes, especially inundation, which may alter the function and structure of wetlands as well as wetland-atmosphere carbon (C) exchange. However, the degree to which different inundation depths (standing water depth above the soil surface) affect ecosystem CH(4)fluxes, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and net ecosystem CO(2)exchange (NEE) remains uncertain in wetland ecosystems.
   Methods We conducted a field inundation depth manipulation experiment (no inundation, i.e. only natural precipitation; 0, water-saturated; 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm inundation depth) in a freshwater wetland of the Yellow River Delta, China. The CH(4)fluxes, R(eco)and NEE were measured with a static chamber technique during the growing seasons (May-October) of 2018 and 2019.
   Results Inundation depth significantly increased plant shoot density, above-water level leaf area index (WLAI), above-water level plant shoot height (WHeight), aboveground and belowground biomass of the dominant grassPhragmites australisin both years. Meanwhile, inundation depth increased the CH(4)fluxes, R-eco(except for 0 cm) and NEE compared to no inundation, which could be attributed partly to the increased plant productivity (shoot density, WLAI, WHeight, biomass). Additionally, the CH(4)fluxes, R(eco)or NEE exhibited parabolic responses to inundation depth. Furthermore, global warming potential (GWP) was significantly decreased under different inundation depths during the growing season, especially from 5 to 40 cm inundation depth in 2019. NEE was the largest contributor to the seasonal GWP, which indicates that the inundated wetlands are a net sink of C and have a cooling climate effect in the Yellow River Delta.
   Conclusions Inundation depth substantially affects the magnitude of CH(4)fluxes, R(eco)and NEE, which were correlated with altered plant traits in wetland ecosystems. Inundation depth could mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in theP. australiswetlands during the growing season. Inundation depth-induced ecosystem C exchange should be considered when estimating C sequestration capacity of wetlands due to climate change and water management activities, which will assist to accurately predict the impact of hydrological regimes on C cycles in future climate change scenarios.

AB  - In many coastal locations, seagrass meadows are part of a greater seascape that includes both marine and terrestrial elements, each linked to the other via the foraging patterns of consumers (both predators and herbivores), and the passive drift of seagrass propagules, leaves, roots and rhizomes, and seagrass-associated macroalgal detritus. With seagrasses declining in many regions, the linkages between seagrass meadows and other habitats are being altered and diminished. Thus, it is timely to summarize what is known about the prevalence and magnitude of cross-habitat exchanges of seagrass-derived energy and materials, and to increase awareness of the importance of seagrasses to adjacent and even distant habitats. To do so we examined the literature on the extent and importance of exchanges of biomass between seagrass meadows and other habitats, both in the form of exported seagrass biomass as well as transfers of animal biomass via migration. Data were most abundant for Caribbean coral reefs and Australian beaches, and organisms for which there were quantitative estimates included Caribbean fishes and North American migratory waterfowl. Overall, data from the studies we reviewed clearly showed that seagrass ecosystems provide a large subsidy to both near and distant locations through the export of particulate organic matter and living plant and animal biomass. The consequences of continuing seagrass decline thus extend far beyond the areas where seagrasses grow.

AB  - Rates of sulfate reduction were measured during the spring dry and summer wet seasons of 1992 in shallow coastal sediments of the central Great Barrier Reef lagoon. In the dry season, sulfate reduction rates, integrated to 18-20 cm depth, ranged from 23.8 to 30.8 mmol S m(-2) d(-1). In the wet season, heavy monsoonal rains and wind-induced waves caused severe disturbance of sediments leading to less anoxic conditions, and to a 2- to 3-fold decline in rates of sulfate reduction (10.2 to 12.8 mmol S m(-2) d(-1)). The percentage of reduced S-35 recovered as acid-volatile sulfide (% AVS(red)) ranged from 15.8 to 44.9% in spring, and was significantly reduced at each station in summer (range 14.5 to 31.4%). An analysis of variance indicated that seasonality accounted for 31.5% of the total variance in total rates of sulfate reduction, with only 7.5% of the variance accounted for by depth into the sediment; there were no station differences. In both seasons, there were no clear patterns in the proportion of radiolabel incorporated into the AVS and chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) pools with depth into the sediment. These results are contrary to the seasonal patterns and pathways of sulfate reduction in temperate coastal sediments.

AB  - Vertical temperature profiles during exposure and flooding of a sandy tidal flat were investigated at a single site in the Sado estuary (Portugal), and compared with the change in benthic nitrogen pools. Data from April 1994 (night and day flood periods), July and November 1994 were analysed in order to study possible convective transport induced by the changing thermal regime on a tidal time scale. An ecological consequence of the flooding of warm, permeable sediment beds by cool water was the reversal of porewater density gradients, leading to a quick exchange of porewater for flood water, in what constitutes a rapid, powerful pathway for benthic solute removal in tidal ecosystems. The matrix-averaged interstitial velocity of up- and downdraught plumes of water ranged between 10(-7) and 10(-6) m s(-1) over a depth scale of 6-10 cm. The Peclet number ranged from 1.4 to 28 in heavily bioturbated environments (D-Bs, for N solutes = 5 x 10(-9) m(2) s(-1)), and from 70 to 1400 in non-bioturbated environments (D-Bs for N solutes approximate to 10(-10) m(2) s(-1)). The results indicate that convective turnover of porewaters in permeable tidal flats is abrupt, may occur with daily frequency, and may have three orders of magnitude more impact on sediment-water fluxes than diffusion alone. Convective flow is a major component of sediment-water fluxes in tidal areas and crucial to accurate budget studies on the sandy intertidal. On the basis of these results and recent literature, the potential ecological importance of the Convective Turnover Pump is discussed, showing ii to be a very powerful potential accelerator of organic matter diagenesis in tidal systems due to its frequency and range of action.

AB  - Globally, coastlines are under pressure as coastal human population growth and urbanization continues, while climatic change leads to stormier seas and rising tides. These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. 'Soft' engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between government agencies, construction partners and research scientists.

AB  - This work is based on a compilation of benthic foraminiferal data collected in the Aveiro Lagoon and in the adjacent continental shelf and upper slope (center of Portugal). It intends to provide an overall analysis from transitional to the outer continental shelf of the occurrence and distribution of species in living and to present updated taxonomic data and illustrations of most of the species found in the in the Aveiro Lagoon and in the adjacent continental shelf including in total assemblages. Correspondence analysis (CA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) interpreted as depth functions allow us to identify the main species in different ecoenvironments and sectors of the study area. The most unusual living assemblage was documented in the lagoon inlet under very strong tidal currents activity, composed mostly by the following species (both in living and total assemblages): Rotaliammina concava, Lepidodeuterammina ochracea, Quinqueloculina seminula, Gavelinopsis praegeri, Paratrochammina haynesi, Remaneica helgolandica and Remaneicella gonalezi. The distribution patterns of some Trochamminidae and Remaneicidae species whose ecology and distribution pattern are poorly known, have proved to be a marker of more or less hydrodynamic and stable/unstable environments in coastal and transitional marine environments.

AB  - The fringing environments of lower Chesapeake Bay include sandy shoals, seagrass meadows, intertidal mud flats, and marshes. A characterization of a fringing ecosystem was conducted to provide initialization and calibration data for the development of a simulation model. The model simulates primary production and material exchange in the littoral zone of lower Chesapeake Bay. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) properties of water and sediments from sand, seagrass, intertidal silt-mud, and intertidal marsh habitats of the Goodwin Islands (located within the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Virginia, CBNERR-VA) were determined seasonally. Spatial and temporal differences in sediment microalgal biomass among the habitats were assessed along with annual variations in the distribution and abundance of Zostera marina L. and Spartina alterniflora Loisel. Phytoplankton biomass displayed some seasonality related to riverine discharge, but sediment microalgal biomass did not vary spatially or seasonally. Macrophytes in both subtidal and intertidal habitats: exhibited seasonal biomass patterns that were consistent with other Atlantic estuarine ecosystems. Marsh sediment organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen differed significantly from that of the sand, seagrass, and silt habitats. The only biogeochemical variable that exhibited seasonality was low marsh NH,I. The subtidal sediments were consistent temporally in their carbon and nitrogen content despite seasonal changes in seagrass abundance. Eelgrass has a comparatively low C:N ratio and is a potential N sink for the ecosystem. Changes in the composition or size of the vegetated habitats could have a dramatic influence over resource partitioning within the ecosystem. A spatial database (or geographic information system, GIS) of the Goodwin Islands site has been initiated to track long-term spatial habitat features and integrate model output and field data. This ecosystem characterization was conducted as part of efforts to link field data, geographic information, and the dynamic simulation of multiple habitats. The goal of these efforts is to examine ecological structure, function, and change in fringing environments of lower Chesapeake Bay.

AB  - Intertidal foraminifera from surface sediments are commonly used as a high-resolution indicator of sea-level change. The integrity of this approach is based upon the assumption that surface assemblages are similar in composition to their buried, fossil counterparts. This assumption may, in some cases, be inappropriate due to subsurface (or infaunal) production and taphonomic alteration. Here, we review the current understanding of foraminiferal production and taphonomic loss in intertidal environments, and examine the extent to which these processes can affect the development of foraminiferal assemblages in intertidal environments.
   As a sediment layer undergoes burial, dead tests are added at a rate proportionate to the standing crop at that depth. As a consequence, test accumulation within the layer is proportionate to the depth-integrated standing crop. Depending on the nature of its vertical living distribution, the upper 1 cm of sediment may therefore not adequately characterise a given species total input. Instead, a comparison of each species contribution to the entire, depth-integrated living community may offer a better a priori estimate of relative input to the sediment column. This provides an improved base-line for identifying 'true' taphonomic trends downcore.
   The potential for infauna to create discrepancies between surface and subsurface assemblages may be minimised however, where: (1) reproduction is concentrated near to the sediment surface, transforming an apparent infaunal standing crop into an effective epifaunal production; (2) the living fauna is composed similarly at all depths of production; and/or (3) intense bioturbation homogenises the upper sediment layers. The likely decline in the intensity of taphonomic processes with depth may mean that the foraminiferal production from different depths may not experience taphonomic processes uniformly. Consequently, in addition to their possible gradual enrichment due to subsurface production, infaunal species may be preferentially preserved by virtue of their production closer to the base of the taphonomically active zone. Additionally, homogenisation of the sediment column by reworking may mix temporally and perhaps environmentally distinct faunas, affecting the stratigraphic integrity of the sediment deposit.
   The most important taphonomic processes in intertidal environments are those associated with early diagenesis. While the organic cements of agglutinated taxa may be directly oxidised, the associated changes in the saturation state of porewaters with respect to calcium carbonate may affect calcareous species. The type of diagenetic reaction operating within the sediment provides a quantitative control on agglutinated test degradation but a largely qualitative control on calcareous preservation. In addition, calcareous test preservation is dependent upon the rate with which organic matter is supplied, while agglutinated test preservation is independent of organic matter concentrations. Although the specific morphological pathways of test degradation for calcareous species are well understood, the stages under which agglutinated tests are lost are less clear.
   The combined but varying influences of production (infaunal and species composition), taphonomic processes and bioturbation may create complex pathways in the transition from live to dead to fossil assemblages. Understanding the extent to which infauna, taphonomic loss, and sediment reworking affect assemblage development in different intertidal environments is essential in order to interpret the fossil record.

AB  - Several theories explaining the post-introduction evolution of invasive plants predict that specialist-enemy release often leads to decreased defense in introduced plants, but how novel generalist consumers in the introduced ranges affect plant-defense evolution remains largely unexplored. According to the shifting defense hypothesis, the decreased defense against specialist enemies may result in the increased defense against generalists. We compared resistance and tolerance of native (from the USA) and invasive populations (from China) of Spartina alterniflora to the dominant generalist insect Laelia coenosa in China. We also compared leaf traits between Spartina population origins. We found that Laelia had lower performance on invasive than on native Spartina populations. Native Spartina populations, however, had a greater capacity to compensate for leaf damage by Laelia than invasive ones. Although specific leaf area and leaf carbon content did not significantly vary between Spartina origins, invasive Spartina populations had lower leaf-nitrogen content than native populations. These results suggest that, following its introduction to China, Spartina has developed increased resistance but decreased tolerance to the generalist herbivore, which may be related to evolutionary increases in leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. These findings enhance our understanding of invasive plant defense against generalist herbivores in the introduced ranges and highlight the trade-off between resistance and tolerance.

AB  - Three species of the callianassid genus Nihonotrypaea occur intertidally in the Ariake Sound estuarine system, southem Japan; they consist of two sandflat species (N. japonica; N. harmandi) and one boulder-beach species (N. petalura). Nihonotrypaea harmandi and N. petalura are distributed along the coastline in the relatively oligotrophic sea area extending from the outermost part of the sound to the open sea, while N. japonica occurs in the more eutrophic area situated at the middle part of the sound. The trophic conditions of the two areas affect the abundance of phytoplankton in the water column relative to that of benthic microalgae in the sediment. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of N. japonica and its potential food sources have been analysed in an earlier study, specifying phytoplankton as the exclusive food source. Potential food sources for N. harmandi and N. petalura were analysed to make interspecific comparisons of the assimilated diets in relation to the shrimp habitat characteristics. Food sources of the shrimps were assessed based on the diet-tissue isotopic fractionation of N. harmandi and N. japonica (delta C-13=2.0 parts per thousand, delta N-15=4.0 parts per thousand), which had been determined by an earlier laboratory feeding experiment. Of several potential food sources for N. harmandi and N. petalura, riverine organic matter, sewage effluents, live/detrital terrestrial plants, and seagrass were not food sources. For N. petalura, live seaweed, in particular Sargassum spp., growing on boulders and cobbles during the seaweed high-growth season, and seaweed-derived detritus buried in the sediment and live Enteromorpha compressa during the seaweed low-growth season were the most likely food sources. For N. harmandi, phytoplankton (or fresh phytoplankton-derived detritus) and benthic microalgae constituted the most likely food sources. The delta C-13 value of the estimated diet for N. harmandi was higher than that for N. japonica by 0.6 parts per thousand, while the delta N-15 value for N. harmandi was lower by 2.6 parts per thousand. The food sources for the three species of Nihonotrypaea were species-specific, depending on each habitat characteristics. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oxidation rate of pyrite at pH 7, 25 degrees C and at constant partial pressure of oxygen (0.21 and 0.177 atm) was measured in the presence of the Fe(III)-chelators NTA, oxalate, leucine, EDTA, citrate, IDA and the Fe(III)-reductant ascorbic acid. With the exception of leucine and EDTA, non-reducing Fe(III)chelators increased the oxidation rate relative to the reference state of formation of the Fe(OH)(2)(+) complex at pH 7. The rate increase was proportional to the logarithm of the conditional stability constant of the ligands for the complexation of Fe3+. No effect on the oxidation rate was observed in the presence of EDTA, which shifted the redox potential of the redox couple Fe2+/Fe3+ to a Value below that in the absence of any Ligand at pH 7. Ascorbic acid decreased the pyrite oxidation rate by a factor of 5 at ascorbic acid concentrations between 10(-4) and 10(-2) mol L-1. Comparison of the rate constants for the oxidation of ascorbic acid by surface bound Fe(III) in the absence and presence of pyrite shows that the pyrite surface accelerates this reaction by a factor of 10. The oxidation of both pyrite and ascorbic acid is of fractional order with respect to ascorbic acid (HAsc):
   r(py) = 0.55 c(HAsC)(-0.35) rHAsc = 3.6 c(HAsc)(0.59)
   Both the results from experiments with Fe(III)-chelating ligands and the Fe(III)-reductant, suggest a very efficient interference in the electron cycling between Fe(II) and Fe(III) at the pyrite surface. The interference seems to be mainly related to the reductive side of the iron cycling. It is therefore concluded that the electron transfer between ferric iron and pyritic sulfur limits the pyrite oxidation rate at pH 7. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The role of ecosystem engineers has been highlighted in recent decades because of their importance for ecosystem functioning, although the interaction between different antagonistic engineer species and their effects on ecosystems have been so far poorly investigated. Coastal areas are good natural laboratories to explore such interactions, since they are often inhabited by macrophyte beds (autogenic engineers) and bioturbator species (allogenic engineers) with antagonistic effects on ecosystem properties and processes (e.g. species diversity, nutrient fluxes, etc.). The main goal of this study was to determine how coexisting antagonistic ecosystem engineers could influence benthic diversity and available resources in soft-bottom areas. To achieve this goal, a two-month experiment was carried out in situ by introducing artificial seagrass patches in a soft-bottom area inhabited by the fiddler crab Uca tangeri. Both the experimental exclusion of burrows as well as the presence of artificial seagrass-like structures (mimics) resulted in higher macrobenthic density and species richness in the benthic community. Resource availability for organisms (sediment chlorophyll a and epiphytes) was also favoured by the presence of mimics. Therefore, the higher structural complexity (above- and below-ground) associated with seagrass mimics promoted positive effects for infauna such as creation of a new habitat ready to colonize, reduction of the crab burrowing activity and the enhancement of resource availability, which resulted in increased diversity in the benthic community.

AB  - Sulfate reduction rate (SRR) and pools of reduced inorganic sulfur, acid volatile sulfide (AVS), chromium reducible sulfur (CRS), and elemental sulfur (S degrees), were studied from June 1990 till March 1992 at two locations on the Ballastplaat mudflat in the Scheldt estuary. The sediment composition at station A was mainly sand with low organic content whereas sediments at station B were dominated by silt and clay with high organic content. SRR was positively related to temperature; more pronounced at station B (Ea = 190 kJ mol(-1)) than at station A (Ea = 110 kJ mol(-1)). The maximum SRR values observed equalled 14 mu mol cm(-3) d(-1) at station B and 1 mu mol cm(-3) d(-1) at station A. AVS was the dominant radiolabelled end product of the sulfate reduction reaction, except in surface sediments where pyrite and S degrees were more dominant. However, CRS was the predominant reduced inorganic sulfur pool in the sediments. Both AVS and CRS pools showed temporal variations out of phase with SRR. SRR peaked in summer, while the concentrations of AVS and CRS were highest in fall. The accumulation of AVS and CRS started late summer after depletion of oxidants, which had accumulated during winter and spring. The estimated annual SRR and thus sulfide production in the upper 15 cm of station B was of the order of 100 mol m(-2) yr(-1), and at station A of the order of 12 mol m(-2) yr(-1). The sulfur mass balance shows that only a very small fraction, if any, of the produced sulfide is retained as reduced inorganic sulfur in the sediment.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity contributes to the maintenance of species diversity; however, little is known about the influence of microhabitat heterogeneity on the diversity of mangrove invertebrates. We tested the hypothesis that the structures of benthic faunal communities differ among microhabitats because each microhabitat function differs widely according to their physical properties. The descriptors of invertebrate assemblages were determined every March (dry season) and August (wet season) of 2005, 2006, and 2007 in three different mangrove microhabitats-tidal creek, deep forest, and canopy gap-of an intertidal mangrove forest around the Sikao Creek in the Trang Province of southern Thailand. The physical properties of the selected microhabitats were studied in 2005. The properties of each microhabitat varied, especially with respect to the light intensity and sediment moisture content: the tidal creeks were wet and well-exposed to sunlight, forest interiors were moist and dark, and the canopy gaps were dry and well-exposed to sunlight. Seasonal differences in the microhabitats were also noted. The numerical abundance and biomass of benthic macrofauna differed among the microhabitats; both values were the highest in canopy gaps, and these values increased in the wet season. Despite seasonal differences, species composition differed in the three microhabitats; the majority of animals were members of the epifauna; these were surface deposit feeders. Each microhabitat functioned differently because their physical properties were disparate. A diverse benthic faunal community is formed by a combination of different functional microhabitats in mangrove ecosystems, thereby indicating that microhabitat heterogeneity should be considered as an important factor influencing the structuring of a benthic community.

AB  - We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and their corresponding Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values in order to study the sources and fates of DOC in the York River Estuary (Virginia, U.S.A.). The Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of DOC and DIC at the freshwater end-member indicate that during periods of moderate to high flow, riverine DOC entering the York was composed of decadal-aged terrestrially organic matter. In nearly all cases, DOC concentrations exceeded conservative mixing lines and were therefore indicative of a net DOC input flux from within the estuary that averaged 1.2 muM L-1 d(-1).
   The nonconservative behavior of DOC in the York River Estuary was also apparent in carbon isotopic mixing curves and the application of an isotopic mixing model. The model predicted that 20-38% of the DOC at the mouth of the estuary was of riverine (terrestrial + freshwater) origin, while 38-56% was added internally, depending on the isotopic values assigned to the internally added DOG. Measurements of Delta C-14 and delta C-13 of DOC and DIC and marsh organic matter suggest that the internal sources originated from estuarine phytoplankton and marshes. The isotopic mixing model also indicates a significant concomitant loss (27-45%) of riverine DOC within the estuary.
   Changes in DOC concentration, Delta C-14-DOC, and delta C-13-DOC were also measured during incubation experiments designed to quantify the amounts, sources, and ages of DOC supporting the carbon demands of estuarine bacteria. Results of these experiments were consistent with an estuarine source of phytoplankton and marsh DOC and the preferential utilization of youngs (C-14-enriched) DOC in the low-salinity reaches of the York. However, the average removal of riverine DOC by bacteria accounts for only similar to4-19% of the riverine pool: therefore, other significant sinks for DOC exist within the estuary.

AB  - Experiments were performed utilizing the silica gel technique to synthesize pyrite crystals in four different chemical systems, at room temperature (ca. 23 degrees C), for periods of up to 24 months. These systems were: FeS(1-x(mackinawite))+ S degrees((s)) + H2S(aq), Fe3S4 (greitite) + H2S(aq), FeOOH(goethite) + H2S(aq) and Fe-(aq)(2+) + S-4(aq)(2-). Results indicate that the rate of pyrite formation strongly depends on the nature of solid reactant and solution chemistry (pH and total sulfide concentration). The formation of pyrite is most rapid in the presence of greigite. The pyritization of metastable iron sulfide minerals follows a dissolution-precipitation pathway.
   Two mechanisms are proposed for the nucleation behavior of pyrite on metastable iron sulfide minerals. The first mechanism is heterogeneous nucleation. This is a result of epitaxial overgrowth of pyrite nuclei at defects on a precursor mineral's surface. A second possible mechanism is that pyrite clusters, smaller than the critical nucleus, are concentrated on the surface of precursor iron sulfide minerals under the influence of crystal molecular field. This forms a transition layer between the precursor sulfide mineral and the bulk solution where nucleation of pyrite is accelerated.
   SEM observations indicate that the morphology of pyrite crystals formed at room temperature is primarily controlled by the degree of supersaturation in the solution from which pyrite is precipitated. With the increasing supersaturation, pyrite morphology changes in the following order: cube --> octahedron --> spherulite. The influence of other parameters, such as relative abundance of Fe2+ and dissolved zero-valance sulfur, were not observed to be of major significance for morphology.

AB  - Soil haloform emissions are sources of reactive halogens that catalytically deplete ozone in the stratosphere but there are still unknown or underestimated haloform sources. The > 200 000 ha of low-lying tidal freshwater swamps (forests and marshes) in the south-eastern United States could be haloform (CHX3, X = Cl or Br) sources because sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion bring halides inland where they mix with terrestrial humic substances. To evaluate the spatial variation along the common forest-marsh salinity gradient (freshwater wetland, oligohaline wetland and mesohaline saltmarsh), we measured chloroform emissions from in situ chambers and from laboratory incubations of soil and water samples collected from Winyah Bay, South Carolina. The in situ and soil-core haloform emissions were both highest in the oligohaline wetland, whereas the aqueous production was highest in mesohaline saltmarsh. The predominant source shifted from sediment emission to water emission from freshwater wetland to mesohaline saltmarsh. Spreading out soil samples increased soil haloform emission, suggesting that soil pores can trap high amounts of CHCl3. Soil sterilisation did not suppress CHCl3 emission, indicating the important contribution of abiotic soil CHCl3 formation. Surface wetland water samples from eight locations along a salinity gradient with different management practices (natural v. managed) were subjected to radical-based halogenation by Fenton-like reagents. Halide availability, organic matter source, temperature and light irradiation were all found to affect the radical-based abiotic haloform formation from surface water. This study clearly indicates that soil and water from the studied coastal wetlands are both haloform sources, which however appear to have different formation mechanisms.

AB  - Contaminated sediments deposited within urban water bodies commonly exert a significant negative effect on overlying water quality. However, our understanding of the processes operating within such anthropogenic sediments is currently poor. This paper describes the nature of the sediment and early diagenetic reactions in a highly polluted major urban water body (the Salford Quays of the Manchester Ship Canal) that has undergone remediation focused on the water column.
   The style of sedimentation within Salford Quays has been significantly changed as a result of remediation of the water column. Pre-remediation sediments are composed of a range of natural detrital grains, predominantly quartz and clay, and anthropogenic detrital material dominated by industrial furnace-derived metal-rich slag grains. Post-remediation sediments are composed of predominantly autochthonous material, including siliceous algal remains and clays. At the top of the pre-remediation sediments and immediately beneath the post-remediation sediments is a layer significantly enriched in furnace-derived slag grains, input into the basin as a result of site clearance prior to water-column remediation. These grains contain a high level of metals, resulting in a significantly enhanced metal concentration in the sediments at this depth.
   Porewater analysis reveals the importance of both bacterial organic matter oxidation reactions and the dissolution of industrial grains upon the mobility of nutrient and chemical species within Salford Quays. Minor release of iron and manganese at shallow depths is likely to be taking place as a result of bacterial Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction. Petrographic analysis reveals that the abundant authigenic mineral within the sediment is manganese-rich vivianite, and thus Fe(II) and Mn(II) released by bacterial reactions may be being taken up through the precipitation of this mineral. Significant porewater peaks in iron, manganese and silicon deeper in the sediment column are most probably the result of dissolution of furnace-derived grains in the sediments. These species have subsequently diffused into porewater above and below the metal-enriched layer.
   This study illustrates that the remediation of water quality in anthropogenic water bodies can significantly impact upon the physical and chemical nature of sedimentation. Additionally, it also highlights how diagenetic processes in sediments derived from anthropogenic grains can be markedly different from those in sediments derived from natural detrital material.

AB  - This chapter gives an overview of redox processes occurring within surface waters, sediments, and sediment pore waters of estuaries. Attention is given to parameters inducing stratification and redox zonation, as well as related differences between river deltas and fjords. Factors affecting metal speciation, mobility, and availability in oxic estuarine environments are discussed, followed by the role of redox processes when the estuarine environment evolves toward anoxic conditions. Thereafter, focus is on the fate of metals as affected by occasional oxidation of reduced environments. Physicochemical extraction methods that are helpful to assess risks related to the presence of metals in estuarine floodplain soils and sediments are discussed.

AB  - This study applied the static chamber method to evaluate the CO2 fluxes from December 2013 to October 2014 in the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China. The study area was divided into Spartina alterniflora flat, Phragmites australis flat, Suaeda salsa flat and mud flat. Results showed that net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) presented obviously temporal and spatial variations during growing season, and slight fluctuation in non-growing season. Vegetated flats (S. alterniflora flat, P. australis flat and S. salsa flat) acted as CO2 sinks during growing season and CO2 sources during non-growing season; while mud flat acted as a CO2 sink through the entire period. Over the growing season, the estimated total NEE were -1202.83 g CO2 m(-2) in S. alterniflora flat, - 1129.16 g CO2 m(-2) in P. australis flat and -237.43 g CO2 m(-2) in S. salsa flat, respectively. Daytime NEE were significantly exponential related to light intensity in S. alterniflora flat and P. australis flat; whereas no overt exponential relationship was found between these two factors in S. salsa flat. In P. australis flat, ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) in growing season were estimated to be 2874.05 and 1744.89 g CO2 m(-2), respectively; R-eco was significantly exponential related to air temperature and soil temperature at different depths, among which soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm was the most remarkable; temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-eco ranged from 2.72 to 3.67. Above ground biomass of P. australis over the entire growing season showed nonlinear relationships with NEE, GPP, and R-eco; while it showed significant linear relationships with these three factors during early and peak growing season. As for the mud flat acing as a CO2 sink, it is supposed to be caused by inorganic process, however the mechanism is not definite. Further research on the long-term and complete observations of CO2 exchange at the mud flat-atmosphere interface is necessary.

AB  - 1. The general knowledge about hyphomycetes is summarized and traits of some of these organisms in the Rhone floodplain are described to assess compliance with the river habitat templet (RHT) and patch dynamics concept (PDC) hypotheses. This investigation corresponds with those for other taxonomic groups reported in a recent Freshwater Biology Special Issue on the Ecology of the Upper Rhone River (Statzner, Resh & Doledec, 1994).
   2. Three groups of fungi were considered: aquatic, terrestrial, and aero-aquatic hyphomycetes.
   3. The main factors controlling distribution of these micro-organisms are food (mostly organic matter), dissolved oxygen and biotic interactions.
   4. With contrasting strategies, hyphomycetes exploit both fallen leaves, a discrete ephemeral resource, and wood fragments, which are more durable.
   5. Fungal propagules (spores, hyphae) are distributed in the water, and even the air, largely throughout the year. This explains the resilience of these organisms to disturbance.
   6. A major problem is the spatial (boundary layer, dead zones) and temporal (leaf input) scale at which these micro-organisms live and their interactions at the scale adopted for the other organisms referred to in the Special Issue on the Ecology of the Upper Rhone.
   7. Our scant knowledge of the microbial ecology in the Rhone floodplain, together with the scale problem and high microbial resilience to environmental stress, render the RHT and PDC hypotheses difficult to test. Only three traits could be tested on hyphomycetes, but all three confirmed the RHT hypotheses.
   8. Hyphomycete communities appear to be biologically controlled in more favourable and temporally stable environments, and physico-chemically controlled in harsher and more perturbed environments.

AB  - Sediment samples were monthly collected at Queule river estuary (ca. 39 degrees S), south-central Chile, from October 1990 to April 1992, and from September 1995 to November 1997 to study temporal variability in population abundances of the macroinfauna inhabiting sandy and muddy-sand intertidal substrates. Sandy sediments had higher percentages of sand particles and lower percentages of mud particles, biogenic aggregates and total organic matter than muddy-sand sediments. The same macroinfaunal species were found at both sites. That macroinfauna was dominated by polychaetes: the spionid Prionospio (Minuspio) patagonica Augener 1923, the capitellid Capitella sp. and the nereid Perinereis gualpensis Jeldes 1963, Other common organisms were the amphipod Paracorophium hartamannorum Andres 1975 and the small bivalve Kingiella chilenica Soot-Ryen 1959. The highest abundances of the total macroinfauna usually ocurred during summer months (January-February), The most abundant species was P. (M,) patagonica (up to 130-140,000 ind m(-2) in the muddy-sand sediments). During some months, this species had significantly higher abundances at the muddy-sand sediments. A similar trend is that shown by P. hartmannorum; i.e., significantly higher abundances at the muddy-sand sediments (up to 75,000 ind m(-2)). During many months, the population abundances of Capitella sp. and K. chilenica were significantly higher at the sandy site. The highest population abundances of Capitella sp. were close to 37,800 ind m(-2) (February 1991 and February 1996), while the maximum values for K. chilenica ranged from 13.000 to 14,000 ind m(-2) (February 1991 and November 1995, respectively). The population abundances of P. gualpensis (with the exception of the period October 1995-January 1996) were similar at both sites. Interannual comparisons of macroinfaunal abundances carried out for the sandy site showed no significant differences among years for the total macroinfauna and for all the species, but P. gualpensis. No significant differences among years were found for the total macroinfauna, P. (M.)patagonica, P. gualpensis and P. hartmannorum at the muddy-sand site. On the other hand, the abundances of Capitella sp. and K. chilenica differed significantly among years. Significant differences among months within annual periods were found for the total macroinfauna and species population abundances at the sandy and muddy-sand sites, The temporal variability of the macroinfauna did not have any significant relationship with the temporal variability in sediment characteristics.

AB  - The use of mineral magnetic concentration parameters (chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM) as a potential particle size proxy for soil samples collected from Wolverhampton (UK) is explored as an alternative means of normalizing particle size effects. Comparison of soil-related analytical data by correlation analyses between each magnetic parameter and individual particle size classes (Le. sand, silt and clay), more discrete intervals within classes (e.g. fine sand or medium silt) and cumulative size fractions (e.g. clay + fine silt) are reported. chi(LF), chi(ARM) and SIRM parameters reveal significant (p < 0.05; p < 0.001 n = 60), moderate negative (rs = -0.3 to -0.557) associations with clay, silt and sand content. Contrary to earlier research findings which found positive relationships, this indicates that magnetic measurements cannot always provide a predictable particle size proxy and it is only certain environments and/or specific settings that are appropriate for granulometric normalization by this technique. However, if future researchers working in other soil settings can identify a formal predictable relationship, the technique is known to offer a simple, reliable, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and non-destructive approach that could be a valuable proxy for normalizing particle size effects in soil contamination studies.

AB  - Radiolabeled hydrogen sulfide (HS-)-S-35 was used to trace the anoxic sulfur transformations in marine and freshwater sediment slurries. Time course studies consistently showed a rapid (S2O3=)-S-35 formation and a progressive accumulation of (SO4=)-S-35 and thus indicated an anoxic sulfide oxidation to sulfate. Thiosulfate was partly turned over by oxidation or disproportionation and was found to be an intermediate in the (SO4=)-S-35 formation. The results demonstrate that oxidative and reductive sulfur cycling may occur simultaneously in marine and freshwater sediments. When added as exogenous oxidant, nitrate (NO3-) stimulated the anoxic sulfide oxidation to sulfate. Ferric iron, added in the form of lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), caused the precipitation of iron sulfides and only partial sulfide oxidation to pyrite and elemental sulfur.

AB  - More than 100 species belonging to plant and animal tars that are commonly observed in the intertidal zone were collected on both rocky and soft bottom shores of Brittany, France, to be analysed for their C-13/C-12 ratio. Plant material displayed a wide range of delta(13)C values (from -12 to -34 parts per thousand), with relatively distinct values among producer groups (Chlorophyce ae, Fucales, Laminariales, Rhodophyce ae seagrasses, plankton), and among strata of intertidal zonation. Animal delta(13)C range was narrower (-15 to -22 parts per thousand), and in general, values differed more between than within phyla or classes, according to the staple diet of organisms. A good correlation between the delta(13)C values of food and consumers was noted, together with a slight C-13-enrichment (approximate to 1 parts per thousand) with increasing trophic levels from suspension-feeders to predators.

AB  - The last decade witnessed a paradigm shift concerning the impact of functional diversity on ecosystem functioning, and biological invasions have led to profound effects on functional diversity. However, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of exotic plants on macrobenthic functional diversity is not available for mangrove ecosystems. The macrobenthic functional feeding groups were compared in (1) a noninvaded stand vs. an Spartina alterniflora-invaded stand of the mangrove tree Avicennia marina (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and (2) a noninvaded unvegetated shoal vs. an invaded shoal (a S. alterniflora monoculture) in Zhanjiang, China. The results indicated that the phytophagous group was the dominant functional feeding group regardless of habitat or macrobenthic parameter (species richness, abundance, and biomass) percentages. For all macrobenthic parameters, the carnivorous percentages were significantly higher in the S. alterniflora and A. marina mixture than in the A. marina monoculture. Except for species richness, the same was true for the S. alterniflora monoculture compared to the unvegetated shoal. The presence of the exotic cordgrass S. alterniflora is likely to attract more carnivorous macrobenthic fauna in a Zhanjiang mangrove ecosystem. Further analysis revealed that the sediment silt and plant density were the principal environmental variables determining the composition proportion of macrobenthic functional feeding groups. The lower sediment silt proportion and higher plant density ascribed to S. alterniflora invasions might be responsible for the changes in the proportion of macrobenthic functional feeding groups. The results aid the understanding of the effects and mechanisms of plant invasions on benthic functional diversity of mangrove ecosystems and yield insights into the links of biological invasions, functional diversity, and ecosystem functioning in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - We investigated the environmental impacts of long-line aquaculture of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) on sediment geochemistry and carbon oxidation by sulfate reduction and diffusive benthic nutrient flux in a coastal ecosystem in Korea. Inventories of the NH4+, and HPO42- at the farm site were 7.7-11.5 and 1.8-8.0 times higher, respectively, than those at a reference site. Sulfate reduction rates (SRRs) at the oyster farm were 2.4-5.2 times higher than SRRs at the reference site. The SRRs at the farm site were responsible for 48-99% (average 70%) of the total C oxidation in the sediment. The diffusive benthic fluxes of NH4+, and HPO42- at the oyster farm were comparable to 30-164% and 19-58%, respectively, of the N and P demands for primary production, and were responsible for the enhanced benthic microalgal biomass on the surface sediment.

AB  - Iron (Fe) biogeochemistry in marine sediments is driven by redox transformations creating Fe(II) and Fe(III) gradients. As sediments are physically mixed by wave action or bioturbation, Fe gradients re-establish regularly. In order to identify the response of dissolved Fe(II) (Fe2+) and Fe mineral phases toward mixing processes, we performed voltammetric microsensor measurements, sequential Fe extractions, and Mossbauer spectroscopy of 12 h light-dark cycle incubated marine coastal sediment. Fe2+ decreased during 7 days of undisturbed incubation from approximately 400 to 60 mu M. In the first 2-4 days of incubation, Fe2+ accumulated up to 100 pM in the top 2 mm due to Fe(III) photoreduction. After physical perturbation at day 7, Fe2+ was remobilized reaching concentrations of 320 mu M in 30 mm depth, which decreased to below detection limit within 2 days afterward. Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that the relative abundance of metastable iron-sulfur mineral phases (FeSx) increased during initial incubation and decreased together with pyrite (FeS2) after perturbation. We show that Fe2+ mobilization in marine sediments is stimulated by chemical changes caused by physical disturbances impacting the Fe redox distribution. Our study suggests that, in addition to microbial and abiotic Fe(III) reduction, including Fe(III) photoreduction, physical mixing processes induce chemical changes providing sediments and the inhabiting microbial community with Fe2+.

AB  - The study was conducted to highlight the distribution of trace metals in the world's largest mangrove ecosystem, Sundarban, in India and Bangladesh. A speciation technique was used to document the bioavailability and environmental hazards associated with operationally defined chemical forms of trace metals.
   Seven sediment cores were selected to study the speciation of selected trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in the sedimentary mangrove environment. A modified European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) three-step sequential extraction procedure was used to target chemical forms.
   Texture analysis showed that the hydrodynamic conditions prevailing in the region are high in energy that leads to the deposition of sediment fractions in the following order: silt > clay > sand. The fine-grained sediments have the potential for binding trace metals. The trace metal content was higher in the fine-grained fraction that was dominant in the Indian Sundarban (IS) than Bangladesh Sundarban (BS). The ranges of concentrations of four trace metals were as follows: 38,760-52,829 mu g g(-1) for Fe, 424-770 mu g g(-1) for Mn, 36-82 mu g g(-1) for Cu and 55-83 mu g g(-1) for Zn in IS, while in BS, the ranges were 29,081-45,025 mu g g(-1) for Fe, 342-792 mu g g(-1) for Mn, 12-45 mu g g(-1) for Cu and 29-75 mu g g(-1) for Zn. Speciation suggested the dominance of Mn in the acid-soluble fraction (> 68 % IS; > 52 % BS) while Fe (> 83 % IS; > 80 % BS), Cu (> 56 % IS; > 60 % BS) and Zn (> 77 % IS; > 80 % BS) dominated in the residual fraction. The speciation pattern showed that due to low organic carbon (OC) content (< 0.99 % IS; < 1.52 % BS), the Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide fraction (fraction 2) acts as a scavenging phase for Fe, Cu and Zn. The Risk Assessment Code (RAC) showed moderate to very high risk with respect to Cu and Mn, whereas Fe and Zn were in the low-risk category suggesting an anthropogenic influence with respect to Cu and Mn.
   The dominance of Cu and Mn in the non-residual fraction suggests anthropogenic sources, such as port-related activities and sewage runoff. The study highlights the dominance of anthropogenic activity and lack of freshwater flow in IS compared to BS, which affects the speciation profile of trace metals in the mangrove sediments.

AB  - Biodegradation inhibition of a benchmark chemical, 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid methyl ester (2,4-DME), was used to quantify the inhibitory effects of heavy metals on aerobic microbial degradation rates of organic chemicals.  This procedure used lake sediments and aufwuchs (floating mats) collected in the field or from laboratory microcosms.  Effects of CuCl2, HgCl2, ZnCl2, Cd(NO3)2, and Cr(NO3)3 at initial concentrations ranging from 0.3-mu-M to 73 mM (approximately 0.1 to 10,000 mg liter-1) were investigated.  In general, such metallic compounds appeared to be considerably more inhibitory to the biodegradation of an organic chemical than high concentrations of microbially toxic organics studied previously.  Effects of various metal concentrations were evaluated based on the following:  (i) estimated MICs, (ii) concentrations that caused a significant effect on biodegradation parameters (both a > 10% decrease in V(max) and a > 10% increase in t1/2 for 2,4-DME degradation), and (iii) concentrations that caused biodegradation half-life doublings (HLDs).  The MICs of metals in sediment were lowest for Zn2+ (0.10-mu-M) and highest for Cd2+ and Cu2+ (0.9 and 1.2-mu-M, respectively).  The MICs of metals in aufwuchs were lowest for Hg2+ (0.01-mu-M), intermediate for Cu2+ and Zn2+ (0.42 and 0.62-mu-M, respectively), and highest for Cr3+ and Cd2+ (3.4 and 5.6-mu-M, respectively).  Compared with Cu2+ on aufwuchs, 70 times more Zn2+, 250 times more Cr3+, and 1,000 times more Cd2+ was required to significantly affect aufwuchs biodegradation rate parameters and coefficients (V(max) and t1/2).  Aufwuchs was significantly affected by the lowest Hg2+ concentration tested (5-mu-M).  The HLDs of metals in sediment were 0.17, 0.24, and 0.79 mM for Cu2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+, respectively.  The HLDs of metals in aufwuchs were 2.0 and 3.0-mu-M for Cu2+ and Hg2+, respectively, and 0.14, 0.44, and 1.2 mM for Cr3+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, respectively.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affects songbird populations across a variety of ecosystems following conversion to methylmercury (MeHg)-a form of Hg with high potential for bioaccumulation and bioavailability. The amount of bioavailable MeHg in an ecosystem is a function of the amount of total Hg present as well as Hg methylation rates, which vary across the landscape in space and time, and trophic transfer. Using songbirds as an indicator of MeHg bioavailability in terrestrial ecosystems, we evaluated the role of habitat, climate, and trophic level in dictating MeHg exposure risk across a variety of ecosystems. To achieve this objective, 2243 blood Hg samples were collected from 81 passerine and near-passerine species in New York State, USA, spanning 10 different sampling regions from Long Island to western New York. Using a general linear mixed modeling framework that accounted for regional variation in sampling species composition, we found that wetland habitat area within 100 m of capture location, 50-year average of summer maximum temperatures, and trophic position inferred using stable isotope analysis were all correlated with songbird blood Hg concentrations statewide. Moreover, these patterns had a large degree of spatial variability suggesting that the drivers of MeHg bioavailability differed significantly across the state. Mercury deposition, land cover, and climate are all expected to change throughout the northeastern United States in the coming decades. Terrestrial MeHg bioavailability will likely respond to these changes. Focused research and monitoring efforts will be critical to understand how exposure risk responds to global environmental change across the landscape.

AB  - Frequent and unexplained iron enrichments have been localized in buried, Holocene, marine sediments in coastal areas. These buried sediments are nowadays often part of groundwater systems in densely populated deltas. Here, the Krabbenkreek intertidal/supratidal area in the Netherlands is considered as a present analogue for diagenetic processes in these near-shore sediments. We evaluate the role of tidally driven groundwater flow alternations on the transport and speciation of Fe in deep tidal sediments. This was achieved by examining geochemical sediment and porewater data in the context of 3-D geohydrological modelling results of the groundwater system. The Krabbenkreek area presents clear hydrologic and geochemical zonations across the supratidal/intertidal area. Due to the low hydraulic conductivity, groundwater flow and infiltration of rain water is limited in the mud-rich upper sediments of the supratidal flat. Despite tidal fluctuations of the hydraulic heads up to 1.5 m, the corresponding alternating groundwater flow is relatively minor in comparison to the net groundwater flow. Tidal variations in the groundwater force field alone did not lead to pronounced local enrichments in reactive Fe. Differences in reactive Fe contents in deep sediments can be related to textural differences, implying that no indications for local, diagenetic Fe enrichments were found in the sediments down to 5 m depth. Contents of FeS and amorphous Fe(III) are remarkably low indicating little current dynamics in Fe redox cycling in these deep sediments, while the porewater chemistry indicates that pyrite oxidation prevails. Long-term oxidation of pyrite is reflected by the presence of Fe(III) oxides in the high marsh sediments while pyrite still dominates in the middle marsh and the intertidal sediments. Absence of active Fe redox cycling can be attributed to low respiratory activity in the sediments. Previous studies reported that sedimentary organic matter in the vicinity of the investigated area can be predominately refractory, which can probably explain the low respiratory activity in the Krabbenkreek sediments.

AB  - Although microbial mats are known worldwide to contribute to trophic bases in shallow marine embayments, their role has yet to be ascertained for similar habitats in the Arabian Gulf region. In this study, stable carbon isotope analysis in conjunction with faecal and gut analyses were employed to evaluate the relative importance of microbial mats in the nutrition of macrofaunal consumers and their contribution to the exceptional biodiversity, abundance and biomass of species inhabiting Sulaibikhat Bay mudflats (2000-2001) in the absence of extensive macro-vegetation. Microbial mats were mainly composed of diatoms and cyanobacteria (approx. 70 and 30% respectively), with a reduction in the latter with decreasing intertidal gradient. Faeces of 5 out of the 6 species analysed contained both mat components at varying degrees. Diatoms occurred rarely in faeces of the high intertidal consumers, while cyanobacteria dominated the faeces of those occurring at lower levels. Gut analysis revealed that 6 Out of the 9 species analysed contained mat residues. Primary producers had distinct delta C-13 values with microbial mats showing a heavy signature (-15.3 parts per thousand) in comparison to the halophyte Salicornia herbacea (-24.7 parts per thousand), phytoplankton (-21.6 parts per thousand) and the mangrove Avicennia marina (-28.1 parts per thousand). The VC values for herbivorous, omnivorous and carnivorous macrofauna ranged between -9.4 and -15.3 parts per thousand. It appears from this investigation that microbial mats form the primary source of nutrition for both benthic and pelagic macrofaunal species within the bay including commercially important species, and that selective assimilation/digestion of cyanophytes from the mats is the likely explanation for the relatively high enrichment in the delta C-13 signatures of species located along the higher intertidal zone.

AB  - Microbial mats characteristically are dominated by a few functional groups of microbes: cyanobacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Their combined metabolic activities result in steep environmental microgradients, particularly of oxygen and sulfide.
   The driving force of most microbial mats is photosynthesis by cyanobacteria and algae. Subsequently, sulfate-reducing bacteria, using excretion-, lysis-, and decomposition products of cyanobacteria, produce sulfide by the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate. The sulfide can be reoxidized to sulfate by colorless and purple sulfur bacteria.
   Colorless sulfur bacteria are chemotrophic organisms primarily oxidizing sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur with oxygen to obtain energy. The oxidation of reduced sulfur species also provides reducing equivalents for the reduction of carbon dioxide to cellular carbon. The final product of sulfide oxidation is sulfate, with elemental sulfur, deposited extracellularly, as the principal intermediate.
   Purple sulfur bacteria primarily are anaerobic phototrophic organisms using sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur exclusively as the electron donor for the reduction of CO2 to cellular carbon. Usually, sulfur is temporarily stored intracellularly. The final product of the oxidation of reduced forms of sulfur is sulfate.
   The niches for these metabolically different groups of microbes in ecosystems with steep, often non-overlapping, gradients of oxygen and sulfide appear to be spatially separated. However, maximum viable counts of colorless sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria were both found in the top 5-10 mm of mats. Unexpectedly, viable counts of sulfate-reducing bacteria also peaked at the same depth horizon.
   Sulfide is inhibitory for most oxygenic phototrophs. Sulfide production immediately underneath the layer of cyanobacteria might inhibit their growth, and, consequently, that of the entire ecosystem. In microbial mats this effect is minimized by the combined action of colorless and purple sulfur bacteria. Colorless sulfur bacteria generally have a much higher affinity for sulfide than purple sulfur bacteria, however, in microbial mats, their activity is hampered by low oxygen supply rates. As shown by pure culture studies with colorless sulfur bacteria, sulfide is incompletely oxidized when oxygen is short in supply, resulting in the production of potential electron donors for purple sulfur bacteria, such as sulfur, thiosulfate and polysulfides. In the absence of purple sulfur bacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria would not be able to maintain a low sulfide concentration due to shortage of oxygen, which in turn would result in increased inhibition of oxygenic photosynthesis.
   It thus appears that the combined action of all four groups of functional microbes mentioned effectively results in optimal growth of these recent ''stromatolites''.

AB  - We constructed an empirical mass balance model of nutrient fluxes in the Ogeechee River estuary (Georgia, USA) from eight surveys of seasonal estuarine nutrient concentrations during 2015 and 2016. The model results indicated a net removal of dissolved phosphorus and a net production of dissolved nitrogen (N) within the estuary over an annual cycle. During summer and autumn low flow periods, much of the dissolved N discharged to the ocean seems to be recycled into the estuary in the form of phytoplankton biomass. As a result, the outwelled N is not new nitrogen fueling coastal production but is nitrogen trapped within a recycling loop across the ocean-estuarine boundary. Higher flows in the fall and winter lead to direct discharge of nutrients with minimal recycling. A balanced N budget for the Ogeechee River estuary requires that estuarine N-fixation must exceed burial and denitrification losses within the estuary.

AB  - In order to determine the impact of nutrient enrichment on phosphorus (P) limited wetlands, we established experimental P additions in marshes throughout northern Belize. P significantly increased macrophyte primary production, which led to the rapid elimination of cyanobacterial mats. The replacement of cyanobacterial mats by macrophytes constrained autotrophic nitrogen (N) fixation, increased the quantity, and changed the quality of organic matter input to the sediments. We predicted that the activity of sediment heterotrophic N fixers will be impacted by these alterations in carbon input. We used the acetylene reduction technique to measure potential (glucose amended) nitrogenase activity (NA) in sediments from controls and treatment plots that have been P enriched for four years and dominated either by Eleocharis cellulosa, or Typha domingensis for two years. NA in P-enriched plots was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than NA in controls. NA was positively correlated with the soil reactive P, both total organic and microbial carbon, live root biomass, and total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) as an indicator of active microbial biomass. It was negatively correlated with the concentration of ammonium-N. Path analysis revealed that the indirect effect of P on NA through the root biomass was more important than the direct effect of P. NA of the upper sediment layer was consistently higher in Eleocharis than in Typha dominated plots, despite the higher litter input by Typha. We feel that the higher levels of lignin and phenolics occurring in Typha litter, relative to Eleocharis, constrained NA in Typha plots.

AB  - This study aims to determine the drivers of root decomposition and its role in carbon (C) budgets in mangroves and saltmarsh. We review the patterns of root decomposition, and its contribution to C budgets, in mangroves and saltmarsh: the impact of climatic (temperature and precipitation), geographic (latitude), temporal (decay period) and biotic (ecosystem type) drivers using multiple regression models. Best-fit models explain 50% and 48% of the variance in mangrove and saltmarsh root decay rates, respectively. A combination of biotic, climatic, geographic and temporal drivers influences root decay rates. Rainfall and latitude have the strongest influence on root decomposition rates in saltmarsh. For mangroves, forest type is the most important; decomposition is faster in riverine mangroves than other types. Mangrove species Avicennia marina and saltmarsh species Spartina maritima and Phragmites australis have the highest root decomposition rates. Root decomposition rates of mangroves were slightly higher in the Indo-west Pacific region (average 0.16% day(-1)) than in the Atlantic-east Pacific region (0.13% day(-1)). Mangrove root decomposition rates also show a negative exponential relationship with porewater salinity. In mangroves, global root decomposition rates are 0.15% day(-1) based on the median value of rates in individual studies (and 0.14% day(-1) after adjusting for area of mangroves at different latitudes). In saltmarsh, global root decomposition rates average 0.12% day(-1) (no adjustment for area with latitude necessary). Our global estimate of the amount of root decomposing is 10 Tg C yr(-1) in mangroves (8 Tg C yr(-1) adjusted for area by latitude) and 31 Tg C yr(-1) in saltmarsh. Local root C burial rates reported herein are 51-54 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for mangroves (58-61 Tg C yr(-1) adjusted for area by latitude) and 191 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for saltmarsh. These values account for 24.1-29.1% (mangroves) and 77.9% (saltmarsh) of the reported sediment C accumulation rates in these habitats. Globally, dead root C production is the significant source of stored sediment C in mangroves and saltmarsh. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many efforts have been made to control invasive Spartina alterniflora and to restore coastal wetlands along the Pacific Rim. This study is the first to report the effects of a Spartina-eradication program on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study S. alterniflora was eradicated in a pilot program covering an area of 0.63 km(2) in a Yangtze River estuarine wetland. In the following year after the eradication program was complete, plant growth, soil microbial activities, as well as CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions were investigated. S. alterniflora ramets did not re-grow after the eradication program, while a native plant, Phragmites australis, thrived and produced taller but rather thinner ramets. CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions in areas previously covered by S. alterniflora declined based on measurements made a year after eradication. This may have been caused by the removal of this plant as well as by flooding and/or by the reduced soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase and beta-glucosidase activities. CH4 fluxes significantly increased in the program sites where the native species P. australis was retained, while CO2 and N2O fluxes showed no significant changes. Our study revealed that GHG emissions can be greatly altered by an invasive plant eradication program and analysis of such emissions should be included in comprehensive assessments designed to guide successful restoration practices. Based on scenario analysis, we suggest that from the view of GHG emission equivalency, planting P. australis in approximately 50% of the area where S. alterniflora was eradicated would be appropriate in future management.

AB  - Plant invasions in coastal ecosystems may substantially alter benthic community composition and food web structure. We combined analyses of stable isotopes and fatty acids (FA) to examine the effects of two non-indigenous plants (Spartina alterniflora and Kandelia candel) on the food sources of three deposit feeders (Assiminea brevicula, Cerithidea cingulata and Uca arcuata) and a carnivorous opportunistic predator (Periophthalmus modestus) in Yueqing Bay, China. A wide range of differences was found in delta C-13 and delta N-15 among the macrobenthos. The deposit feeders in K. candel mangrove forest (KC) were markedly more C-13-depleted than those in S. alternifiora marsh (SA) and unvegetated tidal flat (TF), unlike the carnivorous feeder. PERMANOVA showed that FA composition significantly differed among the macmbenthos. Diatom FA markers were higher in tissues of the deposit feeders than in the carnivorous feeder, and slightly lower in macrobenthos from the KC and SA habitats as compared with the TF. In contrast, vascular plant FA markers of macrobenthos were higher in the KC and SA than in the TF, indicating the contribution of mangrove and Spartina detritus to the consumers. The findings show that the food sources of macmbenthos were markedly affected by non-indigenous plants, through the addition of organic detritus derived from vascular plants in the diets together with a decreased contribution of diatoms, although the impacts may differ among different functional feeding groups of macmbenthos.

AB  - Near-bed suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was measured at the margin and in the interior of a Spartina alterniflora marsh in Luoyuan Bay, a semi-enclosed embayment sheltered from the East China Sea, in January and July 2008. Variations in SSC at the two stations correlated to the tidal cycle: high SSC occurred in the early stage of the flood tide and the later stage of the ebb tide, while SSC was significantly lower at all other times. The SSC increased from the neap tide to the spring tide in both winter and summer. The high SSC in winter was primarily a result of stronger hydrodynamic processes, whereas the high SSC in summer was primarily attributable to biological activity. The particulate organic carbon (POC) in the S. alterniflora marsh of Luoyuan Bay primarily originates from freshwater and marine algae and phytoplankton, while the contribution of marsh detritus is limited. The contribution of POC to near-bed SSC is less than 5% in both winter and summer. During winter, the near-bed SSC was closely related to the bottom shear stress; therefore, variations in SSC were controlled by hydrodynamic processes. However, the correlation between bottom shear stress and near-bed SSC was poor in summer because of the interference of burrowing organisms during the late stage of the ebb tide. The maximum estimated contribution of turbid water flowing out of caves due to the biological activity of burrowing organisms was approximately 30.3 mg L-1 or 20.2 to 50.5% with a mean value of 34.9% of total SSC at the late stage of the ebb tide. Our findings also suggest that the relative importance of hydrodynamic processes and biological activity can vary considerably between seasons.

AB  - In the western Atlantic region, the contribution of mangrove food sources to fish diets has been considered of more limited importance than previously expected due to the proximity of mangroves to adjacent potential food sources such as those in seagrass beds. To investigate the influence of different types of mangrove habitats on the relative contribution of mangrove and seagrass food sources in fish diets, four mangrove habitats adjacent to seagrass beds were studied in Florida and Belize using gut-contents and stable-isotope analyses: mangrove fringe forests, basin mangrove, mangrove ponds and overwash mangrove islets. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of 41 fish taxa and an array of potential primary (microphytobenthos, litter, seagrass leaves and their epiphytes, algae, plankton) and secondary (benthic invertebrates) prey were analyzed with SIAR mixing models to examine food source contributions in fish diets relative to habitat type. In all study sites, delta C-13 values of mangrove prey were significantly depleted relative to those from seagrass beds, allowing stable isotopes to provide reliable insights about origins of fish food. Seagrass prey located near basin mangroves in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, Florida) had more negative delta C-13 signatures than seagrass prey adjacent to fringing mangroves of the Florida Keys, suggesting that seagrass from the IRL incorporated dissolved inorganic carbon from mangroves. Contributions of mangrove and seagrass prey to fish diets were influenced by type of mangrove habitat and fish residency status. Resident species significantly relied on mangrove prey, whereas only four transients foraged in mangroves. Most transient fishes occurring in basin and fringing mangroves actively foraged in nearby seagrass beds, thus reinforcing the limited role of mangroves as fish foraging habitat for transient species. However, a shift in fish diet was observed for transient species from mangrove ponds, in which they relied on mangrove prey. In overwash mangroves (Belize). the enriched carbon signatures of fishes and the generally higher contributions of seagrass prey to fish diets suggest that fishes derived most of their food from seagrass beds. This trend was particularly highlighted for juvenile reef fishes that shelter in mangroves but forage in nearby seagrass beds. These findings emphasize the importance of considering fish ecology (residency and life status) and type of mangrove habitat when assessing the contribution of mangrove prey to fish food webs in the western Atlantic region.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of biochar from sewage sludge -BSS- and from pruning trees -BPT-(addition dose of 6% d.w.) to immobilise metals in acidic (pH similar to 4.7) and basic (pH similar to 7.4) mine soils under variable flooding conditions, and to determine biochar influence on plant (Sarcocornia fruticosa -Sf-) growth and metal uptake. BSS had lower pH ( similar to 8.2 vs. similar to 9.8), CaCO3 (similar to 71 vs. similar to 85 g kg(-1)), total organic carbon ( similar to 354 vs. similar to 656 g kg(-1)) and higher water soluble organic carbon (WSOC similar to 0.15 vs similar to 0.06 mg kg(-1)) than BPT. PVC columns (15 x 30 cm) were prepared with the following treatments (n = 4): 1) no Biochar-no Sf; 2) no Biochar-Sf; 3) BSS-no Sf; 4) BSS-Sf; 5) BPT-no Sf; 6) BPT-Sf. Changes in water table level (WL) were simulated for 303 days with tap water (upper 0-15 cm alternating flooding-drying conditions, lower 15-30 cm always underwater). The pH, redox potential (Eh), temperature and porewater WSOC, Zn, Cd and Pb concentrations were regularly measured, and plants were removed at the end and length, fresh weight and metal concentrations in tissues measured. In the basic soil, there were no consistent evidences that BSS and BPT were effective decreasing porewater metal concentrations and reducing metal uptake in plants. Sf contributed to mobilise Zn, and in less extent Cd, in the upper soil layer, regardless of the type of biochar, and this effect increased with aging. In the acidic soil, BSS and BPT were effective increasing the pH and decreasing porewater metals. BSS increased its efficiency with aging, which can be mainly attributable to the more reduced conditions that induced (lower Eh values) due to its higher WSOC content. Biochar was effective hindering metal mobilisation by Sf and reducing plant's metal uptake (e.g. reduction in roots: similar to 7 fold for Zn, similar to 19-fold for Cd and similar to 2-fold for Pb). BSS was more effective promoting Sf growth (fresh weight) than BPT. Therefore, in relation with the use of biochar from sewage sludge and from pruning trees as soil amendments under flooding-non flooding conditions, we can conclude that it can be a useful option in acidic mine soils for decreasing water soluble metals and improving plant growth. However, in basic mine soils, we have no evidences to support the advantages of using these two types of biochar as amendments. Hence, the use of biochar in metal-polluted wetlands has environmental implications that must be planned for each specific case in order to optimize the positive aspects (wetland as sinks of pollutants) and reduce the drawbacks (wetland as source of pollutants).

AB  - Remnant endangered saltmarsh communities in Australia often occur in urbanised estuaries where industrial processes have contaminated sediments with metal(loid)s. Despite this issue, virtually nothing is known on local plant species exposure to metal contaminants, nor their ability to uptake and translocate metal(loid)s from contaminated estuarine sediment. In the current study, we assessed the accumulation and partitioning of the metal(loid)s Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd and Se in the dominant saltmarsh primary producer, Sporobolus virginicus, across three urbanised estuaries in NSW Australia. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, while Sydney Olympic Park, Port Jackson exhibited intermediate metal(loid) loadings and Hunter Wetlands exhibited the lowest loadings among estuaries. Essential metals (Zn and Cu) were more mobile, with sediment:root bioconcentration factors (BCFs) greater than unity and translocation among plant organs greater than, or equal to, unity. Other metal(loid)s were less mobile, with BCFs equal to unity and translocation factors among organs much reduced. Despite these barriers to translocation, all metal(loid)s were accumulated to roots with dose, and further accumulative relationships between metal(loid)s in roots and culms, and culms and leaves, were evidenced (with the exception of Cu). Along with sediment metal(loid)s, increases in sediment pH predicted Cu uptake in roots and increases in soil organic matter predicted Se uptake in roots. Although significant positive linear relationships were observed between sediment metal (loid)s and plant organ metal(loid)s(withholding Cu), the variance explained was low to intermediate for most metal(loid)s suggesting employing S. virginicus as an accumulative bioindicator would be impractical.

AB  - Magnetic measurements were carried out on samples from two saltmarshes deposited during the last century on the north-west coast of Ireland. Based on profiles from cliffed saltmarsh edge, mid-marsh and supratidal locations, the processes that affect the generation and persistence of magnetic properties in environments were investigated. This was done to help in understanding the geochemical processes affecting north-west Irish coast saltmarshes and to determine the frequency and provenance of sediment-laden flooding events; hence, disentangling the importance of elastic and organic contributions to saltmarsh growth. Magnetic properties indicate depositional and postdepositional effects varying on both temporal and spatial scales. The interpretations presented here suggest that both biogenic and diagenetic processes have a strong effect on the magnetic properties recorded: in the former case, the growth of magnetotactic bacteria is the main process; in the latter case, it is reductive diagenesis, associated with organic matter decomposition, that is important. The biogenic and diagenetic effects overprint and degrade the detrital magnetic signatures respectively. This suggests that magnetic measurements within the context of north-west Irish coast saltmarshes can provide limited information on elastic sediment input to these environments. Comparisons between sites on the north-west coast of Ireland show similar magnetic properties, despite differences in deposition rates, implying that significant post-depositional alteration of magnetic properties occurs within the first 20-40 years after deposition. Magnetic properties of north-west coast Irish saltmarshes are put into a regional context by comparison with magnetic profiles from similar sites.

AB  - Sesarmid crabs play an important role in organic matter and carbon cycling of mangrove forests. Visual observations and gut content studies have verified that sesarmid crabs are feeding on mangrove leaves, yet stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (C-13 and N-15) have indicated that leaf litter is not assimilated as a food source. Sesarmid crabs tend to be much more enriched in C-13 than leaf litter (0.9 parts per thousand-11.6 parts per thousand) and have C values that are often more like microphytobenthos (MPB). General C-13 trophic enrichment factors (TEF; 0.1 parts per thousand-0.5 parts per thousand) suggest crabs feed more heavily on MPB. Field and laboratory-based evidence reveal that general C-13 TEF for crabs feeding on mangrove leaves may be incorrect and much greater than 0.1 parts per thousand-0.5 parts per thousand. A food web study conducted annually over 2 yrs revealed a shift in the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of Parasesarma sp. crabs similar to mangrove leaves also sampled. This suggested Parasesarma sp. may be feeding more heavily on mangrove leaves than previously reported despite crabs being 4.4 parts per thousand-11.6 parts per thousand more enriched in C-13 than mangrove leaves. A laboratory feeding study confirmed that average C-13 TEF between Parasesarma sp. and decayed Rhizophora sp. leaves was 3.3 parts per thousand (SE 0.5). The Stable Isotope Analysis in R package (SIAR) used with our TEF and the general 0.5 parts per thousand C-13 TEF revealed that published TEFs may underestimate mangrove leaf contributions to sesarmid crab diets on average by 33.3% (SE 0.1) and overestimate MPB and epiphytic algal contributions by 31.3% (SE 0.1). Food web studies in mangroves and other ecosystems will continue to inaccurately identify important food resources or food web structures unless more accurate and species-specific isotope fractionation values are determined.

AB  - Total concentrations and chemical forms of metals in surface sediments of the Vigo Ria (NW Iberian Peninsula) were determined following the sequential extraction method proposed by Tessier et at. (1979). Total values ranged from 7 to 14 mu gCo g(-1), 52 to 76 mu gCr g(-1), 18 to 82 mu gCu g(-1), 136 to 209 mu gMn g(-1), 18 to 30 mu gNi g(-1), 24 to 112 mu gPb g(-1), 62 to 185 mu gZn g(-1) and 18 to 34 mg g(-1) for Fe. The distribution of metals is strongly influenced by the presence of urban and industrial centres. A decreasing concentration trend was observed towards (i) the outer-oceanic part of the ria and (ii) the northern shore in the middle part. Cobalt, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni were found to be strongly associated with the residual fraction of the sediment (65-78%), whereas Cu is significantly present in the oxidisable phase (34-72%) and Pb and Zn are found in both the reducible (14-49%) and the oxidisable (14-39%) phases. The speciation patterns reflect natural uncontaminated conditions in the outer part of the ria. However, a significant fraction of the Cu, Ph, and Zn in the sediments of the southern margin of the middle part of the ria, which supports most of the population and industrial activities, is present in labile forms, so a potential pollution risk may exist.

AB  - Pyrite (FeS2) and iron monosulfide (FeS) play a central role in the sulfur and iron cycles of marine sediments, They may be buried in the sediment or oxidized by O-2 after transport by bioturbation to the sediment surface. FeS2 and FeS may also be oxidized within the anoxic sediment in which NO3-, Fe(III) oxides, or MnO2 are available as potential electron acceptors. In chemical experiments, FeS2 and FeS were oxidized by MnO2 but not with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide (Schippers and Jorgensen, 2001). Here we also show that in experiments with anoxic sediment slurries, a dissolution of tracer-marked (FeS2)-Fe-55 occurred with MnO2 but not with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide as electron acceptor. To study a thermodynamically possible anaerobic microbial FeS, and FeS oxidation with NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide as electron acceptor, more than 300 assays were inoculated with material from several marine sediments and incubated at different temperatures for > 1 yr. Bacteria could not be enriched with FeS2 as substrate or with FeS and amorphous Fe(III) oxide. With FeS and NO3-, 14 enrichments were obtained. One of these enrichments was further cultivated anaerobically with Fe2+ and S-0 as substrates and NO3- as electron acceptor, in the presence of (FeS2)-Fe-55, to test for co-oxidation of FeS2, but an anaerobic microbial dissolution of (FeS2)-Fe-55, could not been detected. FeS2 and FeS were not oxidized by amorphous Fe(III) oxide in the presence of Fe-complexing organic compounds in a carbonate-buffered solution at pH R. Despite many different experiments, an anaerobic microbial dissolution of FeS2 could not be detected; thus, we conclude that this process does not have a significant role in marine sediments. FeS can be oxidized microbially with NO3-, as electron acceptor. O-2 and MnO2, but not NO3- or amorphous Fe(III) oxide, are chemical oxidants for both FeS2 and FeS.

AB  - The roles of several trophic groups of organisms (methanogens and sulfate- and nitrate-reducing bacteria) in the microbial degradation of methanethiol (MT) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) were studied in freshwater sediments. The incubation of DMS- and MT-amended slurries revealed that methanogens are the dominant DMS and MT utilizers in sulfate-poor freshwater systems. In sediment slurries, which were depleted of sulfate, 75 mu mol of DMS was stoichiometrically converted into 112 mu mol of methane. The addition of methanol or MT to DMS-degrading slurries at concentrations similar to that of DMS reduced DMS degradation rates. This indicates that the methanogens in freshwater sediments, which degrade DMS, are also consumers of methanol and MT. To verify whether a competition between sulfate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria for DMS or MT takes place in sulfate-rich freshwater systems, the effects of sulfate and inhibitors, like bromoethanesulfonic acid, molybdate, and tungstate, on the degradation of MT and DMS were studied. The results for these sulfate-rich and sulfate-amended slurry incubations clearly demonstrated that besides methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria take part in MT and DMS degradation in freshwater sediments, provided that sulfate is available. The possible involvement of an interspecies hydrogen transfer in these processes is discussed. In general, our study provides evidence for methanogenesis as a major sink for MT and DMS in freshwater sediments.

AB  - Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) burial rates were determined within natural saltmarsh (NSM) and 'managed realignment' (MR) sediments of the Blackwater estuary, UK. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured along with their ability to offset a portion of the C burial to give net C sequestration. C and N densities (C rho and N rho) of NSM sediments (0.022 and 0.0019 g cm(-3)) are comparable to other UK NSM sediments. Less vegetationally developed MR sediments have lower C rho and N rho (0.012 and 0.0011 g cm(-3)) while the more vegetationally developed sites possess higher C rho and N rho (0.023 and 0.0030 g cm(-3)) than NSM. Both NSM and MR areas were small CH4 (0.10-0.40 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and N2O (0.03-0.37 g m(-2) yr(-1)) sources. Due to their large Global Warming Potentials, even these relatively small greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes reduced the net C sequestration within MR marshes by as much as 49%, but by only 2% from NSM. Potential MR areas within the Blackwater estuary (29.5 km(2) saltmarsh and 23.7 km(2) intertidal mudflat) could bury 5478 t C yr(-1) and 695.5 t N yr(-1), with a further 476 t N yr(-1) denitrified. The saltmarsh MR would also sequester 139.4 t P yr(-1). GHG fluxes would reduce the C burial benefit by 24% giving a C sequestration rate of 4174 t C yr(-1). Similar areas within the Humber estuary (74.95 km(2)) could bury 3597 t C yr(-1) and 180 t N yr(-1), with a further 442 t Nyr(-1) denitrified. GHG fluxes would reduce the C burial benefit by 31% giving a C sequestration rate of 2492 t C yr(-1). Overall, MR sites provide sustainable coastal defence options with significant biogeochemical value and, despite being net sources of CH4 and N2O, can sequester C and reduce estuarine nutrient loads.

AB  - Methane is a greenhouse gas of largely biological origin. Micro-organisms responsible for production of much of the atmospheric methane are directly affected by climate resulting in potential feedbacks between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Our current understanding of the role of methane in the climate system is reviewed in this article, with a brief discussion of biological, chemical, and physical processes responsible for the spatial and temporal distribution of atmospheric methane. The magnitude of most methane sources is highly speculative, and their distributions are qualitatively understood. Most terrestrial source regions have been surveyed, but few have been studied in much derail. The strength of enteric sources is based on laboratory measurements of emissions from a few animals and estimates of global populations. Accuracy of the resulting flux size and distribution is highly suspect. Data available on either magnitude or distribution of non-biogenic methane sources are scarce. Models of the influence of climate on biological methane sources are primarily regressions dependent on measures of heat and water in the environment. Process-based models derived from biological and physical principles are called for in order to address environmental conditions unlike the present.

AB  - 1. Facilitation of foundation species is critical to the structure, function and persistence of ecosystems. Understanding the dependence of the strength of this facilitation on environmental conditions is important for informed ecosystem management and for predicting the impacts of global change. In coastal seagrass habitats, chemosymbiotic lucinid bivalves can facilitate seagrasses by decreasing potentially toxic levels of sulphide in sediment porewater. However, variation in the strength of lucinid-seagrass facilitation with environmental context has not been experimentally investigated.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of the tiger lucine Codakia orbicularis becomes more important to the growth and survival of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum under decreased light availability and increased sulphide stress. In a mesocosm experiment, we reduced average ambient-light to T. testudinum by 64% and/or increased sediment porewater sulphide concentrations by similar to 200% and compared growth and tissue chemistry of T. testudinum with and without C. orbicularis.
   3. We found that T. testudinum was better able to maintain growth under shading and sulphide stress when C. orbicularis was present. C. orbicularis strongly decreased sediment porewater sulphide, an effect that minimized sulphur build-up in seagrass tissue and was likely achieved through bioirrigation as well as chemoautotrophy. The relative effects of C. orbicularis on T. testudinum growth were strongest in the presence of environmental stressors.
   4. Synthesis. The strength of lucinid-seagrass facilitation increases under environmental conditions that hinder the ability of seagrass to detoxify sulphide. Our results provide evidence of a potential mechanism by which the spatiotemporal association between lucinids and seagrasses is maintained and support the incorporation of interspecific facilitation into conservation and restoration strategies for foundation species in the face of increasing anthropogenic impact and global change.

AB  - Introducing nonnative species as a restoration strategy has been widely implemented to rehabilitate coastal ecosystems. Nonnative species becomes an important factor influencing soil physicochemical patterns. Although these effects have been explored individually, the comprehensive examination of soil physicochemical attributes that indicate possible processes of coastal soil resilience or degradation induced by nonnative species has been less emphasized. To expand such understanding, we used a space-for-time substitution methodology to capture characteristics of soil physicochemical attributes and plant productivity in space and time, and further, we used a structural equation model (SEM) to evaluate a set of hypotheses about positive effects of plant invasion (Spartina alterniflora) on soil resilience in terms of soil degradation processes (fertility, salinization, acidification, alkalization, structure, and erosion) in the east-central China coast. SEM analyses revealed 3 aspects of soil degradation that appear to be improved by the exotic S.alterniflora: (a) fertility, (b) desalinization, and (c) erosion resistance. SEM also presented that soil alkalization had occurred with the invasion, indicating the possible decreased capacity of soil against degradation. Although soil became more alkaline, these findings highlight that in the absence of native species, the nonnative species has an overall positive effect on soil resilience against degradation. The connections between nonnative species and soil degradation observed in SEM verified the hypothesized causal relationship, suggesting the significant role nonnative species plays in maintaining soil resilience in regions without native species.

AB  - Surface water concentrations of dissolved nutrients and phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) were examined monthly in relation to physicochemical characteristics and rainfall for 30 months in two tropical, tidally dominated mangrove creeks in north Queensland, Australia. Dissolved nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass peaked during summer with no or little significant change throughout the rest of the year. Dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations correlated inversely with salinity changes, implying that fresh water and suspended material from the watershed were the main source of dissolved nutrients. The mean dissolved inorganic N : P ratio in each creek (Control Creek 58 : 1, Sandfly Creek 26 : 1) was greater than the Redfield ratio (16 : 1), suggesting excess nitrogen relative to phosphorus. Variability in phytoplankton biomass did not correlate significantly with dissolved nitrogen or phosphorus concentrations, but did relate to rainfall patterns and changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. These results suggest that pelagic conditions in these mangrove creeks are constant all year round, except during the summer wet season.

AB  - Saltmarshes, wetlands, inter-tidal mudflats are highly productive natural ecosystems with significant ecological value. Pb-210 and Cs-137 have been used for establishing chronologies at a centennial scale in these sediments. They are relevant for assessing how saltmarshes are vulnerable to climate change, natural hazards and contamination from human inputs. This paper aims to review and adapt existing methods for the Pb-210-based radiometric dating of these sediments where the subterranean production and decay of OM are sources of achronicity. This limits the use of the basic assumption of considering the sediment as a continuous medium. From the available evidence, Pb-210 fluxes onto sediments may be mediated by the activities bound to the mass flows, suggesting that models assuming a constant flux should be handled with care. The activity concentrations of excess Pb-210 required by CF-CS, CIC and TERESA radiometric models must be those of the sediment mineral fraction, while CRS and PLUM can work with the composite sediment matrix. A review of these issues and application of the models is illustrated with new data from two recent saltmarsh sediment cores. The effects of non-ideal boundary conditions in radiometric dating and the system time-average of Cs-137 fluxes are discussed. Although specific to vegetated saltmarshes, this topic and the present results have generic applications for other vegetated coastal sediments.

AB  - This study examined the microbial dynamics associated with decomposing litter of the widespread emergent macrophyte Phragmites australis in a Littoral reed stand of a large lake. Standing dead leaf and stem litter were collected, placed into fine and coarse mesh litter bags, and submerged in the reed stand. Litter bags were retrieved periodically and analyzed for fungal and bacterial biomass, fungal growth rates and production, rates of microbial respiration, litter mass loss, nutrient concentrations (N and P), and rates of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. Microbial biomass associated with both leaf and stem litter (12 to 85 mg C g(-1) detrital C) was predominantly fungal (always greater than or equal to 90 % of the total biomass), even though bacterial biomass (0.13 to 5.6 mg C g(-1) detrital C) increased and fungal biomass decreased or remained constant as litter decay proceeded. Although rates of fungal growth (0.02 to 0.08% h(-1)) and production (leaves only; 3 to 51 mug C g(-1) detrital C h(-1)), and rates of microbial respiration (11 to 257 mug C g(-1) detrital C h(-1)) decreased following litter submergence, fungi continued to be metabolically active in both leaf and stem litter. Significant differences in fungal and bacterial biomass, fungal production rates, and rates of respiration were observed between leaf and stem material, with leaves often having 5 times higher values than corresponding stems. Rates of mass loss differed significantly between leaf Litter in fine and coarse mesh bags, with less than 10% of the initial mass remaining in coarse mesh bags after 86 d, versus nearly 60 % remaining in fine mesh bags. Nitrogen and P concentrations of leaf litter enclosed in fine mesh bags increased during litter decay, whereas N concentrations of leaf litter in coarse mesh bags remained unchanged and P concentrations decreased. Both N and P concentrations of stem litter were similar among litter bags and varied little throughout the study period. Results obtained in this study indicate that significant changes in microbial colonization and activity associated with P, australis litter can occur following the collapse of standing dead plant matter to the water. Furthermore these findings suggest that fungi are active on submerged litter and thus play a vital role in the decomposition of P. australis litter in the aquatic environment.

AB  - Consumption processes at several trophic levels tend to converge in the central (estuarine-mixing) region of the Columbia River estuary, where living and detrital food resources are entrained within the energy null of the turbidity maximum zone.  Primary consumers in this region are generalist and omnivorous feeders, capable of exploiting both autotrophic and heterotrophic food web pathways.  In the presence of higher standing stocks of their prey resources, feeding by secondary and tertiary consumers is also concentrated, or more effective, in the estuarine mixing region of the estuary.  During the 1980-81 studies of the estuary, total consumer (metazoan) production averaged 5.5g C m-2 within the estuary.  Of the estimated 15 x 10(3)mt C y-1 attributed to primary consumption in the water column, 83% was the result of suspension-feeding pelagic zooplankton.  In comparison to grazing on phytoplankton, it was estimated that approximately 84% of primary consumption in the water column was based on suspended detritus and, presumably, associated microbiota.  Endemic primary consumers, principally epibenthic crustaceans such as the calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis, the harpacticoid copepod Scottolana canadensis, and the crangonid shrimp Crangon franciscorum, accounted for a high proportion of the consumption of suspended particles.  Wetland herbivores inhabiting the estuary's extensive marshes, on the other hand, were estimated to account for only 2 to 17% of total estuarine primary consumption.  Trophic linkages to secondary and tertiary consumers were more evenly apportioned among pelagic fishes, motile macroinvertebrates, and benthic infauna.  High, comparatively unknown fluxes of migratory or wide-ranging teritiary consumers, such as piscivorous birds, seals and sea lions, made estimation of their annual consumption rates in the estuary highly tenuous.  The physical processes of mixing and stratification, sediment accretion and erosion, and salinity intrusion appear to be the fundamental determinants of consumption processes in the Columbia River estuary, and perhaps in other similarly energetic estuarine systems, by promoting concentrations of consumers in low-energy habitats such as the turbidity maximum and peripheral bays.

AB  - Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in subtidal sediments of Tomales Bay, California, were variable by sediment type, season and depth. Higher rates were measured in near-surface muds during summer (up to 45 nmol cm-3 h-1), with lower rates in sandy sediments, in winter and deeper in the sediment. Calculations of annual, average SRR throughout the upper 20 cm of muddy subtidal sediments (about 30 mmol S m-2 d-1) were much larger than previously reported net estimates of SRR derived from both benthic alkalinity flux measurements and bay wide, budget stoichiometry (3.5 and 2.6 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively), indicating that most reduced sulfur in these upper, well-mixed sediments is re-oxidized. A portion of the net alkalinity flux across the sediment surface may be derived from sulfate reduction in deeper sediments, estimated from sulfate depletion profiles at 1.5 mmol m-2 d-1. A small net flux of CO2 measured in benthic chambers despite a large SRR suggests that sediment sinks for CO2 must also exist (e.g., benthic microalgae).

AB  - Previous studies have shown that saltmarsh macrophytes have a significant influence on sediment biogeochemistry, both through radial release of oxygen from roots and also via primary production and release of labile organic exudates from roots. To assess the seasonal influence of the needle rush, Juncus roemarianus, on saltmarsh sediment geochemistry, pore waters and sediments were collected from the upper 50 cm of two adjacent sites, one unvegetated and the other vegetated by Juncus roemarianus, in a Georgia saltmarsh during winter and summer. Pore waters collected at 1- to 2-cm intervals were analyzed for pH, alkalinity, dissolved phosphate, ammonium, Fe(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), sulfide, sulfate, and organic carbon. Sediments were collected at 5-cm intervals and analyzed for iron distribution in the solid phase using a two-step sequential extraction. The upper 50 cm of the sediment pore waters are mostly sulfidic during both winter and summer. The pore water and sediment geochemistry suggest organic matter degradation is coupled mostly to Fe (III) and sulfate reduction. In summer, there is greater accumulation of alkalinity, sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate in the pore waters and lower levels of ascorbate extractable Fe, which is presumed to be comprised primarily of readily reducible Fe(III) oxides, in the sediments, consistent with higher organic matter degradation rates in summer compared to winter. Lower pH, alkalinity, ammonium, and sulfide concentrations in sediments with Juncus, compared to nearby unvegetated sediments, is consistent with release of oxygen into the Juncus rhizosphere, especially during summer.

AB  - Little is known regarding potential uptake of metals in Australian saltmarsh flora, thus the current study endeavored to examine patterns of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd uptake and partitioning in the dominant saltmarsh halophyte, Samphire (Sarcocornia quinqueflora), across three contaminated estuaries in New South Wales, Australia. Average sediment concentrations ranged from 62 to 764 mu g/g for Zn, 20-52 mu g/g for Cu, 27-311 mu g/g for Pb and 0.45-1.90 mu g/g for Cd across estuaries. Lake Macquarie was the most contaminated estuary, with the Hunter River estuary and Sydney Olympic Park exhibiting intermediate levels of sediment metal contamination. Bioconcentration factors for metal uptake from sediment to roots were >= 1 (except for Cu). Translocation within the plant was low for most metals, with apparent barriers to transport identified at the root: non-photosynthetic stem interface for Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd, and at the non-photosynthetic stem: photosynthetic stem transition for Pb and Cd. All metals accumulated in roots with increasing sediment exposure, and lower soil organic matter predicted greater Pb and Cu uptake to roots. Further, increases in sediment pH predicted greater Cd root accumulation. However, transport was regulated to the non-photosynthetic stem for Zn, and to the PS stem for Zn and Pb. In terms of employing S. quinqueflora as a bioindicator, all root metals, and Pb and Cd in non-photosynthetic stem tissue exhibited relationships with sediment metal loads, though high variability made their predictive ability limited.

AB  - Contemporary and relict (subsurface) intertidal foraminiferal dead assemblages were collected from a site near to Cocoa Creek, north Queensland, Australia, and analysed for the purpose of understanding fossil assemblage development and preservation. A marked dichotomy was identified between dead foraminiferal assemblages within mangrove sediments and those within adjacent mudflat sediments. Mangrove assemblages were almost exclusively represented by agglutinated species (mainly Arenoparrella mexicana, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Milliammina fusca, M. obliqua, Trochammina inflata) while calcareous species dominated the mudflat (mainly Ammonia aoteana, Pararotalia venusta, Parrellina hispidula). Surface and subsurface test abundances were also an order of magnitude greater within mudflat sediments (1000-3000 tests per cm(3)) than in the sediments beneath the mangroves (100-300 tests per cm(3)). Statistically significant differences in the abundance of calcareous and agglutinated tests between wet and dry seasons within the mangrove suggest that tests are systematically lost from this part of the system on an annual basis.
   A model of assemblage formation under shoreface progradation is presented which makes a direct link between surface assemblages, post-depositional processes and the composition and environmental resolution of the fossil assemblages entering the stratigraphic record. Assemblages within the mangrove undergo rapid taphonomic loss and are then overprinted during burial by the deep infaunal communities associated with the prograding higher-elevation environments. As such, much of the eventual mangrove sequence is represented entirely by assemblages produced relatively recently within an upper mangrove environment, and therefore cannot be differentiated according to elevation at the time of deposition. In addition, organic enrichment of upper mudflat deposits by mangrove roots, which occurs during progradation, results in the dissolution of calcareous tests from an similar to 40 cm thick stratigraphic interval. It is argued that in order to reliably recognise the changes to foraminiferal assemblages which occur during burial, assemblages must be compared with respect to stratigraphy, rather than reflexively downcore.

AB  - We used natural abundance measurements of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and a short-term N-15-enrichment experiment to explore the importance of river-derived and autochthonous sources to the diet of intertidal suspension-feeding bivalves in the Ria de Arosa, an oceanic-dominated system in northwest Spain. Highly seasonal and intense phytoplankton "bloom'' events occur in this estuary. However, relatively low phytoplankton standing crop and productivity are present during much of the year, suggesting that food sources other than phytoplankton must support bivalves during these periods. Bivalves (Cerastoderma edule, Tapes decussatus, Mytilus galloprovincialis) were sampled quarterly at four intertidal stations along the length of the estuary with increasing distance from the Ulla River. Muscle tissue was consistently enriched in C-13 and N-15 relative to stomach contents. The stable C isotope values of bivalves indicated that river-derived inputs were, at most, a minor component of diet. These values suggested the potential importance of benthic microalgae to bivalve diet much of the year and the incorporation of N-15 label applied to the sediment surface into stomach contents and muscle tissue in a field experiment supported this conclusion. Other labeled components of the microbenthos such as bacteria could also have been ingested. C-13-depleted values of bivalves in May coincided with elevated offshore chlorophyll a concentrations, suggesting the increased use of a phytoplankton source during the spring. We propose that intertidal suspension-feeding bivalves in this estuary use primarily resuspended microbenthos during periods of low phytoplankton concentration, but that phytoplankton increases In relative dietary importance during bloom events.

AB  - Seagrass beds are thought to have a fundamental role in maintaining populations of commercially exploited fish and invertebrate species by providing one or more of the following: (a) a permanent habitat, allowing completion of the full life cycle, (b) a temporary nursery area for the successful development of the juvenile stages, (c) a feeding area for various life-history stages and (d) a refuge from predation. In addition to these primary roles, seagrass beds are thought to maintain fisheries indirectly by providing organic matter that is incorporated into coastal nutrient cycles and which supports secondary production, including fisheries species. Unfortunately, these roles have been distilled from a disparate literature that often reports results using different sampling methods, seagrass species, geographical locations and temporal or spatial scales.
   The aims of this review are to summarise the literature assessing the importance of seagrass habitats for fishery species, to highlight possible confounding factors that may help to explain some of the contradictory statements in the literature and to identify areas of seagrass ecology that require further investigation.

AB  - Solid-phase sulfur speciation and stable sulfur isotopic compositions are used to elucidate the formation and burial of pyrite-sulfur (S-py) and organic sulfur (OS) at three selected sites in mud sediments of the East China Sea (ECS) inner shelf, and to infer potential factors influencing the preservation of Spy and OS in the sediments. Our results in combination with previous studies show that the overall reactivity of sedimentary organic matter (OM) is low, while OM at the site impacted by frequent algal-bloom events displays somewhat enhanced reactivity. We observed characteristically low contents of acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and S-py in the sediments, which can be attributed to low sulfate reduction rate due to high redox potential together with limited availability of labile OM. Several geochemical features, for example, persistent occurrence of S-0, good coupling among the profiles of AVS, S-0 and S-py, and large S-34(py) depletion, all suggest that the polysulfide pathway and disproportionation are likely involved in the pyrite formation. Organic sulfur amounts in the sediments are at the lower end of OS contents reported in many other marine sediments around the world. The sources of OS are both biosynthetic and diagenetic, with the biosynthetic OS being the major share (59-73%). In one site studied (C702), enhanced accumulation of OS within the upper layers (14 cm) is believed to be associated with frequent algal-bloom events. Net burial fluxes of S-py and OS in the three sites studied range from 0.27 to 0.82 mmol/m(2)/d and from 0.22 to 0.74 mmol/m(2)/d, respectively. Sedimentation rate and algal-bloom events are two important factors influencing the spatial variability of S-py and OS burial fluxes in the whole shelf. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to partition out the predominant anaerobic respiration pathways coupled to C oxidation and to further elucidate the controls of anaerobic C respiration in three major saltmarsh habitats at Skidaway Island, GA; the short form of Spartina alterniflora (SS), the tall form of S. alterniflora (TS), and unvegetated, bioturbated creek-bank (CB). Geochemical analysis of pore water and solid phase constituents revealed that the SS site experienced highly reducing conditions with two orders of magnitude higher pore water sulfide inventories (1.884 mmol m(-2)) than TS (0.003 mmol m(-2)) and CB (0.005 mmol m(-2)), respectively. Conversely, reactive Fe(III) inventories at TS (2208 mmol m(-2)) and CB (2881 mmol m(-2)) were up to 7-9 times higher than at SS (338 mmol m(-2)). Incubations and intact core experiments indicated that SO42- reduction accounted for 95% (SS), 37%) (TS) and 66% (CB) of total anaerobic respiration. There was no detectable Fe(III) reduction at SS, while Fe(III) reduction accounted for up to 70% of C oxidation in the 3-6 cm depth interval at TS and 0-3 cm depth of CB, and on average, approximately 55% of C oxidation over two-thirds of marsh surface area. Laboratory manipulations provided further evidence for the importance of Fe(III) reduction as the accumulation rates of fermentation products were high when Fe(III) reduction was inhibited by removing the Fe(III) minerals from highly bioturbated CB sediments with higher Fe(III) mineral contents. Anaerobic C oxidation, SO42-- and Fe(III)-reduction rates appeared to be highest at the TS site during active plant growth in summer. Overall results suggest that bioturbation by macrofauna is the overriding factor in modulating the pathway of C mineralization in the saltmarsh, whereas availability of organic substrates from plants is a key factor in controlling the C oxidation rate.

AB  - Salt accumulation gradually changes the cycling of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and may even transform sinks into sources in arid wetlands. However, it's not clear how hydrochemical characteristics affect the wetland's source or sink function or how they affect C, N, and P cycling in arid regions. To clarify these relationships, we conducted field measurement in arid northern China. We simulated the variations of hydrochemical characteristics and the storage and stoichiometry of C, N, and P using the process-based DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Hydrus-1D models. The meteorological and hydrological processes had obvious characteristics of seasonal and interannual changes. The measured evapotranspiration averaged 660.23 and 587.94 mm year(-1)in the saltmarsh and riparian wetlands, respectively. The soil showed a clear trend with higher SO42-, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl(-)fractions in comparison with lower Mg2+, K+, and HCO(3)(-)fractions, with the major ion and nutrient concentrations gradually decreasing with increasing depth in the soil. The major ion types had characteristics of Na+-Ca2+-SO42--Cl(-)in the saltmarsh wetland and riparian wetland. The storage of total C, N, and P were 372.72 +/- 66.52 t C/hm(2), 10.92 +/- 2.59 t N/hm(2), and 17.55 +/- 1.54 t P/hm(2)in the saltmarsh wetland versus 119.72 +/- 27.88 t C/hm(2), 4.38 +/- 1.24 t N/hm(2), and 13.17 +/- 1.46 t P/hm(2)in the riparian wetland. Therefore, wetland salinization in our study led to increased soil C, N, and P contents and storage and thereby enhanced the sink function of the wetlands.

AB  - Human activities in coastal areas frequently cause loss of benthic macrophytes (e.g. seagrasses) and concomitant increases in microalgal production through eutrophication. Whether such changes translate into shifts in the composition of sediment detritus is largely unknown, yet such changes could impact the role these ecosystems play in sequestrating CO2. We reconstructed the sedimentary records of cores taken from two sites within Botany Bay, Sydney the site of European settlement of Australia to look for human-induced changes in dominant sources of detritus in this estuary. Cores covered a period from the present day back to the middle Holocene (6000years) according to 210Pb profiles and radiocarbon (14C) dating. Depositional histories at both sites could not be characterized by a linear sedimentation rate; sedimentation rates in the last 3050years were considerably higher than during the rest of the Holocene. C:N ratios declined and began to exhibit a microalgal source signature from around the time of European settlement, which could be explained by increased nutrient flows into the Bay caused by anthropogenic activity. Analysis of stable isotopic ratios of 12C/13C showed that the relative contribution of seagrass and C3 terrestrial plants (mangroves, saltmarsh) to detritus declined around the time of rapid industrial expansion (1950s), coinciding with an increase in the contribution of microalgal sources. We conclude that the relative contribution of microalgae to detritus has increased within Botany Bay, and that this shift is the sign of increased industrialization and concomitant eutrophication. Given the lower carbon burial efficiencies of microalgae (0.1%) relative to seagrasses and C3 terrestrial plants (up to 10%), such changes represent a substantial weakening of the carbon sink potential of Botany Bay this occurrence is likely to be common to human-impacted estuaries, and has consequences for the role these systems play in helping to mitigate climate change.

AB  - The bottom of the Red Sea harbors over 25 deep hypersaline anoxic basins that are geochemically distinct and characterized by vertical gradients of extreme physicochemical conditions. Because of strong changes in density, particulate and microbial debris get entrapped in the brine-seawater interface (BSI), resulting in increased dissolved organic carbon, reduced dissolved oxygen toward the brines and enhanced microbial activities in the BSI. These features coupled with the deep-sea prevalence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in the global ocean make the BSI a suitable environment for studying the osmotic adaptations and ecology of these important players in the marine nitrogen cycle. Using phylogenomic-based approaches, we show that the local archaeal community of five different BSI habitats (with up to 18.2% salinity) is composed mostly of a single, highly abundant Nitrosopumilus-like phylotype that is phylogenetically distinct from the bathypelagic thaumarchaea; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were absent. The composite genome of this novel Nitrosopumilus-like subpopulation (RSA3) co-assembled from multiple single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from one such BSI habitat further revealed that it shares similar to 54% of its predicted genomic inventory with sequenced Nitrosopumilus species. RSA3 also carries several, albeit variable gene sets that further illuminate the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic plasticity of this genus. Specifically, it encodes for a putative proline-glutamate 'switch' with a potential role in osmotolerance and indirect impact on carbon and energy flows. Metagenomic fragment recruitment analyses against the composite RSA3 genome, Nitrosopumilus maritimus, and SAGs of mesopelagic thaumarchaea also reiterate the divergence of the BSI genotypes from other AOA.

AB  - Water. sediments. and aquatic biota were sampled in a tidal river-marsh on the Potomac River near Washington, DC (USA) to assess baseline concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bioaccumulation in finish species. The mean sediment total-PCB concentration in the wetland was 50 ng/g dry weight. and mean concentrations in biota ranged front 150 ng/g to 450 ng/g wet weight. The highest PUB concentrations were observed in channel catfish. The median biotasediment accumulation factor (BSAF) estimated in all finfish species for total-PCBs was 2.9. However. some of the individual and co-eluting PCB congeners had median BSAFs that were substantially greater (e.g., congener numbers 42. 74, 182/187/128, and 171) or lower (e.g., congener numbers 18/15, 45, 185, and 208) than the total-PCB average. Apparent bioaccumulation factors (biota/water PCB concentration ratios) for PCB congeners showed a parabolic relation with n-octanol/water partition coefficients. confirming some previous investigations. There was no clear trend between apparent bioaccumulation factors and trophic level, Organic-carbon-normalized sediment distribution constants (sediment/water PCB concentration ratios) were linearly related to the apparent bioaccumulation factors for all the finfish species investigated.

AB  - We examine the potential for diurnal variation in elevation of saltmarsh surfaces as a source of error in long-term experiments; errors particularly critical in high precision studies that employ the surface elevation table (SET) as a means to monitor elevations. The field study was carried out along the New Brunswick coast of the Bay of Fundy in high and low zones at three marshes with different tidal ranges. We used a total of 16 benchmark pipes and controlled for daily variability in evapotranspiration (ET), as well as timing of tidal flooding, two factors that affect soil water storage, and consequently soil volume. In six of nine trials we detected significant elevation change over periods as short as 5 d. Marsh-wide averages ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 rum, greater than the yearly increase in relative sea level in many regions. Wood Point marsh had the highest tidal range, but lowest soil organic matter content, giving its soils the lowest compressibility and little sensitivity to ET during two of three trials; the average change in elevation in Wood Point high marsh stations was 4.0 mm during the last trial. Greater differences later in the growing season (while temperature changes were minor) at Wood Point and another site suggest that plant transpiration drove changes in water storage at those sites. Significantly greater differences in elevation with lower plant cover in the third marsh suggests that evaporation drove changes in water storage there. Surface elevation change due to ET should be of greatest concern to SET users in temperate regions where there are large changes in plant biomass and variable temperatures. Variation due to plant transpiration could be reduced if yearly monitoring is scheduled before the start of the growing season.

AB  - Fertilizers have been largely responsible for the massive increases in world food production in the past half century that permitted accelerated global population growth to current unprecedented levels. Fertilizer use not only impacts crop yields but also affects animal production. While nitrogen (N) has been the main driver of such changes, phosphorus (P) also has a major role. Like N, the use of P fertilizers can have implications beyond the farmers' fields, if excessive amounts are applied. The past four decades have witnessed overuse of P fertilizers as well as animal manures in the intensive agricultures of some European countries and North America. Yet ironically in many areas of the world, notably Africa, agricultural output is largely constrained by low soil P in combination with little or no P fertilizer application. Rock phosphate is the global source of the raw material for P fertilizer. However, resources are finite, and therefore efficient and wise use is of paramount importance.
   The vast West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region is one where agricultural output is beset with major environmental constraints. Yet fertilizer use in the region is still in the incipient to early development stage, ironically in view of the fact that major deposits of exploitable rock phosphate are found in the region, mainly in Morocco and Tunisia. With the predominantly calcareous soils of the region being inherently low in available P, the main focus in the past few decades has been on promoting P use and its efficient management in rainfed and irrigated agriculture. In the 19605 and 19705, virtually no fertilizer was used in the region, with rapid increases in N and to a lesser extent P since then. The sharp transition from low-input traditional agriculture to conventional modern agriculture has particular implications for efficient P fertilizer use from the economic and environmental standpoints.
   This review seeks to present a broad overview of P in countries of the WANA region, which varies considerably with respect to economic development and the level of agricultural research, education and extension. It presents the background global considerations with respect to P supplies and use, as well the agricultural context for the region, including climate and cropping systems; it draws heavily on research on soils and soil-P chemistry from Spain, which though technically excluded from WANA, has much in common with the Mediterranean region, and highlights P research from Pakistan at the eastern fringes of WANA. It highlights the discrepancy in P use between developed and developing countries such as those of WANA. The review to some extent builds on extensive research carried out in Syria by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), with secondary emphasis on countries of the region, many of which collaborate closely with ICARDA.
   The review covers the past three decades, highlighting progress in field trials on fertilizer use with the region's main crops in relation to rainfall, cropping systems, soil test levels, and efforts to identify P-efficient genotypes and enhance soil P fertility with mycorrhizae. Despite the many isolated, uncoordinated, and often-overlapping, and indeed conflicting, research efforts that have taken place in the region, we have attempted to show a gradual progression in knowledge of P in relation to soils and crops. Developments with regard to P, in the overall framework of agricultural research, have contributed to increased output in the WANA region. Much of the documented research has contributed to the global information on soils of arid and semi-arid regions. Despite achievements in applied research, poorly developed technology transfer systems and weak analytical facilities remain as stumbling blocks to the widespread dissemination of the accumulated knowledge on P use to farmers.

AB  - Estuarine tidal freshwater riparian marshes experience short-term saltwater intrusions (caused by typhoons and hurricanes) and Fe(III) inputs (associated with run-off from upstream basins during rain events). However, the effects of Fe(III) inputs and of simultaneous increases of saltwater and Fe(III) on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and porewater geochemistry of estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands have not yet been studied. This study applied monthly in-situ experimental manipulations of saltwater and Fe(III) additions within a tidal freshwater wetland (the Min River estuary, southeast China) dominated by Sagittaria trifolia, over two years. We examined changes in porewater geochemistry (i.e., SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, and NO3-), ecosystem GHG (i.e., CH4, CO2, and N2O) fluxes, and soil denitrification rates. Short-term saltwater intrusions did not cause a large increase in soil salinity but did decrease CH4 fluxes. Fe(III) additions also greatly decreased CH4 fluxes, however, the combined addition of saltwater and Fe(III) did not have a synergistic effect on the reduction of CH4 emissions. Further, CO2 emissions did not significantly change in response to either the individual or the combined saltwater and Fe(III) additions. Most interestingly, we found that the combined addition of saltwater and Fe(III) led to an increase in N2O fluxes of an order of magnitude compared to the control. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models, our findings suggest that short-term pulses of both individual saltwater and the combination of saltwater and Fe(III) caused by storm fides and soil erosion following a typhoon or hurricane event could reduce the CO2-equivalent flux from subtropical estuarine tidal freshwater wetlands, although the effects may be temporary.

AB  - Aims Among terrestrial ecosystems, coastal sandy dunes are particularly prone to alien plant invasion. Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.
   Methods Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m x 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.
   Important Findings Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between hummock height and depth of inundation in a permanently inundated wetland in south-eastern Australia. Our survey of 318 hummocks, in water ranging from 0 to 70cm depth, revealed a significant positive linear relationship and strong correlation between hummock height and water depth (r(2) = 0.53 and 0.79 for Melaleuca ericifolia and Phragmites australis hummocks respectively). We also investigated whether water regime affects the decomposition rate of litter on hummocks; specifically, whether constant inundation slows decomposition to an extent that would promote accumulation of litter and hummock-building. On the contrary, we found that constantly submerged M. ericifolia litter decomposed faster than dry litter, but at a similar rate to litter that experienced intermittent inundation (decay rates (k) 0.0015 d(-1), 0.0010d(-1) and 0.0008d(-1) for submerged, intermittent and dry treatments respectively). Submerged P. australis litter also decomposed faster (k = 0.0024 d(-1)) than dry litter (k = 0.0011 d(-1)). We discuss the interaction of water regime and decomposition of organic material and implications for the maintenance of hummock and hollow topography. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Separating the effects of anthropogenic changes in freshwater delivery from that of sea level rise on the rate of salt water encroachment in the low relief Southeast Saline Everglades is important for understanding how the Anthropocene Marine Transgression might be best managed. We use stratigraphic and paleoecologic methods to calculate rates of salt water encroachment and biogenic sediment accumulation in the Southeast Saline Everglades. Our results suggest that sea level rise during the last century was accompanied by salt water encroachment, which is ultimately controlled by the elevation of high tide and varied by a factor of 14.8 in the five watersheds studied. These differences are attributed primarily to differences in freshwater delivery. The delivery of freshwater mitigated salt water encroachment in only one of the five watersheds. This difference is attributed to sufficient freshwater delivery to maintain a plant community with more rapid rate of sediment accumulation than other sites. Under conditions of diminishing freshwater availability and increasing rate of sea level rise, our data suggest that little can be done at a scale large enough to prevent loss of the Southeast Saline Everglades within the next 50-200 years.

AB  - Phosphorus, a dominating element responsible for eutrophication, is a potential limiting nutrient in wetland ecosystem. In this study, the release risk of phosphorus was evaluated by investigating the distribution of phosphorus fractions in different grain-sizes of soil aggregates in wetlands with restoration durations of 1, 2, 3, 5, 13 or 19 years. The results showed that the soil aggregate structure tended to be stable when paddy fields were changed into wetland, though aggregate structure first condensed fine aggregates (<0.25 mm) into coarse-aggregates (>0.25 mm), which was then reversed until the process stabilized after 5 restoration years. With the exception of labile inorganic phosphorus (L-Pi), which continuously decreased within extended abandoned period, total phosphorus (TP), labile organic phosphorus (L-Po), moderately labile organic phosphorus (MI-Po), iron-aluminum bound phosphorus (Fe center dot Al-P), calcium-magnesium bound phosphorus (Ca center dot Mg-P), humic phosphorus (Hu-P) and residual phosphorus (Re-P) concentrations presented a unimodal tendency with a peak at the 2nd or 3rd restoration year, respectively. TP, L-Pi, L-Po and Re-P tended to decrease with decreasing soil aggregate grain-size, and MI-Po was enriched in small macro-aggregates (0.25-1 mm) and micro-aggregates (0.053 -0.25 mm). Macro-aggregates carried Fe center dot Al-P and Ca center dot Mg-P. Adsorption isotherm simulation results demonstrated that the retention capacity for phosphorus of a restored wetland first increased and then decreased with extended abandonment period, and macro-aggregates showed a considerable capacity to retain phosphorus. Fe.Al-P and Hu-P had potential release risk with approximate amounts of 197.25 -337.25 mg kg(-1) and 131.28-185.72 mg kg(-1), in associated with anaerobic environment and aggregate structure.

AB  - The littoral zone of Chesapeake Bay contains a mosaic of shallow vegetated and nonvegetated habitats with biotic components that are sensitive to changes in biological and physical driving factors. Static and dynamic modelling frameworks provide an integrative way to study complex hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in linked estuarine habitats. In this study we describe a spatial simulation model developed and calibrated relative to a specific littoral zone, estuarine ecosystem. The model consisted of four distinct habitats that contained phytoplankton, sediment microalgae, Zostera marina (eelgrass), and Spartina alterniflora. There was tidal exchange of phytoplankton, particulate and dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic nitrogen between the littoral zone ecosystem and the offshore channel. Physical exchange and biogeochemical transformations within the habitats determined water column concentrations in each habitat. Predicted subtidal water column concentrations and Z. marina and S. alterniflora biomass were within the variability of validation data and the predicted annual rates of net primary production were similar to measured rates. Phytoplankton accounted for 17%, sediment microalgae 46%, the Z. marina community 24% and S. alterniflora 13% of the annual littoral zone primary production. The linked habitat model provided insights into producer, habitat and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen properties that might not have been evident with stand-alone models. Although it was an intra-ecosystem sink for particulate carbon, the seagrass habitat was a DOC source and responsible for over 30% of the littoral zone carbon and nitrogen primary production. The model predicted that the Goodwin Islands littoral zone was a sink of channel derived POC, but a source of DOC to the surrounding estuary. The framework created in this study of estuarine ecosystem dynamics is applicable to many different aquatic systems over a range of spatial and temporal scales. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Here we provide valuable information about the palaeoenvironmental evolution of Southwestern Mediterranean region during the last ca. 320 ka through a biomarker-based study of the longest continuous continental Quaternary record in the Iberian Peninsula. The n-alkane content and delta C-13 values of these lipids were measured in 300 samples taken from the uppermost 55 m of the Padul Basin (PB) record. The delta C-13 signal of long-chain n-alkanes was a reliable proxy for C-4/C-3 terrestrial vegetation composition in the basin, as emergent macrophytes made a minor contribution to these homologues. In contrast, the delta C-13 values of C-23 and C-25 alkanes reflected mainly phases of increasing water level of the lacustrine/palustrine water body since aquatic macrophytes contain a large proportion of these compounds. Low delta C-13 values were attributed to a marked contribution of plants using the C-3 photosynthetic pathway. Intervals with the lowest delta C-13 values were attributed to an important input of angiosperms, although they could also be explained by changing environmental conditions or environmental stress, as large shifts in delta C-13 occurred in long-chain homologues typically abundant in terrestrial plants. Shifts in delta C-13 of medium-chain homologues reflected limited CO2 availability induced by water temperature, salinity, pH, enhanced productivity, low atmospheric pCO2, or stagnant barriers, rather than the abundance of aquatic macrophytes. Our results also suggest enhanced isotopic fractionation during lipid synthesis by aquatic macrophytes within MIS 7 and the Holocene, leading to increased delta C-13 values of bulk OM and of long-chain n-alkanes. Hence, the delta C-13 logs were ideal for studying the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to the lipid and isotopic composition of sediments and for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions. These results confirmed that C-4 plants had a low presence in the PB. Comparison with biomarker analysis and pollen data of the PB and other records of the Southwestern Mediterranean revealed that delta C-13 values of bulk OM and of long-chain n-alkanes reflected global climatic oscillations during MIS 7 and the episodes Heinrich Events 3, 2, 1 and Younger Dryas.

These reduction reactions affect these cycles on a variety of time scales, ranging from those as short as seasonal time scales (e.g., nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems), to those as long as thousands to tens of thousands of years (e.g., glacial-interglacial transformations in deep sea sediments). In this review article I will briefly summarize the results of laboratory studies on the types of manganese and iron reduction that are known to occur in marine sediments, and then discuss the occurrence of these processes in different sedimentary environments. Particular efforts will be given to examining the rates and mechanisms of sedimentary manganese and iron reduction in relationship to other biogeochemical processes in sediments.

AB  - An integrated emergy and economic evaluation of a 7-step ecological engineering system (7-step EES) located in Jiangsu Province, China was carried out. This 7-step EES was constructed to fully utilize existing S. alterniflora production through a low waste, clean production process and to help control the expansion of this invasive grass. First, the above ground S. alterniflora biomass removed for invasion control is used as the feedstock for the extraction of a bio-mineral liquid and its encapsulation, both of which provide a health supplement to treat gout and angiocardiopathy patients. Next, the residues left after extraction are used as a medium for mushroom cultivation, and then for raising earthworms. Finally, the remaining residues become the main component of a microbe enriched organic fertilizer, which is then returned to the soil. A suite of emergy indices were constructed on multiple temporal and spatial scales to examine the operation of the whole system and its subsystems. The results showed that the temporal sustainability of the 7-step EES was relatively high at different spatial scales, especially at the local scale as indicated by its EISDB (1.55E+03). Full implementation of the 7-step EES for S. alterniflora currently residing on the coast of China can result in a potential economic output that is greater than 2% of the national GDP, with an economic output/input ratio over 29. In addition, the 7-step EES had an environmental loading ratio lower than that of the regional system. Sensitivity analysis showed that decreasing the cost of the purchased inputs needed to make the capsules is the key problem that needs to be solved to optimize the system, both for its sustainability and economic viability, on all spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Determining the concentration and isotopic composition of elemental sulfur in modern and ancient environments is essential to improved interpretation of the mechanisms and pathways of sulfur utilization in biogeo-chemical cycles. Elemental sulfur can be extracted from sediment or water samples and quantified by converting to hydrogen sulfide. Alternatively, elemental sulfur concentrations can themselves be analyzed using HPLC and other methodologies; however, the preparation and analysis times can be long and these methods are not amenable to stable isotopic analysis. Current reduction methods involve the use of costly and specialized glassware in addition to toxins such as chromium chloride or cyanide to reduce the sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. The novel reduction method presented here uses dithiothreitol (DTT) as a less toxic reducing agent to obtain both elemental sulfur concentrations and isotopic composition from the same sample. The sample is dissolved in an aqueous or organic liquid medium and upon reaction with DTT, the elemental sulfur is volatilized as hydrogen sulfide and collected in a sulfide trap using an inexpensive gas extraction apparatus. The evolved sulfide concentrations can easily be measured for concentration, by absorbance spectrophotometery or voltammetry techniques, and then analyzed for sulfur isotopic composition. The procedure is quantitative at > 93% recovery to dissolved elemental sulfur with no observed sulfur isotope fractionation during reduction and recovery. Controlled experiments also demonstrate that DTT is not reactive to sulfate, sulfite, pyrite, or organic sulfur.

AB  - A perfusion technique for measuring nitrogen fixation in the eelgrass rhizosphere was developed and used to investigate the patterns and controls of nitrogen fixation in sediment cores containing live eelgrass Zostera marina plants collected from the Limfjord, Denmark. Detailed temporal and spatial patterns of acetylene reduction were consistent with the hypothesis that heterotrophic nitrogen fixation in the eelgrass rhizosphere is stimulated by organic root exudates derived from plant photosynthesis. Nitrogen fixation activity was approximately 3x higher in vegetated than unvegetated sediments, and showed strong seasonal patterns and differences in light-dark incubations that corresponded to variations in plant productivity. Rates in both the light and dark were lowest in the winter months, and increased steadily through the spring and summer to a peak activity in August that coincided with the maximum eelgrass aboveground biomass. Light-incubated cores had significantly higher rates (25 to 40%) than those incubated in the dark during the growth season, and this difference was greatest during the summer months when plant productivity was highest. Nitrogen fixation activity also showed strong (5-fold) spatial variation with depth in the eelgrass root zone, with highest rates correspondirig to the largest root+rhizome bidmass and correlating with seasonal changes in belowground biomass distribution. Additions of glucose or NH4+ showed that the nitrogen-fixing bacteria were limited by organic substrate and were not sensitive to NH4+ concentrations. Molybdate additions indicated that sulfate reducers were responsible for about 25 % of the nitrogen fixation activity in the eelgrass rhizosphere. Overall, daily nitrogen fixation rates integrated to a depth of 14 cm in the sediment (1 to 6 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) were comparable to rates measured in other temperate seagrass meadows, but were lower than those determined for tropical seagrass beds.

AB  - Elucidating the extent and controls of the routes followed by primary production in marine communities (i.e., consumption by herbivores, decomposition, transportation of plant material beyond the community boundaries referred to as export-or accumulation as biomass or detritus) is essential to understand how much and why they differ in their capacity to fuel secondary production, both within or out of the community, and in their role as sinks in the oceanic carbon budget. Here, using an extensive compilation of published reports, I compare the magnitude of these routes across and within a wide range of community types, including oceanic and coastal phytoplanktonic communities, benthic microalgal communities, coral reef algal beds, macroalgal beds, seagrass meadows, marshes, and mangroves. Furthermore, I examine whether the variability in the magnitude of these routes among and within types is associated with that in the magnitude of primary production. In general, different community types showed similar levels of consumption by herbivores and export, in spite of substantial within-type variability. On the contrary, substantial differences in detritus decomposition and accumulation were found among types: coral reef algal beds and benthic microalgal communities tended to show the highest and lowest levels of decomposition, respectively, whereas marshes and oceanic phytoplanktonic communities tended to show the largest and smallest levels of detritus accumulation. The results also identify primary production as a robust (i.e., applicable to a wide range of environmental conditions and communities) control of the variability in herbivory and decomposition among marine communities. The role of primary production as a control of export and detritus accumulation is generally minor and only restricted to coastal phytoplanktonic and benthic microalgal communities, for export, and marshes and mangroves for detritus accumulation.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, among the most productive ecosystems, are important global reservoirs of carbon (C). Accelerated sea level rise (SLR) and saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands increase salinity and inundation depth, causing uncertain effects on plant and soil processes that drive C storage. We exposed peat-soil monoliths with sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) plants from a brackish marsh to continuous treatments of salinity (elevated (similar to 20ppt) vs. ambient (similar to 10ppt)) and inundation levels (submerged (water above soil surface) vs. exposed (water level 4cm below soil surface)) for 18months. We quantified changes in soil biogeochemistry, plant productivity, and whole-ecosystem C flux (gross ecosystem productivity, GEP; ecosystem respiration, ER). Elevated salinity had no effect on soil CO2 and CH4 efflux, but it reduced ER and GEP by 42 and 72%, respectively. Control monoliths exposed to ambient salinity had greater net ecosystem productivity (NEP), storing up to nine times more C than plants and soils exposed to elevated salinity. Submersion suppressed soil CO2 efflux but had no effect on NEP. Decreased plant productivity and soil organic C inputs with saltwater intrusion are likely mechanisms of net declines in soil C storage, which may affect the ability of coastal peat marshes to adapt to rising seas.

AB  - Evidence from the Severn Estuary demonstrates that this region was exploited by Mesolithic huntergatherer-fishers (Bell, 2007). The potential for future archaeological discoveries (Bell, 2007; Webster, 2007: 273; Bell and Warren, 2013: 39), and the well-preserved palaeoenvironmental evidence in the fine-grained and organic sediments of the Somerset, Avon and Gwent Levels (Hosfield et al., 2007a: 40) makes the area of importance for archaeological study. Small quantities of worked flint have been recovered from the foreshore around Stolford, Porlock and Minehead Bay (Mullin et al., 2009; Canti et al., 1995) implying human activity in the present intertidal zone, which is further enhanced by the suggestion of possible deliberate burning of reed swamps (Jones et al., 2005) similar to that postulated in the Severn Estuary (Brown, 2005; Timpany, 2005; Bell, 2007).
   While considerable research has been carried out within terrestrial and intertidal contexts, remarkably little archaeological work has been undertaken below the mean low water mark (Webster, 2007: 273). The Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary has seen considerable change in sea-level since the Last Glacial Maximum (Long et al., 2002; Philips and Crisp, 2010). Extending our knowledge beyond the intertidal zone is therefore of key importance for understanding the Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic palaeogeography of the region (Hosfield et al., 2007b).
   Developments in the recovery of offshore Holocene peat and sediment sequences now permit the production of multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental datasets and landscape reconstructions from submerged sample sites. This paper uses evidence from three cores, recovered from submarine peat deposits at Hinkley Point, Bristol Channel, UK, to explore the issues and challenges associated with producing radiocarbon chronologies from deeply submerged peat sequences within a marine environment. We emphasise the importance of analysis of multiple sequences to construct robust chronologies for local hydrological change and landscape reconstruction (Edwards, 2006). The need for local evidence is critical if we are to move beyond generalised and potentially misleading models of human environment interaction (Scaife, 2011), because as this case study demonstrates, complex processes and landscape variability might have been features of even highly-localised palaeoenvironments.

AB  - Formation of Fe-sulfides in anoxic horizons of mangrove sediments makes this ecosystem a potential long-term sink for metal contaminants in the intertropical region. Increasing anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas can alter the physicochemical of mangrove sediments by modifying their redox state, affecting directly the rate of Fe-sulfides that mediate accumulation of metal contaminant. Here, we show that isolation from the sea, due to land use planning, directly modify the redox state of mangrove sediments from reducing condition to oxidizing condition, affecting the stability of Ni-accumulating Fe-sulfides. Unusual suboxic/oxic conditions are indeed observed at intermediate depths in these mangrove sediments and favor the oxidative dissolution of Ni-pyrite (Fe1-xNixS2) that initially formed under anoxic/suboxic conditions. This reaction leads to a significant release of aqueous HS-, Fe2+ and Ni2+ at the redox boundary. HS- and Fe2+ oxidize into SO42- and Fe3+ and precipitate as schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)(6)SO4), leading to acidification of the pore-waters. Meanwhile, aqueous Ni2+ is mostly leached downward in the underlying anoxic layers of the sediment where it sorbs at the surface of pyrite and/or incorporates in the structure of newly formed pyrites. These results emphasize the potential of Fe-sulfides for mitigating the impact of the oxidation of former Ni-rich mangrove sediments, as long as the anoxic conditions are preserved at depth. This assumption can be expanded to other divalent metals and should be applicable to a larger set of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

AB  - Sulphate reduction usually leads to the formation and accumulation of authigenic pyrite (FeS2) in organic-rich coastal marine sediments. Iron monosulphides (FeSx) are most often found as a minor constituent of the reduced sulphur pool in these sediments and are believed to be precursor phases which convert to pyrite during early diagenesis. Abnormally high ratios of acid-volatile sulphides (AVS) to pyrite, however, are found in the sediments of the Saguenay Fjord, Canada. The AVS-S:FeS2-S ratio observed throughout the anoxic zone in three sediment cores collected along the main axis of the fjord generally exceeds 1 and reaches values as high as 7 at the head of the fjord. To document and explain this anomaly, solid phase components (AVS, FeS2, S-0, reactive iron (Fe-HCl), C-ORG, and total N) as well as porewater constituents (SO4, Fe, and Mn) were analyzed. Degree of pyritization (DOP) values were low (0.1-11%) and generally decreased toward the mouth of the fjord. In contrast, degree of sulphidization (DOS) estimates were high and reached values of up to 43% at the head of the fjord. These latter values indicate that pyrite formation is not limited by iron availability but a large excess of reactive iron may in fact inhibit the build-up of reduced sulphur (Sigma H2S) in the porewaters as a result of AVS-S precipitation. In the absence of a strong Sigma H2S gradient, slow diffusion to the redox boundary and limited formation of soluble intermediate reduced sulphur species may hinder the conversion of AVS to pyrite.

AB  - Saltmarshes are one of the most productive ecosystems, which contribute significantly to coastal nutrient and carbon budgets. However, limited information is available on soil nutrient and carbon losses via porewater exchange in saltmarshes. Here, porewater exchange and associated fluxes of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the largest saltmarsh wetland (Chongming Dongtan) in the Changjiang River Estuary were quantified. Porewater exchange rate was estimated to be (37 +/- 35) cm/d during December 2017 using a radon (222 Rn) mass balance model. The porewater exchange delivered 67 mmol/(m2 center dot d), 38 mmol/(m center dot d) and 2 690 mmol/(m center dot d) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved silicon (DSi) and DIC into the coastal waters, respectively. The dominant species of porewater DIN was NH4 (>99% of DIN). However, different with those in other ecosystems, the dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentration in saltmarsh porewater was significantly lower than that in surface water, indicating that saltmarshes seem to be a DIP sink in Chongming Dongtan. The porewater-derived DIN, DSi and DIC accounted for 12%, 5% and 18% of the riverine inputs, which are important components of coastal nutrient and carbon budgets. Furthermore, porewater-drived nutrients had obviously high N/P ratios (160-3 995), indicating that the porewater exchange process may change the nutrient characteristics of the Changjiang River Estuary and further alter the coastal ecological environment.

AB  - The macrozoobenthos is an important link of the food web in coastal wetlands. Diet-habitat relationships may significantly depend on qualitative differences and seasonal availability of food sources. Increasing interest has been shown in food web structure altered by non-native plants. In particular, however, a non-native mangrove species from Bangladesh, Sonneratia apetala, has been widely planted in China, but little is known about its possible impact on food sources of macrozoobenthos living in these non-native mangrove forests. Therefore, in this study, we used fatty acid analysis to compare the food sources of one littorinid snail and two grapsid crab species between two native mangrove forests and one non-native S. apetala plantation in the Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve of China. We found that the sediment of all three forests had high diatom and bacteria signals, but low mangrove leaf signals, while the opposite patterns were detected in the three macrozoobenthos. Specifically, the gastropod Littoraria melanostoma relied mainly on mangrove leaves and brown algae as food sources, with significant differences among the three mangrove forests, and showed significant seasonal variation in its diet. The grapsidae species (Perisesarma bidens and Parasesarma plicatum) mainly grazed on mangrove litter, brown and green algae, and occasionally consumed diatoms and bacteria, also showing significant seasonal variation in their diet. Overall, Principle Components Analysis (PCA) of the fatty acid profiles showed a significant overlapping in food sources among the macrozoobenthos living in the non-native and native mangrove forests, but significant seasonal variations in their food sources. This suggests that the planting of non-native S. apetala near original mangrove forests has had little effect on the feeding behavior of macrozoobenthos some 10 years after planting.

AB  - The behaviour of sulphate-reducing microbial community was investigated at the oxic-anoxic interface (0-2 cm) of marine sediments when submitted to oil and enhanced bioturbation activities by the addition of Hediste diversicolor. Although total hydrocarbon removal was not improved by the addition of H. diversicolor, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses based on dsrAB (dissimilatory sulphite reductase) genes and transcripts showed different patterns according to the presence of H. diversicolor which favoured the abundance of dsrB genes during the early stages of incubation. Complementary DNA (cDNA) dsrAB libraries revealed that in presence of H. diversicolor, most dsrAB sequences belonged to hydrocarbonoclastic Desulfobacteraceae, suggesting that sulphate-reducing microorganisms (SRMs) may play an active role in hydrocarbon biodegradation in sediments where the reworking activity is enhanced. Furthermore, the presence of dsrAB sequences related to sequences found associated to environments with high dinitrogen fixation activity suggested potential N-2 fixation by SRMs in bioturbated-polluted sediments.

AB  - The following review is the second part of a two part series on the use of remotely sensed data for quantifying wetland extent and inferring or measuring condition for monitoring drivers of change on wetland environments. In the first part, we introduce policy makers and non-users of remotely sensed data with an effective feasibility guide on how data can be used. In the current review, we explore the more technical aspects of remotely sensed data processing and analysis using case studies within the literature. Here we describe: (a) current technologies used for wetland assessment and monitoring; (b) the latest algorithmic developments for wetland assessment; (c) new technologies; and (d) a framework for wetland sampling in support of remotely sensed data collection. Results illustrate that high or fine spatial resolution pixels (<= 10 m) are critical for identifying wetland boundaries and extent, and wetland class, form and type, but are not required for all wetland sizes. Average accuracies can be up to 11% better (on average) than medium resolution (11-30 m) data pixels when compared with field validation. Wetland size is also a critical factor such that large wetlands may be almost as accurately classified using medium-resolution data (average = 76% accuracy, stdev = 21%). Decision-tree and machine learning algorithms provide the most accurate wetland classification methods currently available, however, these also require sampling of all permutations of variability. Hydroperiod accuracy, which is dependent on instantaneous water extent for single time period datasets does not vary greatly with pixel resolution when compared with field data (average = 87%, 86%) for high and medium resolution pixels, respectively. The results of this review provide users with a guideline for optimal use of remotely sensed data and suggested field methods for boreal and global wetland studies.

AB  - Sediment-water nutrient exchange, oxygen uptake, denitrification (acetylene blockage) and pore water nutrient concentration profiles were measured at intertidal sediment (predominantly silt/clays) sites in the lower estuary of the river Great Ouse, England. Sediments were consistent sinks for NO3- (310 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), mean sites 4 to 9) and O-2 (2800 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), mean sites 4 to 7), sources of NH4+ (270 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), mean sites 4 to 9) but neutral with respect to NO2- and urea. Oxygen uptake was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with seasonal temperature. Nitrate exchange became saturated at NO3- concentrations > 400 mu M, at a rate of about 400 mu mol NO3- m(-2) h(-1). Denitrification accounted annually for 46% of the NO3- exchanged into the sediments and approached asymptotic rates during spring and summer at NO3- concentrations > 400 mu M. Of the total N flux through the sediments, NH4+ efflux accounted for 51%, whilst 49% was converted to gases, compared to >90% in the upper estuary. Freshwater flushing times were calculated for a defined area of the estuary and ranged from 20.5 d in June to 3.25 d in November. Attenuation of the riverine total oxidised nitrogen (NO3- + NO2-) load to the estuary ranged from 1% in the middle of winter to 56 % at the height of summer and annually the sediments denitrified 38.4 Mmol N. Recycling of nitrogen in the sediments, via NO3- ammonification (calculated by difference) and organic ammonification, generated an annual NH4+ efflux of 128 Mmol N, equivalent to 22% of the primary production N requirement in the Wash.

AB  - Estuarine fisheries productivity is dependent upon numerous factors, including the productivity of primary producers supporting the food web and the transport of organic matter derived from those primary producers. In this study, we use stable isotope ratios in a Bayesian mixing model to estimate the contribution of primary producers to fully recruited commercial species in two important estuarine commercial fisheries in south-eastern Australia; the Hunter and Clarence estuaries. The C-4 saltmarsh plant Sporobolus virginicus had the greatest contribution to consumer diet among almost all sites and times (25-95%), though for prawns the presence of seagrass may be exerting some influence on this calculated contribution in the Clarence estuary. Particulate organic matter (POM; 30%) and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM; 39-41%) also contributed significantly to consumer diet. Mangroves and other C-3 sources generally had the lowest contribution to consumers (1-31%). While the exact contributions of each source are uncertain within our Bayesian framework, these results highlight the relatively large role of saltmarsh habitat as a contributor to fishery productivity, especially in estuaries with no seagrasses. Given the anthropogenic threats to saltmarsh habitat, there is potential for loss of fishery productivity with further loss of saltmarsh areal extent.

AB  - Brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) are abundant along the Louisiana coast, a coastline that is heavily influenced by one of the world's largest rivers, the Mississippi River. Stable carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (CNS) isotopes of shrimp and their proventriculus (stomach) contents were assayed to trace riverine support of estuarine-dependent brown shrimp. Extensive inshore and offshore collections were made in the Louisiana coastal zone during 1999-2006 to document shrimp movement patterns across the bay and shelf region. Results showed an unexpectedly strong role for nursery areas in the river delta in supporting the offshore fishery, with about 46% of immigrants to offshore regions arriving from riverine marshes. Strong river influences also were evident offshore, where cluster analysis of combined CNS isotope data showed three regional station groups related to river inputs. Two nearer-river mid-shelf station groups showed isotope values indicating river fertilization and productivity responses in the benthic shrimp food web, and a deeper offshore station group to the south and west showed much less river influence. At several mid-shelf stations where hypoxia is common, shrimp were anomalously N-15 depleted versus their diets, and this delta N-15 difference or mismatch may be useful in monitoring shrimp movement responses to hypoxia.

AB  - Coastal waters are known to emit globally significant quantities of CH4, a potent greenhouse gas, but the potential of the rapid and ongoing human alterations to coastal areas to alter these emissions remains undefined. Here we addressed this gap by quantifying water-to-air CH4 fluxes and delta C-13-CH4 values in sub-tropical estuaries at Low (n = 3), Moderate (n = 2), and High (n = 3) levels of human modification (agricultural land use, wastewater discharge), and sediment-to-water CH4 fluxes from the major benthic habitats in representative Low, Moderate, and High systems. An increase in water-to-air CH4 fluxes from 9.7 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (Low) to 28 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (Moderate) to 47 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (High) was accompanied by a shift from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic production pathways. Unexpectedly, benthic CH4 production, which ranged from -48 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) to +180 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) between habitats, estuaries, and seasons, was not the primary driver of this shift. Sediments produced more CH4 (similar to 600%) than emitted from the Low estuary, similar to 90% of CH4 emitted from the Moderate estuary, but only similar to 9% of CH4 emitted from the High estuary. Instead, a combination of wastewater, groundwater, and apparent water column production caused a similar to 3-fold increase in estuary CH4 emissions. Our findings indicate that human alterations to the source, rate, and pathways of CH4 production are driving a net increase in emissions from estuaries, demonstrating a need to redefine how we quantify 'anthropogenic' CH4 emissions.

AB  - Benthic metabolism (sediment O2 uptake, CO2 production and sulfate reduction) and nitrogen dynamics were studied in a mangrove swamp of the Indus Delta, Pakistan during fall 1990. The mangrove, which is characterized by large salinity fluctuations, has highly variable concentrations of Cl- and SO42- in the sediment porewater. Vertical profiles of these constituents reflect the historical events of salinity changes in the overlying water. Rates Of O2 uptake (both measured directly and estimated from O2 profiles) at intertidal creek banks were generally low and about 2 times higher in air-exposed than in water-covered sediment. The high rates found during air exposure was caused by a reduction in the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer and an increased area of oxic-anoxic interfaces due to drainage of water from large sediment interstices (burrows and cracks in the surface). The frequency and duration of water cover were important determinants for microbial respiration in the sediment, Highest rates during water cover were measured subtidally in creek sediment and lowest rates at intertidal creek bank sites. Desiccation may reduce overall microbial respiration at the creek banks. About half of the CO2 production measured during water cover could be accounted for by sulfate reduction in intertidal sediments, whereas only 18 % of the CO2 production in subtidal creek sediments could be ascribed to sulfate reduction. The remainder may be produced by other respiration processes. The low metabolic activity in the mangrove sediment was partly caused by the refractory nature of sediment detritus (mostly remains from tree leaves and roots). The generally low fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen combined with the low nitrogen content in sediment detritus (C:N almost-equal-to 20) also indicated that nitrogen was a limiting factor for microbial activity in this mangrove swamp.

AB  - Demethylation and cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was measured in three different types of intertidal marine sediments: a cyanobacterial mat, a diatom-covered tidal flat and a carbonate sediment. Consumption rates of added DMSP were highest in cyanobacterial mat slurries (59 mu mol DMSP l(-1) slurry h-l) and lower in slurries from a diatom mat and a carbonate tidal sediment (24 and 9 mu mol DMSP l(-1) h(-1), respectively). Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and 3-mercaptopropionate (MPA) were produced simultaneously during DMSP consumption, indicating that cleavage and demethylation occurred at the same time. Viable counts of DMSP-utilizing bacteria revealed a population of 2x10(7) cells cm(-3) sediment (90% of these cleaved DMSP to DMS, 10% demethylated DMSP to MPA) in the cyanobacterial mat, 7X10(5) cells cm(-3) in the diatom mat (23% cleavers, 77% demethylators), and 9x10(4) cells cm(-3) (20% cleavers and 80% demethylators) in the carbonate sediment. In slurries of the diatom mat, the rate of MPA production from added 3-methiolpropionate (MMPA) was 50% of the rate of MPA formation from DMSP. The presence of a large population of demethylating bacteria and the production of MPA from DMSP suggest that the demethylation pathway, in addition to cleavage, contributes significantly to DMSP consumption in coastal sediments.

AB  - High concentrations of methylmercury in freshwater and marine fish lends an urgency to the problem of how inorganic mercury, the predominant pollutant, is converted to methylmercury in the aquatic environment. Numerous experiments by microbiologists suggest that biotic sediments are major sites for methylation of inorganic mercury and that sulfate-reducing bacteria contribute considerably to methylmercury production. However, the sufficient but low sulfate concentration needed for sulfate-reducing bacteria to produce methylmercury makes it difficult to explain its ubiquitous occurrence in coastal and deep sea marine organisms and sediments. In addition, the high concentration of mercury(II) added to samples allows only mercury-resistant species, which do not predominate in the aquatic environment, to survive. Finally, sterilization methods change chemistry as well as biology, and conclusions based on experiments comparing active and sterile sediments are not definitive. For these reasons there is a strong possibility that abiotic methylation of mercury(II) contributes to the formation of methylmercury. This review emphasizes potential abiotic methylation of mercury(II) by methylcobalamin, methyltin compounds, and humic matter. Although methylcobalamin readily methylates mercury(II) in non-environmental matrices, it is least likely of the three methyl donors because it is not abundant in the aquatic environment. In contrast methyltin compounds (mono-, di-, and trimethyltin) occur in water, biota, and sediments of the marine environment. All three methylate mercury(II) in seawater and may be involved in abiotic methylation. Humic matter is the most promising environmental methylating agent for several reasons. Its concentration in waters and sediments is high. It is associated with the solubility and thus mobility of mercury in freshwaters and marine waters, probably by complexation. In addition, several model studies have shown that humic matter effectively methylates mercury(II) forming methylmercury.

AB  - Exotic species can affect food webs and cause cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. The exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to mangrove forests in eastern Asia. However, limited knowledge is available about the effects of S. alterniflora on the diet of macrobenthic fauna and food webs in mangrove wetlands. The stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of primary producers and 11 common native macrobenthic fauna were examined to determine whether exotic S. alterniflora has become a food source for macrobenthic fauna in a mangrove wetland in Zhanjiang, China. The MixSIR mixing model revealed that exotic S. alterniflora served as a new food source for native macrobenthic fauna, and even as the main food source for many macrobenthic fauna. These findings suggest that this invasive plant is now part of the local benthic food web, i.e., it serves as a nutrient source for macrobenthic fauna in local mangrove wetlands. This study provides strong evidence that invasive plants can contribute to the diet of native consumers and change their diet patterns, ultimately altering the materials entering local food webs.

AB  - Measurements of magnetic properties, total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulphur (TS) were performed on recent tidal flat sediments from the Feng-Xian (FX) and Bei-Bu-Gang (BBG) areas of the Yangtze coast and on Holocene tidal flat sediments from core SL67 from the southern Yangtze delta plain, China. The results indicate that greigite has likely formed in the recent upper and middle tidal flat sediments of cores FX and BBG, which are enriched in TOC and TS. Greigite is also present in association with pyrite in the early to middle Holocene saltmarsh and tidal flat sediments of SL67. The abundance of greigite in the early Holocene basal saltmarsh sediments of core SL67, along with the extremely low values of TS/TOC, suggest the presence of either a limited sulphate supply from seawater or a major terrestrial source of organic matter that decomposed slowly. The presence of greigite in mid-Holocene lower tidal flat sediments that contained low amounts of TOC indicates an upward diffusion of CH4 and H2S from the underlying upper tidal flat sediments. A comparison between the sediments of core SL67 and those of the modern tidal flat suggests that early diagenesis (including selective dissolution and pyritisation) continued after the sediments were buried during the Holocene, resulting in the depletion of soil-derived superparamagnetic (SP) particles and the enhanced magnetic properties because of authigenic greigite. However, antiferromagnetic magnetic minerals have not been altered by early diagenesis. Thus, magnetic parameter hard isothermal remanent magnetisation (HIRM) which preserved the primary magnetic signals reflects fluctuations in the detrital mineral input to the core site and records a two-stage 8.2ka cooling event.

AB  - A field research was undertaken to investigate the effects of saltmarsh restoration and some ecoengineering activities on the climate change impact mitigation and community adaptation in the coastal environment of Sonadia Island, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Two research sites viz., saltmarsh restoration site (SMRS) and impacted site (IP) were selected for this study. Amount of carbon assimilation by saltmarsh plant Porteresia coarctata at SMRS was increased from 165.17 +/- 68.35 to 198.18 +/- 41.32 g/m(2) during the study. The highest carbon assimilation (198.18 +/- 41.32 g/m(2)) was noticed during winter, while the highest biomass (10.47 +/- 0.25 kg/m(2)) was measured from SMRS. Soil compactness, organic matter, organic carbon, field water capacity, plant height, plant biomass and shoot density were found to be significantly (p < 0.05 to 0.01) higher in the SMRS than that of the IS. Seasonal variations of air temperature, water temperature, water pH, water salinity, water transparency, tidal height, inundation period, wave velocity, soil temperature, soil pH, pore water salinity, sedimentation, soil texture particle density, plant height, biomass and shoot density at different significance levels (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01) were noticed throughout the study. Correlation matrix showed that the plant height, biomass and shoot density were positively correlated with sedimentation, and negatively correlated with wave velocity at different significant levels (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01). From the present study, it is evident that SMRS, which was controlled and managed with some artificial inputs not only showed the elevated levels of plant height, biomass, shoot density, sedimentation and carbon assimilation but also exhibited remarkable changes in some of the factors studied rather than impacted site (IS), the findings of which could be helpful for the protection of coastal environment as well as mitigation of climate change impact that will ultimately save the local community from natural calamities in the long run.

AB  - Microfossil analysis (e.g. diatoms, foraminifera and pollen) represents the cornerstone of Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) reconstruction because their distribution in the contemporary inter-tidal zone is principally controlled by ground elevation within the tidal frame. A combination of poor microfossil preservation and a limited range in the sediment record may severely restrict the accuracy of resulting RSL reconstructions. Organic delta C-13 and C/N analysis of inter-tidal sediments have shown some potential as coastal palaeoenvironmental proxies. Here we assess their viability for reconstructing RSL change by examining patterns of organic delta C-13 and C/N values in a modern estuarine environment. delta C-13 and C/N analysis of bulk organic inter-tidal sediments and vegetation, as well as suspended and bedload organic sediments of the Mersey Estuary, U.K., demonstrate that the two main sources of organic carbon to surface saltmarsh sediments (terrestrial vegetation and tidal-derived particulate organic matter) have distinctive delta C-13 and C/N signatures. The resulting relationship between ground elevation within the tidal frame and surface sediment delta C-13 and C/N is unaffected by decompositional changes. The potential of this technique for RSL reconstruction is demonstrated by the analysis of part of an early Holocene sediment core from the Mersey Estuary. Organic delta 13C and C/N analysis is less time consuming than microfossil analysis and is likely to provide continuous records of RSL change. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review highlights the presence and ecological roles of fungi in lakes, and aims to stimulate research in aquatic mycology. In the study of lentic systems, this field is an almost completely neglected topic and, if considered at all, has often been restricted to specific groups of fungi, such as yeasts, filamentous fungi (e.g. aquatic hyphomycetes), or phycomycetes (an obsolete taxonomic category that included various fungal and fungal-like organisms). We document that aquatic fungi are common in various lentic habitats. They play potentially crucial roles in nutrient and carbon cycling and interact with other organisms, thereby influencing food web dynamics. The development and application of molecular methods have greatly increased the potential for unraveling the biodiversity and ecological roles of fungi in lake ecosystems. We searched the literature for reports on all fungi occurring in lake ecosystems. The present study summarizes information on the highly diverse mycoflora in lake micro-habitats and highlights the main processes they influence. We also point out ecological niches of fungi in lakes that have been examined only superficially or ignored completely. We demonstrate that we now have the methodology to perform systematic studies to finally fill in some of the large gaps in this field.

AB  - Saltmarshes have been depleted historically, and cumulative stressors threaten their future persistence. We examined experimentally how nutrient availability (high vs. low) affects the responses of Spartina maritima to increased inundation in two mineral soil types (low vs. medium organic). Increased inundation, one of the effects of accelerated sea level rise, had negative effects on most plant growth parameters, but the magnitude varied with soil and nutrient levels, and between plants from different locations. Average differences between inundation treatments were largest at high nutrient conditions in low organic matter soils. We conclude that saltmarsh vegetation would be more drastically affected by increased inundation in low than in medium organic matter soils, and especially in estuaries already under high nutrient availability. This knowledge enhances the prediction of changes at the foreshore of saltmarshes related to sea level rise, and the development of site-specific conservation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sediment characteristics and vegetation composition were measured in a restored and natural saltmarsh and mudflat at Wallasea Island managed realignment scheme (Essex, UK) from January to December 2007. The similar sediment characteristics in the restored and natural mudflat indicated that the sediment in the restored mudflat was approaching natural conditions. However, the sediment characteristics in the restored saltmarsh were not becoming similar to those in the natural saltmarsh. The sediment moisture content, organic matter content and porosity were lower while the sediment bulk density, salinity and pH were higher in the restored compared to the natural saltmarsh. The dissimilarities were mainly due to differences in the vegetation abundance and organic matter content. Although, 18 months after restoration the restored saltmarsh was only sparsely vegetated and there was no net change in the sediment characteristics, the occurrence of Salicornia europaea L. demonstrated that pioneer saltmarsh vegetation establishment preceded the development of sediment characteristics.

AB  - Previous work has shown freshwater macrophytes from lake Littoral zones to be C-13-enriched compared to the same species collected from fast moving rivers. It is thought that carbon fixation in aquatic plants having thicker, stagnant boundary layers, such as that which occurs within low turbulence lentic systems, will result in more positive delta(13)C values due to greater diffusion resistance and subsequent assimilation of otherwise normally discriminated C-13. The present study confirms this hypothesis by examining 876 algal delta(13)C values collected from the Literature. The average delta(13)C value far benthic algae in lakes was similar to 26 parts per thousand, whereas that for riverine benthic algae was -29 parts per thousand. The greater water turbulence to which planktonic algae are exposed is known to dramatically reduce boundary layer thickness and was found to cause even more severe C-13 depletion, resulting in an average value of -32 parts per thousand. This same effect also operates in coastal environments where the average delta(13)C value for marine phytoplankton was -22 parts per thousand compared to -17 parts per thousand for marine benthic algae. When comparisons were made on an individual study basis, differences of 10 parts per thousand or greater in delta(13)C were observed between planktonic and benthic algae in both oceans and lakes. These algal differences in delta(13)C were found to be substantial enough to be reflected in the delta(13)C values of consumers in marine coastal environments.

AB  - The content of several heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) was determined in sediments and in plants (the halophytes Sarcocornia fruticosa and Limonium vulgare) from two selected saltmarshes located in the Marano and Grado Lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea). This environment has been affected by severe Hg contamination from both industrial and long-term mining activities. In both saltmarshes, Hg content in sediments exceeded the estimated background value (0.13 mu g g(-1)), showing the highest concentrations (13.7 mu g g(-1)) in the eastern sector (Grado Lagoon), the most affected by cinnabar ore extraction. On the other hand, the saltmarsh, located in the Marano Lagoon, showed a higher degree of contamination for As, Cd and Pb, which can be related to industrial sources. The rhizo-sediments of both halophytes reflected the characteristics of the non-vegetated sediment, with higher organic carbon content and similar metal concentrations. Enrichment Factors (EF=[metal](root)/[metal](rhizo-sediment)) for each sediment layer were calculated for both halophytes, showing metal enrichments in the roots and the presence of preferential layers of metal accumulation. Hg showed accumulation (EF>1) in the roots below the 20 cm depth, with higher contents in S. Fruticosa. As and Cd were accumulated by both halophytes, more efficiently by S. Fruticosa, and the same species showed also accumulation of Pb and Zn. Translocation of metals from the roots to the aboveground biomass was investigated by measuring metal contents in shoots and leaves of the two species. With the exception of Cd and Hg, all metals were present in the aboveground biomass, most evidently for Cr in S. Fruticosa and Zn in L. Vulgare, although the presence of the latter in leaves could be due to plant physiology rather than translocation of the contaminant.

AB  - Seasonal phenological dynamics of vegetation hold important clues on ecosystem performance towards management goals, such as carbon uptake, and thus should be considered in projections of their targeted services. However, in wetlands spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to mixing of open water, soil, green and dead vegetation makes it difficult to generalize ecosystem functioning across different regions. Remote sensing observations can provide spatially-explicit, cost-effective phenology indicators; however, little is known about their capacity to indicate the links between wetland ecosystem structure and function. Here we assessed this potential by comparing one-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from satellite products at high (5m; RapidEye) and low (30m; Landsat) spatial resolutions with eddy covariance time series of net carbon exchange, field digital camera (phenocam) greenness and water temperature among three floristically similar restored wetlands in California, USA. Phenological timing differed by wetland site: depending on satellite, the range in site-median start of greening was up to 28 days, end of greening - up to 73 days, start of senescence - up to 79 days, and end of senescence - up to 10 days. Key transition dates from satellite inputs agreed with seasonal changes in net carbon exchange, phenocam greenness and water temperatures, suggesting that phenological contrasts could result in part from site differences in vegetation configuration and litter affecting the exposure of canopy, soil and water to sunlight and thus sub-canopy microclimate and ecosystem functioning. Yet, the agreement between satellite inputs was non-systematic, with the greatest disparities at the more heterogeneous, less vegetated site. Phenological model fitting uncertainty increased with greater spatial resolution, highlighting the tradeoff between the accuracy of representing vegetation and the complexity of local seasonal variation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of satellite-derived phenology to structural and functional heterogeneity of ecosystems and call for more rigorous spatially-explicit analyses to inform assessments of restoration and management outcomes.

AB  - Life on Earth depends on the fixation of inorganic carbon to living matter through the process of photosynthesis The inverse of this process, however, is a series of reactions in which organic matter goes through an oxidation process These proceses are fundamentally carried out in the sediments, where organic matter becomes the driving force behind the great majority of diagenetic reactions In this chapter, we will concentrate on the processes of early diagenesis, which occur only a few hundred meters below the surface level of the sediment, and at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees C The different processes of organic matter oxidation, which implicitly follow specific oxidation pathways that use a sequence of terminal electron acceptors in order of decreasing free energy yield, will produce oxic (presence of measurable O-2) and anoxic zones below the sediment-water interface The general expression for the order of oxidants consumed is O-2 > Mn oxyhydroxides approximate to nitrate > Fe oxyhydroxides > sulfate The aerobic oxidation of organic matter generates CO2 and inorganic nutrients, which are released to the interstitial waters of the sediments and are then subsequently available to participate in other geochemical processes The most important processes of anaerobic respiration include nitrate reduction (denitrification), and the reduction of sulfate, Fe, and Mn Nitrate reduction is considered to be a relatively minor process, but represents one of the most important sinks in the nitrogen cycle The abundances of Fe (primarily) and Mn (secondarily) in the terrestrial crust, as well as their capacity to change between different oxidation states, has made of these metals key electron acceptors in microbial respiration Sulfate reduction, which consists of the oxidation of organic matter at the expense of the reduction of dissolved sulfate to H2S, is the dominant process of organic matter remineralization in shallow, coastal sediments Deposition of detrital minerals in the sediments results in chemical reactions that may precipitate new minerals (authigenesis) or may dissolve the existing ones These processes are part of the reactions known as diagenesis and may occur under oxic, anoxic non-sulfidic, and anoxic sulfidic conditions, with each one of these sedimentary conditions producing different authigenic minerals The primary authigenic minerals of Fe are oxides (which include oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides of iron), a carbonate mineral (siderite), a phosphorus mineral (vivianite), and stable and metastable iron sulfides (amorphous FeS, mackinawite, greigite, and pyrite) Manganese also forms oxides (rhodochrosite) and, rarely, alabandite and reddingite Phosphorus can coprecipitate with Fe (vivianite) and, under anoxic or suboxic conditions, authigenic carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) may also be formed All these diagenetic processes form part of the greater global biogeochemical cycle, m which transferring reactions exhibit equal transfer of material through the different flow paths Knowledge of the interrelationships between the different biogeochemical cycles is crucial for our understanding of the Earth system

AB  - Despite the widespread use of carbon stable isotopes to distinguish among potential energy pathways in food webs, their usefulness is limited where potential basal carbon sources are numerous and diverse. We measured carbon isotope values of the major fisheries species, the mostly carnivorous Scylla serrata (giant mud crab), and potential basal, autotrophic sources supporting the food web. Conventional mixing modelling of autotroph and crab isotope data could not differentiate contributions from different sources. Pooling of modelled contributions from sources with similar isotope values indicated a role for organic matter from seagrass meadows or saltmarshes, but still did not define contributions well. Crab isotope data from a subsequent, spatially explicit survey of 14 sites, selected to represent different distances from key habitats, were analyzed using multiple regression. Crab isotope values showed a significant relationship with distance from seagrass (R-2 = 0.87), but not with distance from mangroves or saltmarsh grass. Alongside seagrass meadows, crabs had very enriched isotope values, demonstrating their reliance on sources with enriched isotope values (seagrass and algae epiphytic on seagrass, 65-90% of their energy intake). At the site furthest from seagrass (21 km), crabs assimilated carbon primarily from depleted sources such as mangroves and terrestrial organic matter from coastal catchments (70-85%). Explicit spatial analysis of isotope data following a comprehensive survey revealed energy pathways not evident in conventional analyses.

AB  - Estuaries represent highly important nursery habitats for a range of species, with refuge and nutrition being two key benefits derived from estuaries. Quantifying these benefits provides us with a means for enhancing fisheries productivity. Metapenaeus macleayi (School Prawn) and Penaeus plebejus (Eastern King Prawn) are two commercially and recreationally important species in New South Wales that utilise estuarine nurseries throughout their life history. In this study, stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were used to determine the proportional contribution of primary producers to prawn nutrition in Brisbane Water (NSW). Both the saltmarsh grass Sporobolus virginicus and seagrass Zostera muelleri were found to support a high trophic contribution to prawns (up to 53% and 40%, respectively). The contributions of other primary producers such as mangroves, fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) and C-3 saltmarsh plants were generally found to be much lower (0.7-15%). Such findings are generally consistent with patterns observed in other south-east Australian estuaries, however such a dominant role of saltmarsh in the presence of seagrass is a novel finding. These results highlight linkages between habitats of conservation concern and highly valuable fisheries species, and the benefit of using sulfur as an additional marker in Bayesian mixing models examining estuarine food webs.

AB  - We investigated the distribution of living (stained) benthic foraminifera across a tropical, intertidal shoreline adjacent to Cocoa Creek, Queensland, Australia for the purpose of better understanding the nature of test production and ultimately fossil assemblage development within such environments. Short cores (up to 1 m) were collected during the wet and dry season, along an elevational gradient comprising non-vegetated intertidal mudflat and higherintertidal mangrove forest environments. The distribution of stained specimens can be broadly delineated into assemblages characterising 'upper mangrove' (2.64-2.91 m above Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT)) and 'low mangrove-mudflat' (1.62-2.18 m above LAT) environments. Agglutinated species were generally limited to upper mangrove stations. Calcareous species occurred within all of the intertidal environments examined but differ in their composition between upper and lower intertidal settings. Upper mangrove faunas were characterised by the agglutinated species Arenoparrella mexicana, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Miliammina fusca, Miliammina obliqua and Trochammina inflata and the calcareous species Helenina anderseni. Live (stained) assemblages at lower intertidal elevations were dominated by the calcareous species Ammonia aoteana, as well as Rosalina spp., Elphidium oceanicum, Triloculina oblonga, Ammonia pustulosa and Shackoinella globosa.
   Absolute densities of stained specimens were lowest within the low mangrove sediments (6-8 specimens per cm(2)) but higher within the upper mangrove (25-249 specimens per cm(2)) and mudflat (8-77 specimens per cm(2)). Abundances within mudflat sediments varied seasonally (being significantly larger in the wet season) whereas those within mangrove zone sediments changed little through the year. Stained foraminifera were found to a maximum depth of 50 cm at Cocoa Creek, extending to the greatest depth at the upper mangrove stations, and were generally shallowest beneath the lower mangroves. All stations had over 50% of their foraminiferal standing crop below the upper I cm, although at most stations <10% of living specimens occurred within this layer.
   Comparison of this data with dead assemblages suggests that: (1) abundances of stained specimens, averaged over two sampling events, reasonably approximate aggregate in situ test production; and (2) a clear enrichment of infaunal species occurs within the mangrove. The latter effect was less conspicuous on the mudflat due to high rates of mixing and assemblage time-averaging, which obscure the signal of test production within the dead assemblages. In both cases, the validity and stratigraphic resolution of surface assemblages for sea-level and other palaeoenvironmental reconstructions is questionable. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB  - The reconstruction of former environments, and ultimately relative sea-level changes, in coastal and estuarine environments normally utilises a range of microfossil proxies, such as diatoms, foraminifera and pollen. As microfossils are sometimes poorly preserved, sparse or absent from coastal sediments, this study assesses the potential of using delta(13)C and C/N analysis of sedimentary organic matter as an alternative. Contemporary high inter-tidal and sub-tidal surface saltmarsh sediments of the Mersey Estuary, UK, reveal distinctly different delta(13)C and C/N values, reflecting the contrasting sources of organic matter in relation to ground elevation within the tidal frame. Despite decomposition effects, the relationship between ground elevation, delta(13)C and C/N, is preserved in the sediment record, with a gradual increase in delta(13)C and decrease in C/N from supra-tidal, through to inter-tidal and to sub-tidal environments. Holocene variations in delta(13)C and C/N are compared with stratigraphical palaeoenvironmental changes inferred from diatom and pollen evidence and show a good correspondence. Although delta(13)C and C/N are not as accurate as microfossil analysis in terms of coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, they may be applied successfully in the field of relative sea-level reconstruction by helping to verify sea-level index points when microfossils are absent.

AB  - The composition and abundance of the poorly known benthic macroinfauna associated with northern Brazilian saltmarshes, were described from eight sites (between 0 degrees 42'2.5 '' S, 47 degrees 52'44.1 '' W and 0 degrees 5 '' 17.3 '' S, 46 degrees 36'13.3 '' W) along the Para coast, Brazil. Sampling was carried out in November of 2007. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test for differences in sediment, vegetation and macroinfaunal variables among sites. No vertical zonation of the macroinfauna was detected. Macroinfaunal structure differed greatly among sites with different sediment and vegetation characteristics. Number of individuals and taxa were low in sites with sandy sediments and short, sparse vegetation and high in those with silty sediments with high organic matter and water contents, and tall, dense vegetation. Increasing number of individuals and taxa were associated with a geographical gradient in pore water salinity, which increases from west to east, coinciding with patterns of rainfall described for the Para coast.

AB  - Invasive plants acting as habitat modifiers in coastal wetlands can have extensive ecological impacts. Control of invasive plants often relies on herbicides, although little is known about subsequent environmental impacts. Studying effects of herbicides on non-target species and long-term cascading consequences may yield insights into the ecology of invasive species by revealing interactions with native species. We conducted a long-term field experiment measuring effects of treating the invasive saltmarsh grass, Spartina anglica, with the herbicide Fusilade Forte (R). No changes in sedimentary macrofaunal abundances or species richness, diversity, or assemblages were detected 1-2 months after spraying, despite known toxicity of Fusilade Forte to fauna. This lack of impact may have been due to low exposure, since the herbicide was taken up primarily by plant leaves, with the small amount that reached the sediment hydrolyzing rapidly. Six months after spraying, however, total macrofauna in treated plots was more than four times more abundant than in unsprayed control plots, due to a fifteen-fold increase in annelids. This population growth correlated with increased sedimentary organic matter in treated plots, likely due to decomposition of dead S. anglica leaves serving as food for annelids. After another year, no differences in macrofauna or organic matter remained between treatments. The indirect effect on annelid populations from herbicide treatment could benefit management efforts by providing greater food resources for wading birds, in addition to improving birds' access to sediments by reducing plant cover. This study shows that an invasive grass can have a significant impact on native fauna through food-web interactions, influenced by herbicide usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aims The inverse relationship between stomatal density (SD: number of stomata per mm(2) leaf area) and atmospheric concentration of CO, ([CO2]) permits the use of plants as proxies of palaeo-atmospheric CO,. Many stomata! reconstructions of palaeo-[CO2] are based upon multiple fossil species. However, it is unclear how plants respond to across genus, family or ecotype in terms of SD or stomatal index (SI: ratio of stomata to epidermal cells). This study analysed the stomatal numbers of conifers from the ancient family Cupressaceae, in order to examine the nature of the SI [CO2] relationship, and potential implications for stomatal reconstructions of pakteo-[CO2].
   Methods Stomatal frequency measurements were taken from historical herbarium specimens of Athrotaxis cupressoides,Tetraclinis articulata and four Callitris species, and live A. cupressoides grown under CO2-enrichment (370, 470, 570 and 670 p.p.m. CO2)
   Key Results T articulata, C. colummaris and C. rhomboidea displayed significant reductions in SI with rising [CO2]; by contrast. A. cupressoides, C. preissii and C. oblonga show no response in SI. However, A. cupressoides does reduce SI to increases in [Cad above current ambient (approx. 380 p.p.m. CO2). This dataset suggests that a shared consistent SI-[CO2] relationship is not apparent across the genus Callitris.
   Conclusions The present findings suggest that it is not possible to generalize how conifer species respond to fluctuations in [CO2] based upon taxonomic relatedness or habitat. This apparent lack of a consistent response, in conjunction with high variability in SI, indicates that reconstructions of absolute palaeo-[CO2] based it the genus level, or upon multiple species for discrete intervals of time are not as reliable as those based on a single or multiple temporally overlapping species.

AB  - Restoration is an increasingly employed method for rehabilitating and enhancing the ecosystem services of lost or degraded coastal habitats, such as supporting high faunal densities and biomass. In certain ecosystems, faunal densities along habitat ecotones are greater than the densities observed in either adjoining habitat, potentially due to the provision of spatial subsidies (e.g., increased food availability). We tested the hypothesis that seagrass-associated consumers immediately adjacent to a saltmarsh are the recipients of food subsidies sourced from saltmarsh primary production. The food web biomarkers we used to evaluate spatial flows of energy across estuarine habitat boundaries included the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13), nitrogen (delta N-15), and sulfur (delta S-34). We collected primary producers (N = 102) including macrophytic vegetation, benthic microalgae, and epiphytes, as well as 11 key consumers (N = 190) across seagrass meadows either immediately adjacent to (N = 8) or isolated from (N = 8) saltmarsh. We also estimated particulate organic matter (POM) from filter-feeding bivalves and used literature values as proxies for detritus. These food-web biomarkers reveal that seagrass-associated consumers derived 20-23% of basal primary production from the saltmarsh, regardless of saltmarsh proximity. Seagrass sources (epiphytes and vegetation) as well as POM, likely were the dominant contributors for these consumers. This finding indicates that other mechanisms (i.e., refuge provision) might be the primary driver resulting in increased nekton density within seagrass along seagrass-saltmarsh ecotones. While a synergistic restoration of saltmarsh and seagrass habitat may have a positive effect on faunal biomass, it appears there may not be a primary food subsidy benefit to seagrass-associated consumers.

AB  - Wetlands are vulnerable ecosystems to climate change for they would normally adapt slowly to keep pace with changing environmental conditions especially wetlands located at high altitudes which are under threat of severe warming. In this paper, we used distribution data of four types of wetlands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and ensemble habitat distribution models (HDMs) to assess the potential impacts of climate change under three IPCC scenarios. The baseline year was 2000s and the scenarios were used for 3 periods (2020s, 2050s and 2080s) at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km. The simulation results show that severe warming will happen in mid-21st century and annual average temperature will be above 0 degrees C. Areas climatically suitable for alpine wetlands tend to shift and shrink generally in the QTP in the future. Even under the optimistic scenario, the total area of wetland is predicted to decline by 35.7%. Nearly all wet meadow and saltmarsh will disappear under all scenarios in the Qiangtang basin. Vital functions of alpine wetlands such as carbon sequestration, water maintain, and habitats provide will be at severe risk. This research provides valuable information for the future conservation of the alpine wetlands within the QTP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Centuries of coastal development has led to the loss of saltmarsh extent worldwide. As marshes are shrinking, scientific understanding of marsh expansion and erosion processes is growing. Coastal managers are also recognising the importance of marshes for flood protection, carbon sequestration, and pollutant filtering. Considerable effort is now being made to conserve saltmarshes. However, the rapid integration of science in policy remains an obstacle for ensuring successful conservation outcomes. This review explores how advances in the understanding of coastal dynamics, and the evolution of coastal management thinking, are shaping saltmarsh conservation policy in Great Britain. Saltmarsh management has shifted from reclamation, to protection, to restoration throughout the 20th and 21st centuries as calls for nature conservation grew and the importance of ecosystems in coastal erosion riskmanagement becameapparent. Studies have revealed that marshes cycle between expansion and erosion phases as part of their natural evolution, governed by processes acting across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Understandingwhich processes drive long-termmarsh change provides an opportunity for coastal managers to undertake targeted intervention for positive conservation outcomes. The inherently dynamic nature of marshes also raises significant challenges in forecasting the long-term value provided by a given marsh. Challenges remain in the monitoring and management of sediment supply and transport, and the effective engagement with stakeholders during habitat protection and creation schemes, which are key to achieving marsh conservation goals.

AB  - Sequential sediment extractions are used to assess the partitioning of Fe, Mn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb, as a function of depth, in the sediments of two pairs of saltmarsh sites, chosen to represent a gradient of macrophyte and macrofaunal density. One pair is located adjacent to a large tidal creek, and includes a nearly unvegetated site and a site densely vegetated by tall-form Spartina alterniflora. The other two sites, located higher in the marsh, are densely vegetated by Juncus roemarianus and sparsely vegetated by short-form S. alternifora. At each site, trace element distributions among four operationally-defined solid fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, reducible and oxidizable) were measured at 4-5 cm intervals from the sediment water interface to a depth of up to 50 cm. The operationally-defined extractions suggest that in suboxic sediments, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co and Zn occur in association with Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides. In sulfidic sediments, Fe, Co and Ni probably occur mostly in pyrite. Mn is likely pyritized and may also form rhodochrosite at two of the sites, Cr is likely bound mostly to organic matter, and Zn, Cu and Pb are inferred to occur in association with both sulfides and organic matter. The depth- and site-dependent trace element distributions are in surprisingly good agreement with variations in redox geochemistry inferred from pore water data in a companion study [Koretsky, C.M., Haveman, M., Cuellar, A., Beuving, L., Shattuck, T., Wagner, M., 2008. Influence of Spartina and Juncus on saltmarsh sediments. I. Pore water geochemistry. Chemical Geology]. This demonstrates that, in spite of their inherently operational nature, sequential sediment extractions can yield useful insights into metal speciation, especially when measured in conjunction with pore water geochemistry. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that lateral and vertical variations in saltmarsh pore water chemistry lead to distinct variability in solid phase trace metal distributions.

AB  - The membrane-less and biocathode-containing microbial fuel cells (MLBC-MFCs) were used for the electrical energy production from different wetlands, and the corresponding mechanisms were explored based on the characteristics of dissolved organic matters (DOM) in this study. The average voltage output on indoor MLBC-MFCs was 60 mV for the saltmarsh wetland water (SWW), 48 mV for the forest wetland water (FWW) and 71 mV for the FWW supplemented with sodium chloride (FWWS). For the field experiments, as high as 800 mV was obtained from the MLBC-MFCs installed in the forest wetland and the voltage output varying between 200 mV and 800 mV maintained approximately for half a year except for a few days with an extremely low temperature, while the voltage output from the MLBC-MFCs installed in the saltmarsh wetland went down to below 10 mV within 37 days likely due to the fide. The DOM before and after MFCs treatment was analyzed using the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). Results showed that both carbon sources and anaerobic microorganisms included in subaqueous wetland sediments (SWSs) were vital for the electricity generation, and the food used to produce electrical energy mainly came from SWSs instead of wetlands water.

AB  - The influence of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemarianus on saltmarsh sediment pore water geochemistry was investigated during summer at four sites in a saltmarsh on Sapelo Island, GA, USA. Pore waters were collected from each site at 1-2 cm intervals, to a depth of 50 cm, and analyzed for pH, alkalinity, dissolved manganese, ferric iron, ferrous iron, total sulfide, sulfate, phosphate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium and potassium. The most compressed vertical redox stratification occurs at a short Spartina site, followed closely by an adjacent Juncus site. Both sites have shallow oxic and suboxic zones, with sulfidic conditions only a few centimeters or less from the sediment water interface. The densely vegetated Juncus site is inferred to have greater primary productivity and organic matter turnover compared to the short Spartina site. More radial oxygen loss is postulated to occur in the subsurface of the Juncus site, leading to reoxidation of reduced species, more acidic conditions and less accumulation of dissolved sulfide, ammonium and oxidizable-Fe in the solid phase compared to the adjacent short Spartina site. A creekside site vegetated by tall Spartina has the most oxidized sediments, followed by an adjacent unvegetated site. Both of these sites are dominated by suboxic pore waters in most of the upper 50 cm. Subsurface injection of oxygen via roots at the densely vegetated tall Spartina site is inferred to create more acidic pore waters with significantly less accumulation of reduced solutes, including ammonium and alkalinity, compared to the adjacent unvegetated creekside site. Fe and Mn reduction are expected to be significant processes in the bulk near-surface sediments of the tall Spartina and unvegetated sites and within rhizosphere sediments at the tall Spartina and Juncus sites. This study demonstrates the significant influence of Juncus roemarianus and Spartina alterniflora on saltmarsh sediment pore water geochemistry, with important implications for nutrient and trace metal mobility and bioavailability. Future work is needed to explore differences in organic matter concentration and especially ability in the subsurface of saltmarsh sites with varying types and densities of vegetation.

AB  - 1. Biogeochemical tracers such as stable isotopes are often used to determine sources and pathways of organic matter through food webs, which may provide powerful indicators of environmental stress or insight into resource management issues. However, mixing models using such tracers are algebraically constrained and rarely attempted for more than two sources. This makes them of limited value for ecosystems that have numerous contributing sources.
   2. We developed two complementary mixing models, SOURCE and STEP, which use linear programming techniques with multiple tracers, to estimate the dominant primary producer sources of consumers, and their diets and trophic levels, regardless of the number of sources and trophic steps.
   3. SOURCE is used to estimate consumers' direct and indirect uptake of autotrophic sources and their trophic levels. STEP calculates an estimate of a consumer's diet, which may include autotrophs and/or heterotrophs.
   4. The two models were tested using simulated data sets of producer and consumer tracer values and then used with published delta(13)C, delta(15)N and delta(34)S data from a study tracing organic matter flows in a saltmarsh estuary.
   5. SOURCE and STEP accurately estimated flows and trophic structures in the simulations, with average errors of 0.07-0.09 for SOURCE and 0.03-0.05 for STEP, depending on the number of tracers used.
   6. We illustrate two resultant food webs for the saltmarsh estuary showing possible interpretations of the SOURCE and STEP estimates.
   7. Synthesis and applications. SOURCE and STEP can be used with stable isotope data to estimate accurately consumers' trophic levels, primary producer dependence and diets, even when the number of potential autotrophic sources or foods is larger than the number of tracers. SOURCE and STEP could be used to assess the roles played by individual species within food webs, to compare food webs across locations or over time, and to examine potential pollutant bioaccumulation in higher order consumers, among other potential applications. The S-PLUS code for both models is available at http://staff.washington.edu/lubetkin.

AB  - Stable isotope analyses of the abundant infaunal polychaete Hediste diversicolor, recognised as an indicator of sewage pollution, support the hypothesis that nutrient enrichment promotes surface deposit feeding, over suspension feeding and predation. At sewage-polluted sites in three estuaries in SE England Hediste mainly consumed microphytobenthos, sediment organic matter and filamentous macroalgae Ulva spp. At cleaner sites Hediste relied more on suspension feeding and consumption of Spartina anglica. There were no consistent differences in Hediste densities between the polluted and cleaner sites, probably because of increased densities at the cleaner sites too, facilitated by the planting of Spartina and nitrogen enrichment there too, including from agricultural run-off. Increased nutrient enrichment and the artificial availability-of Spartina have probably increased densities of, and deposit-feeding by, Hediste in the past half-century and contributed indirectly to saltmarsh losses, since deposit-feeding by Hediste has been implicated in recent saltmarsh erosion in SE England.

AB  - Despite the acknowledged environmental, economic and social importance of mangroves, one important question remains should mangrove substrate be considered soil or sediment? This chapter presents results obtained from several studies performed with mangrove soils from the State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) and based on the four soil forming processes additions, losses, transformations and translocations These results provide evidence for the occurrence of soil processes that lead to the transformation of deposited sediments into soil Such changes are induced by the transformation of organic matter in anoxic and suboxic environments, combined with the action of vegetation and bioturbation by macrofauna After a brief discussion of sedimentological and mineralogical aspects associated with the formation of these environments during the Late Quaternary, some physicochemical data are presented The results show a greater degree of variability in physicochemical parameters in soils (vegetated substrates) than in non-vegetated substrates Inputs of organic matter are tend to be higher in vegetated substrates, primarily due to the root biomass, which leads to an oxidizing environment and to higher concentrations of reactive forms of Fe (Fe oxides and poorly-crystalline compounds), especially in surface layers This process is related to oxidization of iron sulfides and to a decrease in pyrite-Fe The results also indicate a gradual increase in the sulfidization processes with depth, due to decreases in the amount of roots and bioturbation by macrofauna The importance of biotic factors in controlling the four pedogenic processes on mangrove substrates is therefore confirmed Further evidence of pedogenesis is also provided by the increasing degree of crystallinity of the clay minerals (mainly smectites) with depth, indicating a gradual dominance of diagenesis over pedogenesis in deeper layers Finally, aspects of soil classification are discussed and related to the physicochemical processes observed in mangrove soils

AB  - Coastal saltmarshes are key ecosystems with important ecological functions. Yet, they have experienced a widespread decline. Due to their importance, the conservation and restoration of saltmarshes are globally shared objectives, including China. Despite multiple local studies, nationwide information about saltmarshes in China is scarce. Thus, we used remote sensing to delineate the spatial distribution and areal extent of saltmarshes along coastal China and resolve their species composition. By interpreting 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images on Google Earth Engine, assisted with field survey and literature search, a total of 118 010 ha of saltmarshes were delineated in coastal China in 2019. Seven typical saltmarsh species were identified, with Phragmites australis, Spartina alterniflora, and Scirpus mariquater as dominant species, accounting for 95.5% of total saltmarsh extent, while Suaeda salsa, Tamarix chinensis, Cyperus malaccensis, and Sesuvium portulacastrum were present in limited abundance. The P. australis and exotic species S. alterniflora grow along almost all coastal provinces, but P. australis dominates in the north while S. alterniflora dominates in the middle part of coastal China. Suaeda salsa occurs mainly in the north and has suffered large losses. Tamarix chinensis is abundant in Shandong province, S. mariquater in the Yangtze River delta, C. malaccensis in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and S. portulacastrum in Taiwan. The exotic species S. alterniflora expanded extensively along the coast and its expansion rate continues to increase. The results provided conform a much-needed baseline for future monitoring efforts and the assessment of progress in the conservation and restoration projects toward recovering saltmarshes in China.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems, such as saltmarsh, produce a range of ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. In the UK, and globally, saltmarsh extent and quality is declining due to coastal squeeze, deteriorating water quality, and agricultural activities. Here, we develop a general framework to evaluate changes in coastal defence. Using this framework, we identify priority areas for saltmarsh re-alignment: re-creation of saltmarsh in areas that have been saltmarsh in the past - but that have been claimed for a variety of land uses, particularly agriculture. We base our re-alignment prioritisation on the ecosystem services provided by saltmarsh in the North Devon Biosphere Reserve: specifically carbon sequestration and recreational benefits, and the economic values of those services. We compare potential economic benefits with the economic costs of creating new saltmarsh areas - specifically lost agricultural output, property damages and direct re-alignment costs. We identify a number of priority areas for managed re-alignment that generate high recreational values in areas where properties would not be damaged. These findings provide a necessary and timely analysis for the managers of the North Devon Biosphere Reserve. Furthermore, we outline a comprehensive methodology to plan future management of coastal zones.

AB  - This work studied the spatial and seasonal variations of the macrobenthic community structure of the Minho estuary saltmarsh, which involved examining the relationships between the macrobenthic community and the abiotic characteristics of the surrounding sediments: texture, organic matter content and metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn) concentrations. These abiotic characteristics showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial and seasonal variations that demonstrated the complex sedimentary dynamics of this saltmarsh. The macrobenthic community structure consisted of 37 taxa belonging to 5 phyla: Annelida (10 taxa), Mollusca (4 taxa), Arthropoda (21 taxa), Chordata (1 taxon) and Sipuncula (1 taxon). The mean annual abundance was 1530 ind/m(2), and the most abundant species were Cyathura carinata, Scolelepis squamata and Hediste diversicolor. The macrobenthic community showed no standard spatial distribution throughout the saltmarsh, and species abundances showed high seasonal variations that were directly dependent on the natural environmental conditions of each season. Although the Minho estuary saltmarsh showed evidence of anthropogenic contamination by metals, the macrobenthic community was not significantly influenced by their presence, and the main structuring factor was the texture of the sediments.

AB  - Coastal habitats worldwide face various threats, including sea level rise and land conversion. Coastal habitat loss has important economic consequences, as many of these habitats provide valuable ecosystem services including flood protection, carbon sequestration, and nursery areas for commercially fished species. Quantifying the economic value of these ecosystem services helps target policies for coastal habitat restoration. Here, we demonstrate how to quantify the contribution made by coastal habitats to the revenue (e.g., ex-vessel values) of commercially fished species by estimating a residency index. This residency index weights the relative importance of a habitat along a species' lifecycle by explicitly incorporating the target species' life histories and the estimated proportion of time the species spends in that habitat at different life stages. We demonstrate how this method can be used to estimate the value of saltmarsh to UK commercial fisheries landings. This analysis suggests that UK saltmarsh contributes annually between 15% and 17.5% of total UK commercial landings for European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), and Common sole (Solea solea). Our findings support an economic argument for saltmarsh protection and restoration. Furthermore, our approach provides a general framework that integrates demographic methods and economic analyses to assess the value of saltmarsh and other coastal habitats for fisheries worldwide.

AB  - A global trend of woody plant encroachment of terrestrial grasslands is co-incident with woody plant encroachment of wetland in freshwater and saline intertidal settings. There are several arguments for considering tree encroachment of wetlands in the context of woody shrub encroachment of grassland biomes. In both cases, delimitation of woody shrubs at regional scales is set by temperature thresholds for poleward extent, and by aridity within temperature limits. Latitudinal expansion has been observed for terrestrial woody shrubs and mangroves, following recent warming, but most expansion and thickening has been due to the occupation of previously water-limited grassland/saltmarsh environments. Increases in atmospheric CO2, may facilitate the recruitment of trees in terrestrial and wetland settings. Improved water relations, a mechanism that would predict higher soil moisture in grasslands and saltmarshes, and also an enhanced capacity to survive arid conditions, reinforces local mechanisms of change. The expansion of woody shrubs and mangroves provides a negative feedback on elevated atmospheric CO2 by increasing carbon sequestration in grassland and saltmarsh, and is a significant carbon sink globally. These broad-scale vegetation shifts may represent a new stable state, reinforced by positive feedbacks between global change drivers and endogenic mechanisms of persistence in the landscape.

AB  - We surveyed Spartina saltmarsh sediment rhizosphere fungal communities at three saltmarshes and two timepoints in coastal Nova Scotia. Based on ITS2 Illumina miSeq rDNA data and multivariate analysis, neither sediment zone nor collection period correlated with fungal ASV richness, but collection site did. However, Shannon diversity indicated that sediment zone played a significant role in fungal diversity. For unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance, site was the major factor driving beta-diversity, with sediment zone and collection period having smaller roles. Sediment type and saltmarsh plant species may play important roles in structuring rhizosphere fungal assemblages, here dominated by ascomycetes. To our knowledge, our study is the first to assess fungal sediment communities in saltmarshes in Atlantic Canada using metabarcoding. It provides a biodiversity analysis of sediment fungi in a poorly studied but highly important ecosystem and points to their roles in nutrient cycling, blue carbon, coastal stability and coastal restoration. Our work will inform ongoing saltmarsh restoration in Atlantic Canada.

AB  - Intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh, and tidal flats face multiple stresses along the burgeoning East Asia coastline. In addition to direct habitat loss, ecosystem structure, function, and capacity for ecosystem services of these habitats are significantly affected by anthropogenic loss of hydrologic connectivity, introduction of invasive exotic species, and chemical pollution. These dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function are illustrated by four case studies along the East Asian coast: the Mai Po Marshes in Hong Kong, the Yunxiao wetlands in Fujian, China, and the Lake Sihwa and Saemangeum tidal flats in Korea. While investment in restoration is increasing significantly in the region, the lack of key basic knowledge on aspects of the behaviour of intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems, particularly those in Asia, impairs the effectiveness of these efforts. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function for relatively species-poor mangrove, seagrass, and saltmarsh systems has implications for restoration targeting monospecific plantations. The trajectory of recovery and return of ecosystem function and services is also poorly known, and may deviate from simple expectations. As many introduced species have become established along the East Asian coast, their long-term impact on ecosystem function as well as the socio-economics of coastal communities demand a multidisciplinary approach to assessing options for restoration and management. These knowledge gaps require urgent attention in order to inform future restoration and management of intertidal soft-sediment ecosystems in fast-developing East Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research is concerned with the following environmental research questions: socio-ecological system complexity, especially when valuing ecosystem services; ecosystems stock and services flow sustainability and valuation; the incorporation of scale issues when valuing ecosystem services; and the integration of knowledge from diverse disciplines for governance and decision making. In this case study, we focused on ecosystem services that can be jointly supplied but independently valued in economic terms: healthy climate (via carbon sequestration and storage), food (via fisheries production in nursery grounds), and nature recreation (nature watching and enjoyment). We also explored the issue of ecosystem stock and services flow, and we provide recommendations on how to value stock and flows of ecosystem services via accounting and economic values respectively. We considered broadly comparable estuarine systems located on the English North Sea coast: the Blackwater estuary and the Humber estuary. In the past, these two estuaries have undergone major land-claim. Managed realignment is a policy through which previously claimed intertidal habitats are recreated allowing the enhancement of the ecosystem services provided by saltmarshes. In this context, we investigated ecosystem service values, through biophysical estimates and welfare value estimates. Using an optimistic (extended conservation of coastal ecosystems) and a pessimistic (loss of coastal ecosystems because of, for example, European policy reversal) scenario, we find that context dependency, and hence value transfer possibilities, vary among ecosystem services and benefits. As a result, careful consideration in the use and application of value transfer, both in biophysical estimates and welfare value estimates, is advocated to supply reliable information for policy making.

AB  - The aim of this work was to characterize the macrobenthic community of intertidal flats in southern Patagonia, by identifying the faunal assemblages and analyzing their relationship with the main environmental factors. The study was conducted in four localities of southern Santa Cruz (Argentina): Bahia San Julian (49 degrees 18'S, 67 degrees 41'W) and the lower reaches of the estuaries of Rio Santa Cruz (50 degrees 05'S, 68 degrees 29'W), Rio Coyle (50 degrees 58'S, 69 degrees 16'W) and Rio Gallegos (51 degrees 37'S, 69 degrees 02'W). Surveys were performed in spring 2015 and summer 2016 at the upper, middle and lower intertidal levels. Four sediment samples were collected per intertidal level at each locality in each sampling period with a corer (0.00785 m(2)) up to 20 cm in depth. The organisms were separated using a 0.5 mm mesh sieve for subsequent identification and quantification. To explore possible spatial variations in the community, environmental and abundance data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Intertidal level, substrate grain size and organic matter content were determinant factors of distribution of benthic assemblages. The Darina solenoides-Scolecolepides uncinatus-Eteone sculpta assemblage was characteristic of sand-mud substrates with dominance of silt-clay and greatest organic matter content of upper and middle intertidal. The D. solenoides-Ampelisca sp. assemblage was characteristic of the lower intertidal, with dominance of fine sand. The presence of saltmarshes was also a factor determining benthic assemblages at the upper intertidal of the estuarine localities. This work provides useful information to implement adequate management actions to protect the lower reaches of the Rio Santa Cruz estuary.

AB  - Estuarine wetlands are an extremely valuable resource in terms of biotic diversity, flood attenuation, storm surge protection, groundwater recharge, filtering of surface flows and carbon sequestration. The survival of these systems depends on a balance between the slope of the land, and the rates of accretion and sea-level rise. Climate change predictions for most of Australia include both an accelerated sea-level rise and an increase on the frequency of extraordinary river floods, which will endanger estuarine wetlands. Furthermore, coastal infrastructure poses an additional constraint on the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems. In recent years a number of numerical models have been developed in order to assess wetland dynamics and to help manage some of these situations.
   In this paper we present a wetland evolution model that is based on computed values of hydroperiod and tidal range that drive vegetation preference. Results from a 2D spatially distributed model of wetland dynamics in area E of Kooragang Island (Hunter estuary, NSW) are presented as an example of a system heavily constricted by infrastructure undergoing the effects of sea level rise. Area E presents a vegetation zonation sequence mudflats - mangrove - saltmarsh from the seaward margin and up to the topographic gradient and is compartmentalized by the presence of internal culverts. The model includes a detailed hydrodynamic module (CTSS8), which is able to handle man-made flow controls and spatially varying roughness. The model continually simulates tidal inputs into the wetland and computes annual values of hydroperiod and tidal range to update vegetation distribution based on preference to hydrodynamic conditions of the different vegetation types. It also computes soil accretion and carbon sequestration rates and updates roughness coefficient values according to evolving vegetation types.
   In order to further explore the magnitude of flow attenuation due to roughness and its effects on the computation of tidal range and hydroperiod, numerical experiments were carried out simulating floodplain flow on the side of a tidal creek using different roughness values. Even though the values of roughness that produce appreciable changes in hydroperiod and tidal range are relatively high, they are within the range expected for some of the wetland vegetation.
   Both applications of the model show that flow attenuation plays a major role in wetland hydrodynamics and that its effects must be considered when predicting wetland evolution under climate change scenarios, particularly in situations where existing infrastructure affects the flow.

AB  - The role of birds in intertidal food webs is mediated by effects of tides on the habitat, distribution, and accessibility of food organisms. We studied effects of elevation, sediment characteristics, vegetation, and tidal cycles on waterfowl feeding and food organisms in Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada from September to March 1990-1992. Percent dry mass of esophageal contents was mainly Zostera japonica leaves (84%) for American wigeon (Anas americana Gmelin), and leaves of Z. japonica (57%) and Z. marina (41%) for brant (Branta bernicla L.). Northern pintails (A. acuta L.) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos L.) ate mostly the leaves, seeds, and rhizomes of Z. japonica (48 and 72%, respectively) and gastropods (12 and 28%). Green-winged teal (A. crecca L.) ate mainly amphipods (68%) and saltmarsh seeds (19%). The well-sorted fine sand (median 0.125 mm) to medium sand (0.25 mm), and the low organic carbon content (1.31 +/-0.12% dry mass), did not appear to vary sufficiently along 2.1- and 2.6-km transects to affect macroinvertebrate distributions. Three habitat zones were recognized: (1) upper intertidal (sandflats); (2) mid-intertidal (largely monotypic Z. japonica); and (3) lower intertidal (mixed Z. japonica and Z. marina). These zones, although related to elevation, had greater influence on amphipod distributions than did elevation alone or detrital biomass. Biomass and numbers of most invertebrate foods of waterfowl were greatest in the eelgrass zones, with the upper elevational limit of Z. japonicn occurring at about Mean Water Level (MWL). Accordingly, wigeon, pintails, and mallards fed mostly below MWL. Because of seasonal tidal cycles, daily accessibility of areas below MWL but within reach of surface-feeding waterfowl decreased from a mean of 10.8 h in October to 9.6 h in December. In October only 10 d had <12 h available feeding time, whereas in December and January every day had <12 h available feeding time. Seasonal effects of tides on accessibility might limit sufficient feeding by some waterfowl species in intertidal areas, increasing their reliance on alternative feeding sites.

AB  - Adult mosquito traps are commonly used in biosecurity surveillance for the detection of exotic mosquito incursions or for the demonstration of elimination. However, traps are typically deployed without knowledge of how many are required for detecting differing numbers of the target species. The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity (i.e., detection probability) provided by carbon dioxide-baited EVS traps for adult female Australian southern saltmarsh mosquitoes, Aedes camptorhynchus, a recent biosecurity problem for New Zealand. A mark-release-recapture study of three concurrently released cohorts (sized 56, 296, and 960), recaptured over four days with a matrix of 20 traps, was conducted in Australia. The detection probability for different numbers of traps and cohorts of different sizes was determined by random sampling of recapture data. Detection probability ranged from approximately 0.3 for a single trap detecting a cohort of 56 mosquitoes to 1.0 (certainty of detection) when seven or more traps were used. For detection of adult Ae. camptorhynchus around a known source, a matrix of traps provides a strong probability of detection. Conversely, the use of single traps deployed over very large areas to detect mosquitoes of unknown entry pathway is unlikely to be successful. These findings have implications for the design of mosquito surveillance for biosecurity.

AB  - Meiofaunal assemblages are often overlooked, yet they are important ecological components of estuarine ecosystems. To evaluate variations in meiofaunal communities in estuarine habitats, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of meiofaunal density, distribution and relationships with environmental parameters in a mangrove-dominated ecosystem at Mangawhai, Northern New Zealand, in summer (March) and winter (October), 2013. Five habitat types were studied including mangrove stands, pneumatophore zones, sandflats, mudflats and saltmarshes. In addition, data were recorded for sediment grain size, organic content, and primary benthic productivity (chlorophyll a). Twelve major taxa were identified, with meiofaunal densities ranging between 269 and 8090 ind. 10 cm(-2). Highest abundances were found in fine-grained organic-rich sediments compared to coarse-grained organically poor sediments; the former were generally associated with mangroves stands and pneumatophore zones. Nematodes dominated all observed habitats. Foraminifera ranked second in fine-grained organically rich sediments, whereas copepods ranked second in coarser-grained sediments. Results suggest that meiofaunal taxonomic abundance and distribution are highly sensitive to local physical and biological parameters (e.g. sediment grain size, organic content, benthic primary productivity). The findings revealed that environmental characteristics have an important influence within this temperate estuary.

AB  - Fish habitat use is affected by biotic and environmental factors. These factors do not act in isolation; they commonly operate together, and can be modified by the presence of habitat structure, like vegetation. We studied at the Bahia Blanca estuary (38 degrees 52' S, 62 0 degrees 6' W), the seasonal patterns of fish habitat use in a Spartina alterniflora saltmarsh and a contiguous tidal fiat, and related them with biotic and environmental factors. The results showed that all fish species contributed to differences in the structure of fish assemblages between areas. The silverside Odontesthes argentinensis and the menhaden Brevoortia aurea were more abundant and smaller in size in the saltmarsh. In this area, the structure of fish assemblage was positively correlated with the structure of benthic community. The latter, was probably related to the high abundance of the polychaete Laeonereis acuta, the main benthic prey for fishes. Environmental factors that correlated with the structure of fish assemblages were particulate organic matter and sediment penetrability, both in the saltmarsh and in the tidal flat. This evidenced that in terms of physical and chemical factors studied, both areas present similar characteristics for fishes. This work highlights that saltmarshes in southern hemisphere provide both protection and food resources for fishes, and give support to the notion of saltmarshes as important fish habitat worldwide.

AB  - The vegetation-environment relationships in the inland saltmarshes of two geographically distant eases of the Western Desert of Egypt, Siwa, and Dakhla Gases, are described. Two data sets (25 species x 68 stands for Siwa Oasis and 29 species x 89 stands for Dakhla Oasis) were analysed, using multivariate procedures, i.e., two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA), to produce a classification of plant communities in the studied areas, and to examine the relationships of these plant communities to certain edaphic factors, namely soil reaction, total soluble salts, calcium carbonate, organic matter, moisture content, and fine fractions. Twelve halophytic plant communities linked to two main habitats (wet-moist and dry-mesic) were identified. Alhagi graecorum, Tamarix nilotica, Cressa cretica, Juncus rigidus and Phragmites australis were the most common in the two eases. Whereas communities of Cyperus laevigatus, Suaeda aegyptiaca, Suaeda vermiculata, Typha domingensis, and Aeluropus lagopoides are recorded from the Dakhla Oasis, Cladium mariscus and Arthrocnemum macrostachyum communities are recorded from the Siwa Oasis. The most important edaphic variables affecting the distribution and structure of the plant communities are salinity, moisture content and fine fractions, nevertheless CaCO3 content seems to be more effective in the Dakhla Oasis. A new agricultural strategy that minimizes the increase of salinized lands is called for.

AB  - The importance of organic matter produced in seagrass meadows (seagrass and epiphytic algae) to the nutrition of a valuable fisheries species (yellowfin whiting Sillago schomburgkii Peters) occurring over unvegetated mudflats was measured using the isotopic composition (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) of fish, their polychaete prey, and available autotrophic sources at several locations in southern Australia during 2 periods (summer, winter). Values for delta(13)C and delta(15)N for autotrophs and fishes varied little between seasons. Sources could be separated into 3 groups based on delta(13)C: seagrass and epiphytes (mean delta(13)C = -10.5parts per thousand), benthic microalgae and macroalgae (-19.5parts per thousand), and saltmarsh and mangroves (-26.5parts per thousand). Values of delta(15)N or the sources were 2 to 5parts per thousand. Values of delta(13)C for fish (-13.3parts per thousand) corresponded with those of their polychaete prey (-12.5parts per thousand) and ultimately with those of seagrass and epiphytes. Values of delta(15)N were 5 to 6parts per thousand. more enriched than sources. Modelling of feasible source mixtures showed that seagrass and epiphytes were the most important contributors to the nutrition of fish, but their relative importance varied between seasons. The median contribution by other sources was <10%. Spatial analyses showed that saltmarsh plants contributed significantly to the variability in S. schomburgkii nutrition among locations, while macroalgae contributed in summer. The similarity in delta(13)C values of polychaetes and S. schomburgkii is consistent with source material from a subtidal habitat being incorporated into food webs supporting a fisheries species in adjacent intertidal habitats via a largely sedentary intermediary.

AB  - Testate amoebae are one of a few moisture-sensitive proxies available to study Holocene palaeohydrology. Although the majority of research has been conducted on ombrotrophic peatlands in the Northern Hemisphere, the application of testate amoebae in minerogenic sediments, such as minerotrophic peatlands and saltmarshes, holds considerable promise but is often impeded by the low concentration of testate amoebae and by time-consuming counting. Here a new preparation protocol to concentrate testate amoebae is proposed; it removes more minerogenic particles and organic matter, but results in negligible damage to testate amoebae. Sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7) is introduced to remove fine particles through deflocculation that, in contrast to the commonly used chemical digestion/deprotonation via an alkaline treatment, is more physically benign to testate amoebae. Furthermore, acetone is introduced as an organic co-solvent to increase the solubility of organic matter in the alkaline treatment. We test the new protocol against standard, water-based methods and find that the addition of sodium pyrophosphate yields the highest concentration and increases the total number of testate amoebae recovered. Statistical analyses (multivariate ANOVA and ordination) suggest that the new method retains the assemblage integrity. We conclude by recommending a protocol combining sodium pyrophosphate, acetone and a mild alkaline treatment, as this combination yields the best slide clarity, reduced counting time and results in negligible damage to testate amoebae.

AB  - We review the distribution, status and ecology of Australian saltmarshes and the mechanisms whereby enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide and associated climate change have influenced and will influence the provision of ecosystem goods and services. Research in temperate and subtropical saltmarsh has demonstrated important trophic contributions to estuarine fisheries, mediated by the synchronised mass-spawning of crabs, which feed predominantly on the C-4 saltmarsh grass Sporobolus virginicus and microphytobenthos. Saltmarshes also provide unique feeding and habitat opportunities for several species of threatened microbats and birds, including migratory shorebirds. Saltmarshes increased in extent relative to mangrove in Australia in both tide- and wave-dominated geomorphic settings through the latter Holocene, although historic trends have seen a reversal of this trend. Australian saltmarshes have some capacity to maintain elevation with respect to rising sea level, although in south-eastern Australia, the encroachment of mangrove and, in Tasmania, conversion of shrubland to herbfield in the past half-century are consistent with changes in relative sea level. Modelling of the impacts of projected sea-level rise, incorporating sedimentation and other surface-elevation drivers, suggests that the survival of saltmarsh in developed estuaries will depend on the flexible management of hard structures and other impediments to wetland retreat.

AB  - Vegetation pattern, soil attributes, and salinity regimes along with several other environmental factors were studied in a small (11 ha) but unmodified estuary in south Westland, New Zealand. Part of an unmodified 40 km(2) catchment within the South-west New Zealand World Heritage Area, the Hapuka Estuary, formed behind a 5-km long barrier beach, provides considerable ecological value as well as baseline, conservation advocacy and educative potentials both in a national and international context. Seventy-four quadrats were sampled randomly along five transects at right angles to the main Hapuka River. Eight plant communities comprising 141 native and thirteen exotic vascular species, were differentiated using multivariate analyses, from bare mud (mean elevation 1.23 +/- 0.24 m above Mean Low Water Spring (MLWS)), saltmarsh and shrubland associations through to the adjacent podocarp-broadleaved rain forest (4.53 +/- 0.74 m above MLWS). Bulk density of the upper 10 cm of substrate varied from a maximum of 1.15 g cm(-3) in the lowest elevation association to a minimum of 0.15 g cm(-3) in the rain forest. pH showed a similar trend with values of 6.97 and 4.31, respectively. The reverse pattern was evident with organic matter, with the highest content (53% ODWt) in the rain forest substrate. The water which irrigates the saltmarsh at high tide reaches 15-19 parts per thousand salinity on calm days but may be much less saline when moderate to strong southerly winds counter the tidal influence. Northerly winds, or a southern outlet through the barrier beach, intermittently evident in the past, are likely to enhance salinity of the tidal waters across the saltmarsh.
   Ordination of the vegetation samples indicated a very strong gradient associated with Axis 1 (eigenvalue=0.872) and Axis 2 (eigenvalue=0.461). Vector fitting of nine measured environmental factors indicated a strong positive correlation with Axis 1 of the ordination, of soil pH, sodium and conductivity, and negative correlations with elevation, soil water, organic matter and potassium contents.

AB  - Many saltmarsh platforms in New England and other northern climates (e.g. Canada, northern Europe) exhibit poor drainage, creating waterlogged regions where short-form Spartina alterniflora dominates and stagnant pools that experience tidal exchange only during spring tides and storm-induced flooding events. The processes related to pool formation and tidal creek incision (via headward erosion) that may eventually drain these features are poorly understood, however it has been suggested that an increase in pool occurrence in recent decades is due to waterlogging stress from sea-level rise. We present evidence here that saltmarshes in Plum Island Estuary of Massachusetts are keeping pace with sea-level rise, and that the recent increase in saltmarsh pool area coincides with changes in drainage density from a legacy of anthropogenic ditching (reversion to natural drainage conditions). Gradients, in addition to elevation and hydroperiod, are critical for saltmarsh pool formation. Additionally, elevation and vegetative changes associated with pool formation, creek incision, subsequent drainage of pools, and recolonization by S. alterniflora are quantified. Pool and creek dynamics were found to be cyclic in nature, and represent platform elevation in dynamic equilibrium with sea level whereby saltmarsh elevation may be lowered (due to degradation of organic matter and formation of a pool), however may be regained on short timescales (10(1-2) yr) with creek incision into pools and restoration of tidal exchange. Rapid vertical accretion is associated with sedimentation and S. alterniflora plant recolonization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - While the development of land for residential housing along the Swan and Canning Rivers in Perth, WA, Australia has reduced natural mosquito breeding sites, the role of backyard container breeding remains a relatively unknown factor. Local Governments responsible for these areas focus management and control efforts on low lying, tidally driven mosquito habitats to control Aedes vigilax (Skuse) and Aedes camptorhynchus (Thomson) mosquitoes in an effort to reduce both the nuisance and disease risk to residents. In spite of their efforts, Local Governments continue to receive complaints regarding mosquito nuisance, even when environmental conditions do not favor hatching and development of the two species in the Swan River tidal flats. In this study, 150 backyard inspections were conducted in the residential suburb of Bassendean, Perth, WA, Australia, situated in close proximity to the Swan River tidal plain. The occurrence and species composition of the mosquito fauna found in residential backyards was documented. Of the backyards inspected, 94% were found to possess containers capable of breeding mosquitoes, although only 3% contained mosquito larvae. Nine species of mosquito were collected from containers ranging in capacity from 0.05 to 50 L across the study area. Additionally, encephalitis virus surveillance trapping was conducted within residential properties and compared to the tidally driven natural habitat at Ashfield Flats and a tidally influenced brackish creekline at Bindaring Park. The species composition of the fauna at the three habitat types differed significantly, with Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) dominating residential lots and A. vigilax more prevalent at the saltmarsh site. Bindaring Park had an adult composition at the mid-point of these two habitats, reflecting its proximity to both the Swan River and residential lots.

AB  - Paleoenvironmental records from a southern California coastal saltmarsh reveal evidence for repeated late Holocene coseismic subsidence events. Field analysis of sediment gouge cores established discrete lithostratigraphic units extend across the wetland. Detailed sediment analyses reveal abrupt changes in lithology, percent total organic matter, grain size, and magnetic susceptibility. Microfossil analyses indicate that predominantly freshwater deposits bury relic intertidal deposits at three distinct depths. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the three burial events occurred in the last 2000 calendar years. Two of the three events are contemporaneous with large-magnitude paleoearthquakes along the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon fault system. From these data, we infer that during large magnitude earthquakes a step-over along the fault zone results in the vertical displacement of an approximately 5-km(2) area that is consistent with the footprint of an estuary identified in pre-development maps. These findings provide insight on the evolution of the saltmarsh, coseismic deformation and earthquake recurrence in a wide area of southern California, and sensitive habitat already threatened by eustatic sea level rise.

AB  - The Tagus Estuary is one of the most Hg-contaminated estuaries in SW Europe. Sediment cores were sampled at two low Hg-contaminated sites inside the natural park, Alcochete (ALC) and Vale Frades (VF), and analyzed for mercury and methylmercury. Concentrations of Hg and MeHg in sediments were below 1 mu g g(-1) and 4.4 ng g(-1), respectively. While in summer organic matter and/or excess SO42 promotes Hg methylation, in winter, Hg availability is the sole driver for methylation. Diffusive fluxes in the sediment/water interface show a sink of Hg species in the ALC site (ca. 170 mg year(-1) of Hg and 60 mg year(-1) of MeHg), while in the VF area, a sink of MeHg (ca. 1900 mg year(-1)) as well as a source of Hg (ca. 2000 mg year(-1)) is observed. The morphology and hydrodynamic regime of the Tagus Estuary seem to influence Hg dynamics even in areas with low levels of Hg contamination.

AB  - The influence of the saltmarsh plant Halimione portucaloides and the level of sediment metal contamination on the distribution of microbial communities were investigated in two Portuguese estuarine systems with different degrees of metal contamination: the Cavado (41.5 N; 8.7 W) and Sado estuaries. In the Sado, two saltmarshes were studied: Lisnave (38.4 N; 8.7 W) and Comporta (38.4 N; 8.8 W). A PCR rDNA-DGGE approach and direct microscopic counts of DAPI-stained cells were applied to study the biodiversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities. Sediment characteristics and metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) were also evaluated to identify possible environmental pollution constraints on spatial and temporal microbial dynamics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the Lisnave saltmarsh microbial community was usually associated with a higher degree of metal contamination, especially the metal Pb. In clear contrast, the Cavado estuary microbial assemblage composition was associated with low metal concentrations but higher organic matter content. The Comporta saltmarsh bacterial community clustered in a separate branch, and was associated with higher levels of different metals, such as Ni, Cr and Zn. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the Lisnave and Cavado showed a seasonal pattern. Moreover, microbial abundance correlated negatively with metal concentrations, being higher at the Cavado estuarine site and with general higher counts in the rhizosediment. These findings suggest that increased metal concentrations negatively affect the abundance of prokaryotic cells and that saltmarsh plants may have a pivotal role in shaping the microbial community structure.

AB  - Suaeda salsa saltmarshes are an important coastal wetland habitat of China's northern Yellow Sea, which plays a critical role in sequestering carbon (blue carbon), protecting shorelines, maintaining biodiversity, and has substantial economic value (e.g., ecotourism). However, the area of S. salsa has been rapidly declining due to several different threats from reclamation and invasive species that impact its natural succession. Here, we map the changes in the distribution of the S. salsa saltmarshes along the northern Yellow Sea of China (NYSC) at 5-year intervals by applying the supervised maximum likelihood method to analyze Landsat images from 1988 to 2018 and investigate the potential impact of three important factors on habitat change by analyzing the temporal changes in S. salsa saltmarshes with other land covers. S. salsa saltmarsh areas have decreased by 63% (264 km(2) ha to 99 km(2)), and the average loss of S. salsa saltmarshes was 5.5 km(2)/year along the NYSC over the past three decades. There have been many dramatic declines in the two main distribution areas of S. salsa saltmarshes with a 77% loss of habitat area in Liaodong Bay (from 112 km(2) to 26 km(2)) and a 52% loss in the Yellow River Delta wetland-Guangli-Zhima estuarine wetland (from 137 km(2) to 65 km(2)). Land reclamation is the most important impact factor in the loss of S. salsa saltmarshes, while there have been limited effects of natural succession and smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) invasion. In light of the important ecological services and economic value of the S. salsa habitat, emergency conservation actions (e.g., habitat restoration, strictly supervision) are needed to limit the rapid habitat loss, which should include the immediate cessation of extensive land reclamation along the NYSC.

AB  - Intertidal grazing crabs play an important role in estuarine ecosystems, transforming carbon fixed by autotrophs into forms available to a wide range of consumers. Whether the autotrophic carbon is derived primarily from intertidal vegetation or microalgae is an important question to be resolved, as the modification of estuaries alters the balance between these potential food sources, and restoration efforts are best guided by an understanding of the primary drivers of ecosystem energy flow. We utilised the mosaic of C-3 and C-4 vegetated patches in a temperate saltmarsh to clarify the relative contributions of potential sources of carbon and nitrogen to the diet of 2 species of grapsid crabs: Paragrapsus laevis and Helograpsis haswellianus. The 2 vegetation communities occupied the same position in relation to tidal elevation. We analysed stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) to discriminate 3 potential sources of dietary carbon using an IsoSource mixing model: microphytobenthos (MPB); fine benthic organic matter (FBOM); and fresh plant material. We found enrichment of delta C-13 and depletion of delta N-15 in crabs sampled from patches of the C-4 grass Sporobolus virginicus, consistent with the use of C-4 derived carbon compared to those sampled in the C-3 chenopod Sarcocornia quinqueflora. However, microphytobenthos was similarly depleted within large patches of S. virginicus, implying uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon originating from plant respiration. Multiple-source mixing (IsoSource) models indicated a primary role for MPB and FBOM in crab diets, with locally derived plant material making little contribution to crab diet. The result contrasts with those of studies from subtropical and tropical systems.

AB  - The inverse relationship between the number of stomata on a leaf surface and the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) in which the leaf developed allows plants to optimise water-use efficiency (WUE), but it also permits the use of fossil plants as proxies of palaeoatmospheric [CO2]. The ancient conifer family Araucariaceae is often represented in fossil floras and may act as a suitable proxy of palaeo-[CO2], yet little is known regarding the stomatal index (SI) responses of extant Araucariaceae to [CO2]. Four Araucaria species (Araucaria columnaris, A. heterophylla, A. angustifolia and A. bidwillii) and Agathis australis displayed no significant relationship in SI to [CO2] below current ambient levels (similar to 380 ppm). However, representatives of the three extant genera within the Araucariaceae (A. bidwillii, A. australis and Wollemia nobilis) all exhibited significant reductions in SI when grown in atmospheres of elevated [CO2] (1,500 ppm). Stomatal conductance was reduced and WUE increased when grown under elevated [CO2]. Stomatal pore length did not increase alongside reduced stomatal density (SD) and SI in the three araucariacean conifers when grown at elevated [CO2]. These pronounced SD and SI reductions occur at higher [CO2] levels than in other species with more recent evolutionary origins, and may reflect an evolutionary legacy of the Araucariaceae in the high [CO2] world of the Mesozoic Era. Araucariacean conifers may therefore be suitable stomatal proxies of palaeo-[CO2] during periods of "greenhouse" climates and high [CO2] in the Earth's history.

AB  - Aims The effects of invasive plants on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are widely documented, while the mechanisms of their influences on the microbial ecology of soil remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore variations in soil bacterial communities following plant invasion, and the mechanisms that drive these changes. Methods An invasive perennial herb, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., was examined via 16S rRNA genetic sequencing analyses, to assess the impacts of plant invasion on soil bacterial communities compared to bare flat and native Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall., Scirpus mariqueter Tang et Wang, and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. communities in the coastal zone of China. Results S. alterniflora invasion significantly increased soil bacterial abundance, species richness, and diversity for soil bacterial communities compared with native communities. S. alterniflora soil revealed a unique bacterial community composition, and possessed the highest relative abundance of chemo-lithoautotrophic bacteria, photoautotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chloroflexi, and Anaerolineae), and saprophytic and copiotrophic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroidetes) among the plant communities. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that invasive S. alterniflora significantly altered soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community composition through increases in nutrient substrate levels and altering soil physiochemical properties. Subsequently, the modification of soil bacterial communities, especially increased relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Anaerolineae, and Bacteroidetes following S. alterniflora invasion can enhance the degradation of recalcitrant S. alterniflora materials, while inducing the accumulation of soil organic C and N. These changes further potentially impacted ecosystem C and N cycles in the coastal zone of China.

AB  - We investigated the effects of tidal inundation and grazing pressure on soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization and plant community characteristics in the predominant plant communities used by breeding black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) in southwestern Alaska. Three plant communities dominate the outer coastal zone, the lowest in elevation being Carex subspathacea grazing lawns, the next being C. ramenskii meadows, and the highest being a slough levee community. We flooded each of these communities in the field with tidal waters (mean total dissolved salts 28.3 +/- 0.7 g L-1) at different frequencies for two growing seasons. Relative to controls, treatments that were flooded weekly had soils that had two-, three-, and six-fold increases in salinity in the C. subspathacea, C. ramenskii, and slough levee communities, respectively. We detected no effect of flooding on either soil carbon or nitrogen mineralization, nor any effect on live plant standing biomass and net aboveground primary productivity in the most coastal communities, those dominated by C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii. Biomass in the slough levee community was lower in plots that had soil salinities six times higher than the ambient soil salinity. This effect resulted from an 83% decline in woody vegetation. Grass biomass, predominately Poa arctica and Deschampsia caespitosa, increased in these plots, however, and maintained the productivity of this community relative to controls. Geese reduced the biomass of a preferred forage species (Triglochin palustris) by 50% over two growing seasons within the slough levee community. Carex subspathacea compensated for the loss of over 95% of its production by geese, even in soils that had twice the ambient salinity. The C. subspathacea and C. ramenskii communities are resistant to short-term tidal inundation and elevated soil salinities, and grazing by geese is responsible for maintaining their community boundaries. Elevated soil salinity and tidal inundation restricts the development of woody vegetation in the slough levee community, but graminoids compensate for the reduction in woody biomass and maintain the overall productivity of this community.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the rates and controls of anaerobic respiration reactions coupled to organic matter mineralization as a function of space and time along a transect from a bioturbated creekbank to the midmarsh in Georgia saltmarsh sediments. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 3 sites during 5 sampling periods throughout the growth season. The sites differed according to hydrologic regime and the abundance of dominant plants and macrofauna. SRR and pore water / solid phase geochemistry showed evidence of enhanced sediment oxidation at sites exposed to intense bioturbation. Iron(III) reduction rates (FeRR) were directly determined in saltmarsh sediments for the first time, and in agreement with measured SRR, higher rates were observed at the bioturbated, unvegetated creekbank (BUC) and bioturbated, vegetated levee (BVL) sites in comparison to a vegetated mid-marsh (MM) site. An unexpected result was the fact that SRR varied nearly as much between sites (2-3 x) as it did with temperature or season (3-4 x). The BVL site, vegetated by the tall form of Spartina alterniflora, always exhibited the highest SRR and carbon oxidation rates (> 4000 nmol cm(-)3 d(-)1) with high activity levels extending deep (greater than or equal to 50 cm) into the sediment, while the MM site, dominated by the short form of Spartina, always exhibited the lowest SRR which were localized to the top 15 cm of sediment. SRR and FeRR at BUC were intermediate between those measured at the BVL and MM. Acetate was the most abundant microbial fermentation product (concentrations up to > 1 mM) in marsh porewaters, and its distribution reflected respiration activity. Chemical exchange, caused by bioturbation, appeared to be the primary control explaining trends in rates of sulfate and Fe(III) reduction with macrophytes and carbon source acting as secondary controls.

AB  - Population dynamics and production of the amphipod, Orchestia gammarellus were studied for two years in a Ria Formosa saltmarsh (southern Portugal). The animals were sampled every 6th week using pitfall traps and core samples. The highest densities were recorded in the organic matter deposits during spring 1999 (core samples) and most intense activity (pitfall traps) during autumn 1998. Females lived for 8-11 months and reached up to 14 mm body length while males lived for 812 months and reached 17 mm body length. Reproduction was continuous and started when females were 6-7 months old. Females produced, on an average, 17 eggs each and fecundity increased with size. Sex ratio was 58% on an annual average. Daily mortality was generally high (0.9%) with higher values in spring/summer (1.8%) and lower in autumn/winter (0.5%). Significant differences in the Von Bertalanffy growth curves were found with males growing faster than females. Annual production has been calculated by the increment summation method as 1.4 g AFDW/m(2) with a corresponding P/B ratio of 3.9. Production rate was highest in spring and summer 1999. It is pointed out that O. gammarellus has adopted an r-strategy to exploit this saltmarsh.

AB  - Few studies have been made on planktonic food webs of temperate ecosystems, especially those from the Southern Atlantic Ocean, using molecular biomarkers. The fatty acid compositions of suspended particulate matter (SPM), microplankton and mesozooplankton were studied during summer and winter at a sewage-impacted and a control site in the Bahia Blanca Estuary (Argentina). The aim was to identify trophic relationships on a spatial and seasonal scale and to detect allochthonous inputs to the food web. Fatty acid trends were consistent with the seasonal succession of the plankton community structure supporting our underlying hypothesis that regional seasonality is mostly responsible for changes in fatty acid composition. Sewage had no clear impact on the fatty acids and may not be a significant source of SPM in the estuary. However, at the sewage site the composition of the SPM was more related to terrestrially derived compounds, diatoms and bacteria, and mesozooplankton fatty acids suggested grazing on terrestrial components and on diatoms over flagellates. Saltmarshes likely have a crucial role as the main contributors to the organic fraction of SPM followed by plankton. The seasonal fatty acid pattern of the mesozooplankton indicated different feeding strategies suggesting an active feeding mode during summer and a more terrestrially associated diet in winter. The fatty acid trophic marker approach provided relevant information to clarify planktonic trophic interactions and to trace the origin of organic matter in this highly dynamic temperate coastal system.

AB  - The recent listing of saltmarsh in northern New South Wales, Australia, as an endangered ecological community has highlighted the need to rehabilitate damaged saltmarsh and create new areas to offset losses. Land managers require scientific measurements of the early stages of restoration for adaptive management but the interpretation of the data should account for environmental factors. In this study of a degraded and rehabilitated subtropical saltmarsh on the east coast of Australia, measurements of the changes in the soil microalgal community using chlorophyll a showed the differences between reference sites and treatment sites. Analyses of across-site variables showed that solar radiation, rainfall, and tidal inundation influenced microalgal growth, highlighting the importance of seasonal studies. Microalgal abundances showed relationships with developing site variables such as percentage soil moisture, total organic carbon, and total nitrogen. MDS analyses using chlorophyll a showed that the restoration sites were progressing towards, but were not equivalent to the reference state in the short time since restoration (two years) despite the fast growth rates of soil algae.

AB  - Seasonal variations in anaerobic respiration pathways were investigated at three saltmarsh sites using chemical data, sulfate reduction rate measurements, enumerations of culturable populations of anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB), and quantification of in situ 16S rRNA hybridization signals targeted for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Bacterial sulfate reduction in the sediments followed seasonal changes in temperature and primary production of the saltmarsh, with activity levels lowest in winter and highest in summer. In contrast, a dramatic decrease in the FeRB population size was observed during summer at all sites. The collapse of FeRB populations during summer was ascribed to high rates of sulfide production by SRB, resulting in abiotic reduction of bioavailable Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. To test this hypothesis, sediment slurry incubations at 10, 20 and 30degreesC were carried out. Increases in temperature and labile organic carbon availability (acetate or lactate additions) increased rates of sulfate reduction while decreasing the abundance of culturable anaerobic FeRB. These trends were not reversed by the addition of amorphous Fe(III) (hydr) oxides to the slurries. However, when sulfate reduction was inhibited by molybdate, no decline in FeRB growth was observed with increasing temperature. Addition of dissolved sulfide adversely impacted propagation of FeRB whether molybdate was added or not. Both field and laboratory data therefore support a sulfide-mediated limitation of microbial iron respiration by SRB. When total sediment respiration rates reach their highest levels during summer, SRB force a decline in the FeRB populations. As sulfate reduction activity slows down after the summer, the FeRB are able to recover.

AB  - The saltmarsh plant Spartina alterniflora was introduced to the Jiangsu coasts, China and serves as an ecological engineer to reduce near-bed shear stress, trap fine-grained sediments and protect the coast from wave-induced erosion. The saltmarshes thus could record the Spartina colonization-driven changes within the sedimentary layers. Based on these ecological and sedimentological changes in sediments, we present a new eco-parametric method to estimate the sedimentation rate for the newly-formed wetlands in the Yancheng Wetland Nature Reserve for Rare Birds, Jiangsu. Sediment cores and satellite imagery were used to identify the thickness of accumulated sediment layers and the time since the Spartina colonization. We defined the original ground on which Spartina alterniflora initially colonized using pigment concentrations, grain size and stable carbon isotopic compositions of organic matter (delta C-13) in sediments. We also determined the time mark of the Spartina colonization by examining the Landsat images over 1982-2018 to discriminate the Spartina alterniflora from other native plants and geomorphological features. These two datasets yielded a sedimentation rate of 3.3 cm/yr for Core A and of 9.6 cm/yr for Core B, the latter evidenced by an increase of similar to 0.51 m in the bed level from 2008 to 2014. Combining the Pb-210 dating method, we further estimated the sedimentation rate for the layers beneath the original ground, which was comparable to that of the bare flats in the Jiangsu coast. Even though this new method is only applicable to newly-formed saltmarshes, it helps identify the recent sedimentation events as well as reveal the environmental changes and the evolution of saltmarsh-bare flat systems due to the interplay between vegetation, hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. It thus could be an efficient and cost-effective tool for an improved understanding of the response of coastal wetlands to a changing climate/environment. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Global climate change is driving the expansion of mangroves into saltmarsh habitat, which may alter the rate and magnitude of organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling due to differences in the structural complexity, litter quality, and other ecophysiological traits of foundation species. This work quantified and compared aboveground litter decomposition of the range-expanding mangrove,Avicennia germinans,and resident saltmarsh cordgrass,Spartina alterniflora, and decomposition of a standard substrate belowground, in the saltmarsh and saltmarsh-mangrove ecotone habitat along the Atlantic coast of Florida, USA. Plant and soil fractions were tested for natural abundances of delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes to elucidate soil nutrient sources. Although aboveground decomposition rates differed between marsh and mangrove species due to differences in litter quality, decomposition rates did not vary between saltmarsh and ecotonal habitats. Decay rates were higher forA. germinansleaf litter (0.007 +/- 0.0003 k day(-1)) than forS. alterniflora(0.004 +/- 0.0003 k day(-1)) regardless of habitat, which suggests that increasing inputs ofA. germinanslitter with encroachment may increase nutrient availability through rapid turnover. Furthermore, belowground decomposition was similar between habitats (0.015 +/- 0.0008 k day(-1)), whereas soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes differed significantly. Collectively, these results suggest that mangrove encroachment may not modify the environmental factors driving decomposition, but alterations in foundation plant species may ultimately alter nutrient cycling within habitats through shifts in litter quality.

AB  - Seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica represent hotspots of productivity in the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea. The lack of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the seawater suggests that the N-demand of these meadows might be in part supported by microbial dinitrogen (N-2) fixation. However, currently there are no direct N-2 fixation measurements available for this productive marine macrophyte. Here we investigated N-2 fixation activity associated with P. oceanica leaf, rhizome and root pieces. In 15N(2) incubations, the roots exhibited highest rates of N-2 fixation. The rates varied considerably between replicates, presumably due to a patchy microbial colonization of the roots. Additions of organic carbon compounds (acetate, glucose, sucrose or algal lysate) did not enhance the N-2 fixation rates. Sulfate reduction rates measured alongside were also highest in root incubations. Correspondingly, sequences of the nifH gene (a marker gene for the iron protein of the N-2-fixing enzyme nitrogenase) related to known sulfate-reducing bacteria were retrieved from P. oceanica roots. Other nifH sequences clustered with known heterotrophic diazotrophs previously identified in other marine macrophytes. In particular, many sequences obtained from P. oceanica roots were similar (>94%) to a saltmarsh rhizosphere-associated heterotrophic diazotroph, indicating that heterotrophic lifestyle might be common among marine macrophyte-associated diazotrophs.

AB  - Saltmarshes are areas of vegetation subject to tidal inundation and are important to birds for several reasons. Saltmarshes are areas of high primary productivity and their greatest significance for coastal birds is probably as the base of estuarine food webs, because saltmarshes export considerable amounts of organic carbon to adjacent habitats, particularly to the invertebrates of mudflats. In addition, saltmarshes are of direct importance to birds by providing sites for feeding, nesting and roosting. Climate change can affect saltmarshes in a number of ways, including through sea-level rise. When sea-level rises the marsh vegetation moves upward and inland but sea walls that prevent this are said to lead to coastal squeeze and loss of marsh area. However, evidence from southeast England, and elsewhere, indicates that sea-level rise does not necessarily lead to loss of marsh area because marshes accrete vertically and maintain their elevation with respect to sea-level where the supply of sediment is sufficient. Organogenic marshes and those in areas where sediment may be more limiting (e.g. some west coast areas) may be more susceptible to coastal squeeze, as may other marshes, if some extreme predictions of accelerated rates of sea-level rise are realized.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the Guadiana Estuary contains metal concentrations in excess of background values. Therefore, this work aims to document the potential environmental hazards associated with the availability of these metals in this environment of high ecological value. Mineralogical analysis shows that the sediments are composed mainly of quartz, albite, and clay minerals (illite, smectite, kaolinite, and vermiculite) along with several small, reactive compounds (including soluble sulphated salts. Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, organic matter, and pyrite) capable of retaining metals, which can be subsequently released, causing environmental degradation. BCR sequential extraction shows that As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn present mobile fractions with respect to the total metal content (41, 100, 57, 53, 70, and 69%, respectively) in any of the described reactive phases (Fl + F2 + F3). Calculated environmental risk indices demonstrate moderate to considerable ecological risk for almost the entire estuary, associated mainly with acid mine drainage from the nearby Iberian Pyrite Belt. In addition, the indices highlight several zones of extremely high risk, which are related to industrial and urban dumps in the vicinity of the estuary and to heavy traffic on the international bridge.

AB  - A low-energy saltmarsh in the Beaulieu River Estuary, southern England was investigated. A geomorphological survey revealed that the creek bank geometry was characterized by the presence of cantilevers, a result of the protection provided by roots over the upper part of the bank. The saltmarsh deposits, consisting mainly of clay and organic matter, have a high resistance to flow-induced erosion. Short-term hydrographic deployments revealed that the tidal currents and waves recorded were insufficient to cause erosion of the bank surface. However, pin measurements over a 2-year period revealed that the tidal creeks within the saltmarsh did experience bank erosion, particularly below the cantilevers, in spite of this low-energy setting. Bank face erosion was therefore considered to be related to long-term processes. The bases of the cantilevers were found to be located at a precise level, in relation to the tides. Water level data over a 2-year period were examined against erosion measured below the cantilevers. The results suggest that the erosion on the bank faces, particularly below the cantilevers, is associated with the frequency of water level variations and long-term submergence/emergence cycles, which can decrease the bonds between the particles and enable erosion by low tidal and wind-wave currents within this low-energy environment. This mechanism is probably responsible for tidal creek enlargement via erosion of the bank face and subsequent bank failure, a process which acts over a long temporal scale (1-10 years).

AB  - Traditionally, studies on vegetation succession have focused either on plant-plant interactions or on interactions between plants and their physical environment, for example through organic matter build-up and increased nutrient cycling. These interactions can change conditions for macrodetritivores that feed on plant litter, but their role in vegetation succession is rarely studied. In this paper, we explore whether the bioturbating crustacean macrodetritivore Orchestia gammarellus alters soil conditions in a saltmarsh ecosystem in such a way that it promotes late-successional, less stress-tolerant plant species at the expense of early successional species. To answer this, we performed a field and a laboratory experiment in which we manipulated abundances of O.gammarellus, and studied the consequences for soil physical and chemical parameters and for vegetation community composition. Our field experiment showed that O.gammarellus stimulated nitrogen mineralization, likely resulting from the positive effect of this macrodetritivore on soil aeration and litter decomposition. Moreover, results from the laboratory experiment showed that O.gammarellus negatively affected dicot seedling survival of mainly early successional plant species, likely through grazing, thus affecting plant community composition. The experiments together provided evidence that O.gammarellus promotes late-successional plant species in multiple ways: by alleviation of anoxic conditions, by promoting nutrient cycling and by selective herbivory on early successional species.Synthesis. By demonstrating that a species traditionally considered as part of the detrital (brown') food web is thus an important accelerator of vegetation succession, this study documents an important but often overlooked link in food web and ecosystem ecology.

AB  - This article presents new biostratigraphic dating, facies analysis, organic geochemical data and Nd-Sr isotopic provenance from five outcrops of southern Amazonia (MD-85, MD-177 MD-184, MD-255 and MD-256) to document for the first time the presence of a shallow marine ingression in the Paleocene of southern Amazonia basin. The co-occurrence of a selachian assemblage encompassing Potobatis sp., Ouledia sp., and Pristidae indet with the ostracod Protobuntonia sp. and the charophytes Peckichara cf. varians meridionalis, Platychara perlata, and Feistiella cf. gildemeisteri suggests a Paleocene age for the studied deposits (most likely Thanetian but potentially Danian). Fifteen fades have been recognized and have been grouped into three facies assemblages. Facies association A corresponds to the sedimentary filling of a tide-influenced meandering channel formed in the fluvial-tidal transition zone. Facies association B is related to more distal tidal-flats, little channelized tidal inlets and saltmarsh deposits. Facies association C corresponds to a stressed shallow marine environment such as a bay or a lagoon. The delta C-13(TOC) value (- 23.4%) of MD-184 is enriched in C-13 compared to the other samples suggesting the presence of substantial amounts of marine organic matter in MD-184. The delta C-13(TOC) values of samples from other outcrops ( - 27.3 to - 29.8%) indicate a mixed organic matter origin, from terrestrial to brackish environments. The analyzed sediments have similar Nd-Sr isotopic compositions as those of the Cenozoic sediments of the Altiplano (epsilon Nd(0) values from - 6.2 to - 10.7 and Sr-87/Sr-86 compositions from 0.712024 to 0.719026) indicating a similar volcanic source. This multidisciplinary dataset documents the presence of a tide-dominated estuary sourced by the proto-Westem Cordillera debouching into a shallow marine bay during Paleocene times. This transgression might be explained by subsidence created in response to the proto-Western Cordillera loading. Similar to Miocene marine incursions affecting the Pebas megawetland, Paleogene marine incursions in the Amazonian foreland basin associated with Andean uplift may have played a role in the Neotropical biodiversity dynamics in favoring biogeographical isolation and promoting allopatric speciation for terrestrial organisms.

AB  - Biffarius arenosus had a mean delta(13)C of -15.4 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and a mean delta(15)N of 5.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (n = 38), and Trypea australiensis had a mean delta(13)C of -16.3 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand and a mean delta(15)N of 7.6 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (n = 20). The delta(13)C signatures of the only mangrove species present (Avicennia marina) and the most abundant saltmarsh plant (Sarcocornia quinqueflola) indicated that they were not major food sources. Seagrasses, predominantly Heterozostera tasmanica, had mean delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of -11.7 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand (n = 65) and 3.9 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand (n = 62), respectively. Seagrass epiphytes had mean delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of -17.9 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand and 4.6 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand (n = 27), respectively. A mixture of seagrasses and their epiphytes was the most likely source of organic carbon for B. arenosus. Benthic microalgae, such as diatoms, were a possible food source, but phospholipid biomarkers indicated a meagre abundance of diatoms in the sediments, and microscopy of shrimp guts revealed few or no diatom frustules. For T. australiensis, food sources were less easily distinguished than for B. arenosus, but they could include seagrass epiphytes plus the green macroalgae Enteromorpha spp, and/or the brown alga Chordaria cladisiphon.

AB  - Humus-rich saltmarsh soils near the Sehestedter Aubetaendeichsmoor at the German North Sea coast are considered to be a source for methane. To get more information on the extent of methanogenesis and its influencing factors in the seasonal course we investigated the methane dynamics in long-term experiments. The methane concentrations were mostly 0-2 mumol g(-1) in the topsoil and 0->10 mumol g(-1) in the subsoil, thus showing increasing values and increasing variability with increasing soil depths. With significant positive correlations to the methane concentrations the methane production rates were often in the range of 100-200 mmol g(-1) d(-1). The sulfate concentrations were 0->10 mM in the topsoil and mostly 0-2 mM in the subsoil, showing an inverse behaviour as compared to the methane dynamics, expressed by the highly negative correlation coefficient and indicating that competitive substrates are the predominant cause for the intense methanogenesis. Allochthonous organic matter is the cause for the natural or geological eutrophy of this site. The SO42-/Cl- ratios ranged from 0.01 -0.11 in the topsoil and from 0-0.03 in the subsoil, showing that sulfate reduction prevails over sulfate oxidation with increasing soil depths. The temporal variability of the methane dynamics indicated that besides substrates the redox potential is an important factor controlling methanogenesis. Methane emission rates were highly variable with up to 120 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the areas with vegetation and even up to 7751 mg m(-2) d(-1) in those without vegetation, clearly revealing the soils to be a source for methane.

AB  - Sediment retention in saltmarshes is often attributed to the presence of vegetation, which enhances accretion by slowing water flow, reduces erosion by attenuating wave energy and increases surface stability through the presence of organic matter. Saltmarsh vegetation morphology varies considerably on a range of spatial and temporal scales, but the effect of different above ground morphologies on sediment retention is not well characterised. Understanding the biophysical interaction between the canopy and sediment trapping in situ is important for improving numerical shoreline models. In a novel field flume study, we measured the effect of vegetation height and biomass on sediment trapping using a mass balance approach. Suspended sediment profilers were placed at both openings of a field flume built across-shore on the seaward boundary of an intertidal saltmarsh in the Dengie Peninsula, UK. Sequential removal of plant material from within the flume resulted in incremental loss of vegetation height and biomass. The difference between the concentration of suspended sediment measured at each profiler was used to determine the sediment budget within the flume. Deposition of material on the plant/soil surfaces within the flume occurred during flood tides, while ebb flow resulted in erosion (to a lesser degree) from the flume area, with a positive sediment budget of on average 6.5 g m(-2) tide(-1) with no significant relationship between sediment trapping efficiency and canopy morphology. Deposition (and erosion) rates were positively correlated to maximum inundation depth. Our results suggest that during periods of calm conditions, changes to canopy morphology do not result in significant changes in sediment budgets in marshes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mercury and other heavy metals have been monitored in the surface sediments of the Mersey Estuary in NW England for a period of 25 years, using a consistent methodology and sampling grid. This has produced one of the most comprehensive data sets available in the literature and demonstrated some of the difficulties associated with undertaking long-term environmental monitoring. The data indicate that the concentration of mercury and other metals in the sediments of this estuary are strongly correlated to the organic matter and particle size content. This has resulted in the metal distribution patterns reflecting the sediment characteristics and dynamics, irrespective of the position of the input sources. The trend data has indicated a continual, although somewhat uneven, decline in the concentration of most of the metals studied. Remobilisation of previously consolidated saltmarsh sediments can cause significant perturbations in contaminant reduction trends, and needs to be considered in the design of long term monitoring programmes.

AB  - Using in situ porous cup samplers, dissolved Pu concentrations have been measured over a year in the pore waters from two contrasting sites in the valley of the River Esk, North West England. In saltmarsh sediments, dissolved Pu represents approximately 1 part in 10(6) of the total inventory. The Pu concentration in solution is in the range 1.1-3.5 mBq l(-1), varying by a factor of 3 in the course of the year. Most of the changes in dissolved Pu coincide with changes in dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations, with Pu being low in the summer months when Fe and Mn are high. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors which make it unclear as to whether these patterns might be related to seasonal redox changes in the saltmarsh. At the highly organic, reducing reedbed site, the proportion of Pu in solution is typically around 1 part in 10(3), proportionately much higher than in the saltmarsh, giving concentrations ranging between 9.0 and 28.5 mBq l(-1), and are apparently maintained by complexation to dissolved organic matter. There is no obvious seasonal pattern at the reedbed site nor is there any relation to any of the dissolved species measured (Fe, Mn, Na, DOG). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Taihu Plain of the Lower Yangtze valley, China was a centre of rice agriculture during the Neolithic period. Reasons for the rapid development of rice cultivation during this period, however, have not been fully understood for this coastal lowland, which is highly sensitive to sea-level change. To improve understanding of the geomorphological and hydrological context for evolution of prehistoric rice agriculture, two sediment cores (DTX4 and DTX10) in the East Tiaoxi River Plain, south Taihu Plain, were collected, and analysed for radiocarbon dating, diatoms, organic carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15), grain size and lithology. These multiproxy analyses revealed that prior to ca. 7500 cal. yr BP, the East Tiaoxi River Plain was a rapidly aggrading high-salinity estuary (the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary). After ca. 7500 cal. yr BP, low salinity conditions prevailed as a result of strong Yangtze freshwater discharge. Subsequently, seawater penetration occurred and saltmarsh developed between ca. 7000 and 6500 cal. yr BP due to accelerated relative sea-level rise. This transgression event influenced a large area of the Taihu Plain during the Holocene, as shown by multiple sediment records from previous studies. Persistent freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) formed due to dramatic shrinkage/closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary after ca. 5600 cal. yr BP when sea level was relatively stable. We speculate that geomorphological and hydrological changes of the East Tiaoxi River Plain played an important role in agricultural development across the Taihu Plain during the Neolithic period. The closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary and the formation of stable freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) after ca. 5600 cal. yr BP were critical preconditions encouraging the rapid rise of rice productivity in the Liangzhu period (5500-4500 cal. yr BP). This development changed the landscape and river systems, and thus provided adequate freshwater supply to the Taihu Plain.

AB  - A tidal saltmarsh supporting marine ecosystem services becomes more recognized, but an understanding of its trophic dynamics is far limited. We investigated the benthic food-web dynamics in Ganghwa tidal flat, a representative tidal saltmarsh of South Korea The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratio values were analyzed for the sixteen species of macrobenthos and their potential food sources such as microphytobenthos (MPB) and various organic matters. A year-round survey was conducted in the three sites at Ganghwa showing the different types of sediment bottom (sandy mud or mud) and/or vegetation (Phragmites or Suaeda). In general, the isotopic signature fairly well demonstrated that trophic structure is primarily influenced by sediment mud content and/or dominated vegetation. Among the four feeding types of consumers (filter feeder; deposit feeder; omnivore; carnivore), the deposit feeders such as mollusk arthropod, and annelid showed increased dietary dependency on MPB at bare sites. Whilst they actively utilized C-13-depleted organic matters at vegetated sites. Meantime, significantly enriched stable nitrogen isotopic ratio of macrobenthos was evidenced in fall, which reflected the seasonal variation of food sources and physiological processes in survival strategy. Overall, the stable isotopic approach was useful to address the key factors (in)directly influencing the benthic food web structure and its functioning in a typical tidal saltmarsh of the Yellow Sea.

AB  - Estuaries are important subcomponents of the coastal ocean, but knowledge about the temporal and spatial variability of their carbonate chemistry, as well as their contribution to coastal and global carbon fluxes, are limited. In the present study, we measured the temporal and spatial variability of biogeochemical parameters in a saltmarsh estuary in Southern California, the San Dieguito Lagoon (SDL). We also estimated the flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total organic carbon (TOC) to the adjacent coastal ocean over diel and seasonal timescales. The combined net flux of DIC and TOC (FDIC + TOC) to the ocean during outgoing tides ranged from - 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(3) to 9.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(3) mol C h(-1) during baseline conditions. Based on these fluxes, a rough estimate of the net annual export of DIC and TOC totaled 10 +/- 4 x 10(6) mol C year(-1). Following a major rain event (36 mm rain in 3 days), FDIC + TOC increased and reached values as high as 29.0 +/- 0.7 x 10(3) mol C h(-1). Assuming a hypothetical scenario of three similar storm events in a year, our annual net flux estimate more than doubled to 25 +/- 4 x 10(6) mol C year(-1). These findings highlight the importance of assessing coastal carbon fluxes on different timescales and incorporating event scale variations in these assessments. Furthermore, for most of the observations elevated levels of total alkalinity (TA) and pH were observed at the estuary mouth relative to the coastal ocean. This suggests that SDL partly buffers against acidification of adjacent coastal surface waters, although the spatial extent of this buffering is likely small.

AB  - As an aggressive invasive saltmarsh plant in many places worldwide, Spartina alterniflora has a wide distribution range in latitude. Previous studies have explored latitudinal trends in S. alterniflora productivity in its native regions using meta- analysis, whereas to the best of our knowledge, that in China as its largest invaded regions have not been reported. In this study, we performed meta-analysis to explore latitudinal trends in productivity as measured by the end-of-season-live (EOSL) biomass of S. alterniflora along a broad latitudinal gradient from 24 degrees N to 34 degrees N on the coast of China. The results showed that in stark contrast to the linear decreasing trend found along the East Coast of North America as its native region, the latitudinal variation of the consolidated EOSL biomass along the coast of China exhibited an erratic "W"-shape and fell within the range of variation of the surveyed biomass reported in the literature. Additionally, the EOSL biomass was not correlated with climatic factors, such as the mean annual temperature and mean annual growing degree-days. The results of this study complement the ever-growing literature of S. alterniflora in China from a consolidated perspective and indicate that the response of S. alterniflora productivity to climate change could be more complicated in invaded regions.

AB  - Symbiotic N-2-fixing microorganisms have a crucial role in the assimilation of nitrogen by eukaryotes in nitrogen-limited environments(1-3). Particularly among land plants, N-2-fixing symbionts occur in a variety of distantly related plant lineages and often involve an intimate association between host and symbiont2,4. Descriptions of such intimate symbioses are lacking for seagrasses, which evolved around 100 million years ago from terrestrial flowering plants that migrated back to the sea(5). Here we describe an N-2-fixing symbiont, 'Candidatus Celerinatantimonas neptuna', that lives inside seagrass root tissue, where it provides ammonia and amino acids to its host in exchange for sugars. As such, this symbiosis is reminiscent of terrestrial N-2-fixing plant symbioses. The symbiosis between Ca. C. neptuna and its host Posidonia oceanica enables highly productive seagrass meadows to thrive in the nitrogen-limited Mediterranean Sea. Relatives of Ca. C. neptuna occur worldwide in coastal ecosystems, in which they may form similar symbioses with other seagrasses and saltmarsh plants. Just like N-2-fixing microorganisms might have aided the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils by early land plants(6), the ancestors of Ca. C. neptuna and its relatives probably enabled flowering plants to invade nitrogen-poor marine habitats, where they formed extremely efficient blue carbon ecosystems(7).

AB  - Sediments and the associated biota constitute an important compartment in the biogeochemical cycle of trace metals in soft substrate megatidal estuaries. The relationship between physicochemical, ecological properties, metal concentrations determined in megatidal estuary sediments from the French coast of the English Channel, the Baie des Veys and the macrobenthic organisms, are analysed, interpreted and reported. Total concentrations of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper were measured in mudflats and saltmarsh sediments using Differential Pulse Voltammetry. Sediment characteristics were obtained by measurement of particle size, water content, total organic carbon and carbonate content, using AFNOR standards. A semi-quantitative scale was used for assessing the density of the macrobenthic flora and fauna at each sampling site. Analysis of data obtained from this study showed a correlation between the concentrations of monitored trace metals and species of the macrobenthic fauna. The results of this study show that the physico-chemical characteristics of the sediments affect the retention of metals in the sediment and this in turn affects the biota.

AB  - Factors controlling the spatial distribution of benthic sulfate reduction (SR) were investigated at 3 stations [upper (UB), mid (MB) and lower bay (LB)] along the Chesapeake Bay (eastern USA) central channel from early spring through late fall, 1989 to 1994. Annual rates of Oto 12 cm depth-integrated SR were 0.96, 9.62 and 6.33 mol S m(-2) yr(-1) for UB, MB and LB, respectively, as calculated from (SO42-)-S-35 incubations. SR was carbon limited at UB, LB, and at the sediment surface at MB, and SO42- limited at depth at MB. Temperature explained 33 to 68 % of the variability in annual rates, with an apparent influence on SR which increased in the seaward direction in surface sediments. We speculate that the enhanced response of SR to temperature in LB surface sediments was linked to seasonal variations in macrofaunal activity associated with temperature. Estimates of reduced-S burial indicated that only 4 to 8% of sulfur reduced annually was buried as Fe-S minerals at MB and LB, with the remainder presumably being reoxidized. In contrast, >50% of the sulfur reduced annually was buried at UB, due to comparatively low SR rates and the high concentration of reactive iron in the oligohaline region. SR mineralized 18 to 32% of the annual primary production. Our results indicate that organic quality may be more important than the absolute quantity of organic loading in dictating the magnitude of benthic SR rates along an estuarine gradient. Spatial trends in SR reflected the combined influence of deposited organic matter quality and quantity, SO42- availability, the presence or absence of benthic macrofauna, overlying water dissolved O-2 conditions, reduced-S reoxidation dynamics, and iron-sulfide mineral formation.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) dynamics was evaluated in contaminated sediments and overlying waters from Tagus estuary, in two sites with different Hg anthropogenic sources: Cala Norte (CNOR) and Barreiro (BRR). Environmental factors affecting methylmercury (MMHg) production and Hg and MMHg fluxes across sediment/water interface were reported. [THg] and [MMHg] in solids (0.31-125 mu g g(-1) and 0.76-201 ng g(-1), respectively) showed high variability with higher values in BRR. Porewater [MMHg] (0.1-63 ng L-1, 0.5-86% of THg) varied local and seasonally; higher contents were observed in the summer campaign, thus increasing sediment toxicity affecting the sediment/water Hg (and MMHg) fluxes. In CNOR and BRR sediments, Hg availability and organic carbon were the main factors controlling MMHg production. Noteworthy, an upward MMHg diffusive flux was observed in winter that was inverted in summer. Although MMHg production increases in warmer month, the MMHg concentrations in overlying water increase in a higher proportion compared to the levels in porewaters. This opposite trend could be explained by different extension of MMHg demethylation in the water column. The high concentrations of Hg and MMHg and their dynamics in sediments are of major concern since they can cause an exportation of Hg from the contaminated areas up to ca. 14,600 mg year(-1) and anMMHg deposition of up to ca. 6000 mg year(-1). The results suggest that sediments from contaminated areas of Tagus estuary should be considered as a primary source of Hg for the water column and a sink of MMHg to the sedimentary column.

AB  - The distribution and geochemical characterisation of coastal acid sulfate soils (CASS) in Victoria in southern Australia is relatively poorly understood. This study investigated and characterised CASS and sulfidic material at four sites (wetland (WE), swamp scrub (SS), woodland (WO) and coastal tussock saltmarsh (CTS)) on the estuarine floodplain of the Anglesea River in southern Australia. Shell material and seawater buffered acidity generated and provided acid-neutralising capacity (up to 10.65% CaCO3-equivalent) at the sites located on the lower estuarine floodplain (WO and CTS). The SS site, located on the upper estuarine floodplain, can potentially acidify soil and water due to high positive net acidity (>200 molH(+)t(-1)) and a limited acid-neutralising capacity. High titratable actual acidity in the SS and WO profiles (>270 molH(+)t(-1)) were the result of high organic matter in peat-like layers that can potentially contribute organic acids in addition to acidity formed from oxidation of sulfidic sediments. The results of the present study suggest that the environments and chemistry of acid sulfate soils in southern Australia are distinct from those located in eastern Australia; this may be related to differences in estuarine processes that affect formation of acid sulfate soils, as well as the geomorphology and geology of the catchment.

AB  - Sulfidic sediments are a source of dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) to the ocean but the fate of sedimentary DOS in the oxic, sunlit water column is unknown. We hypothesized that photodegradation after discharge from the dark sedimentary environment results in DOS molecular transformation and decomposition. To test this hypothesis, sulfidic porewater from a saltmarsh was exposed to potential abiotic transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water column. We quantitatively investigated DOM transformations via elemental analysis and molecularly via ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Our study indicated that photoreactivity is dependent on DOM elemental composition as DOS molecular formulas were more photolabile than those without sulfur. Prior to solar irradiation, of the 6451 identified molecular formulas in sulfidic porewater, 39% contained sulfur. After 29 days of irradiation, the DOS concentration was depleted from 13 to 1 mu M, together with a 9% decrease in the number of DOS molecular formulas. Comparing porewater and oceanic DOS molecular formulas, solar irradiation increased the similarity due to the removal of photolabile DOS formulas not present in the ocean. In conclusion, DOS from sulfidic sediments is preferentially photolabile and solar irradiation can be a potential mechanism controlling the stability and fate of porewater DOS.

AB  - Reproductive traits of an estuarine crab, Neohelice (= Chasmagnathus) granulata (Dana 185 1), were compared between individuals living in contrasting habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh) of the same population in the brackish coastal lagoon of Mar Chiquita, Argentina. In both habitats, most measures of egg biomass decreased during embryogenesis, including total dry weight (DW) and organic matter (measured as ash-free dry weight, AFDW) per egg, the contents of ash, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (per egg and as percentage values of DW), the energy content (estimated from C; both per egg and per Dig DW), and the C/N and C/H mass ratios. Egg size, wet weight (WW), and water content (in mu g and % of WW) by contrast, increased significantly during the time of embroynic development. These parameters reached significantly higher final (near-to-hatching) values in mudflats than in saltmarshes (egg volume 0.0249 vs 0.0233 mm(3); WW 36.5 vs 28.8 mu g; water content 30.7 vs 23.2 mu g per egg or 84.2 vs 80.2% of WW, respectively). Fecundity and reproductive effort did not differ significantly between habitats. Habitat-specific differences in the water content and size of crab eggs are discussed in relation to small-scale local variation in environmental conditions.

AB  - By means of benthic landers, sediment core incubations and the whole core squeezing (WCS) technique, benthic exchange and mineralization rates were investigated in 4 different fjords of Arctic Norway (Svalbard). These coastal sediments experience constant low temperatures close td 0 degrees C. The sediments were dominated by large densities of bioirrigating macrofauna, which enhanced the benthic in situ Oz uptake by a factor of 1.8 to 2.9 over the diffusive mediated uptake. Recovered sediment cores significantly underestimated the in situ solute exchange rate, presumably due to exclusion of fauna. Faunal activity in situ additionally resulted in a complex sediment structure, which created a smearing of chemical profiles when applying the WCS technique. The benthic exchange rates of dissolved inorganic carbon determined in situ varied between 9 and 20 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the different stations. Denitrification was of minor importance for benthic mineralization, and the C/N ratio of the effluxing inorganic solutes was close to 10, indicating that relatively fresh organic material was mineralized. The sediment accumulation rate was estimated from Pb-210 profiles to be in the range of 1.3 to 5.9 mm yr(-1). Assuming that our estimated mineralization rates approach the yearly average, it was calculated that 31 to 47 % of the organic carbon reaching the sediment surface was permanently buried. Benthic mineralization rates and carbon burial rates were similar to those obtained in coastal sediments of temperate and tropical regions. This indicates that benthic communities in Arctic sediments rather than being limited by low temperatures are Limited by carbon availability.

AB  - Climate change is a global problem and across the world the transport sector is finding it difficult to break projected increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; there are very few contexts where deep reductions in transport CO2 emissions are being made. A number of research studies are now examining the potential for future lower CO2 emissions in the transport sector. This paper develops this work to consider some of the wider sustainability impacts (economic, social and local environmental) as well as the lower CO2 transport impacts of different policy trajectories. Hence the central argument made is for an integrated approach to transport policy making over the longer term - incorporating scenario analysis and multi-criteria assessment (MCA) - to help assess likely progress against a range of objectives.
   The analysis is based on work carried out in Oxfordshire, UK. Different packages of measures are selected and two scenarios developed which satisfy lower CO2 aspirations, one of which also provides wider positive sustainability impacts. A simulation model has been produced to help explore the strategic policy choices and tensions evident for decision-makers involved in local transport planning. The paper argues for a 'strategic conversation' (Van der Heijden, 1996) at the sub-regional and city level, based upon future scenario analysis and MCA, discussing the priorities for intervention. Such an approach will help us examine the scale of change and trade-offs required in moving towards sustainable transport futures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To understand the biogeochemical cycles of trace metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn) in a hypersaline subtropical marsh, geochemical studies of both interstitial and solid phases were conducted on sediment cores from Chiricahueto marsh, SE Gulf of California. The sequential extraction procedure proposed by Tessier was used to estimate the percentages of the metals present in each geochemical phase of the sediment. Metal concentrations in the solid phase were found to be enriched in the upper layers and mainly associated with reactive fractions such as organic matter, Fe - Mn oxyhydroxides and carbonates (46 - 74% of Ni, Mn and Cd, and 11 - 19% of Cu and Zn). Principal factor analysis (PFA) and Spearman correlation analysis revealed a strong positive association of metals and their reactive phases with OC (the diagenetic component), and a negative or non-association with the mud content, Al, Fe and Li (the lithogenic component). Diagenetically released metals are mainly mobilized within hypersaline sediments by buoyancy transport (> 90% of total flux) in response to an extreme salinity gradient by input of fresh groundwater (3 - 6 psu cm(-1)). The. molecular diffusion due to the gradient of metals in porewater (maximum and higher levels at 5 - 7 and below 20 cm depth, respectively) is significantly less important to the advective transport. Most of the metals mobilized by diffusion - advection processes are re-precipitated in the sediments by authigenic minerals, only < 10% of most metals are extruded out to the overlying water column. Authigenic accumulation rates were estimated as 1.42 - 7.09 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Cd; 58.8 - 378 for Cu; 6922 - 17,985 for Fe; 38.2 - 345 for Mn; 20.8 - 263 for Ni; and 282 - 2956 mg m(-2) a(-1) for Zn. The Mn - Fe oxyhydroxides (40 - 85% of reactive metals) in the upper oxic - suboxic layers (< 5 cm below surface) and sulfide minerals (75 - 97%) in anoxic sediment layers (7 - 18 cm) constitute the main scavengers for metals.

AB  - Dredged materials are now regarded as a source of material for environmental improvement and are being promoted for beneficial uses such as beach, saltmarsh and wetland restoration. Such a variety of end-uses requires more complex risk assessments, particularly with regard to contaminant loadings and their likely fate in sensitive receiving environments. A case study of Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) concentrations in sediments from a large (1.5 x 0.5 km) industrialised dock was used to explore sampling issues and their analysis using geostatistics. A nested sampling scheme of 101 sites was used to identify the magnitude and scale of spatial variation of sediment PCBs. Experimental variograms of individual congeners, total PCBs, particle size, total organic carbon and their principal components are computed and modelled. These provide a clear description of the spatial structure of PCBs and insights into possible processes affecting their distribution. Ordinary kriging was used to estimate PCB concentrations throughout the dock sediments. Two areas in the dock exhibited elevated PCB concentrations, which might reflect particular point sources of contamination. The results confirm the effectiveness of the sampling regime for detecting the spatial scale of variation, and the suitability of geostatistical techniques for accurately describing the spatial distribution of contaminants.

AB  - Estuarine systems are characterized by complex physicochemical and hydrological changes occurring across multiple scales, which determine spatiotemporal variation in distribution and abundance of consumers and their resources. However, little is known about the effects of these biophysical interactions on the interannual dynamics of estuarine food webs. In this work, a five-year stable isotope data set was used to investigate interannual variability in trophic links between basal production sources (seagrass, macroalgae, saltmarsh, particulate organic matter in suspension and in the sediment) and an omnivorous fish (Jenynsia multidentata) in a subtropical estuary emptying in the Southwestern Atlantic. The isotopic variability (C-13, N-15) of basal sources and the consumer was analysed seasonally on a mudflat from 2010 to 2014. Jenynsia multidentata showed significant interannual variation in their trophic links with primary producers. In most seasons and years, the consumer relied heavily on benthic-associated food resources, but shifted to pelagic food resources during certain seasons. A green tide' caused by a massive bloom of vicariant macroalgae occurred on the mudflat, but our findings suggested that the carbon-derived portion of this basal production source was not assimilated by J. multidentata. Instead, seagrass was the most assimilated benthic basal food source in most seasons and years. These results suggest that the intensity of benthic and pelagic trophic pathways sustaining estuarine consumers are not static, but change in response to intra- and interannual variation in the availability of basal production sources. Our findings reinforce the need to account for interannual trends in availability of resources when modelling estuarine food web dynamics.

AB  - Large numbers of people live along and depend upon the world's coastal resources. Human modifications of the coastal zone, in combination with climate induced environmental changes, have had a major effect on the natural ecological systems. GIS analysis of remote sensed data, combined with fieldwork and laboratory tests, can be used to determine the resultant eco-geomorphic changes that need to be managed sustainably on a worldwide scale. Modelling the eco-geomorphic dynamics between 1949 and 2016 on the Wandandian Creek delta (southeastern NSW, Australia) provides a case study of management options for such coastal resources. Results from the Wandandian Creek delta show that sand/silt sediment derived from the partially (22%) modified terrestrial catchment has prograded into the wave-dominated St. Georges Basin where it is impacted by nearshore processes. Clear spatio-temporal growth of the areal extent and elevation of the deltaic levees and sandspits, with their associated mangroves and saltmarshes, has occurred over the past 65 years. Although the growth rate has fluctuated during the study period, due to flood events in 1974, 1990s and 2010, the overall subaerial and subaqueous delta area has had an average growth of 4168 m(2) annually with the shoreline extending 1.451 m/year on average. This geomorphic growth has stabilised the estuarine deltaic habitats with high proportions of nutrients and organic matter, particularly within saltmarsh, mangrove, Casuarina/Juncus and other mixed native plant areas. This research shows the importance of analysing morphological changes observed on the delta that can be related to both anthropogenic modifications and natural processes to the catchment and thus should be used in the development of catchment and coastal management plans.

AB  - Saltmarshes are biogeomorphic ecosystems comprising halophytic plant communities typically located on low energy temperate coasts. Their distribution and structure are controlled by several key drivers, including sediment supply, type of vegetation, elevation, and local hydrodynamics. These dynamic systems are highly vulnerable and estimated to be experiencing annual losses of 1-2% globally. Past restoration efforts have largely implemented managed realignment strategies, however, examples of, and research on, conservation initiatives employing direct transplantation of saltmarsh vegetation into damaged or receding saltmarsh stands is less common. Here an example of transplantation restoration was investigated to understand its influence on sediment dynamics. Sediment settlement, deposition, and accretion rates of natural and restored vegetation (Bolboschoenus maritimus) and adjacent bare mudflats in a small estuary system were studied across consecutive seasons from summer 2015 to spring 2016 to examine the success of transplantation. Natural areas of B. maritimus were shown to be most effective at retaining deposited material, although experiencing the least amount of deposition (an average of 48 g/m(2) per day), accreting by nearly 7.5 mm over the experimental period. Mudflat areas experienced the most deposition (an average of 322 g/m(2) per day) whilst exhibiting the greatest erosion over the study, a decrease in level of 6 mm. Restored areas experience similar rates of deposition as their natural counterparts, however, did not retain this material as efficiently, presenting an erosion of 1.6 mm. The study indicates certain biogeomorphic processes have been altered within the restored area and beginning to reflect those of the natural area. However, the restored vegetation does not yet fully match the functionality of the natural B. maritimus stand, specifically where the natural stand displayed a net accretion of material the restored area did not. Such discrepancies may impact on the continued survival of the restoration site, which may have implications for the potential of transplanting to deliver ecosystem services, such as climate change mitigation through carbon burial.

AB  - The most conventional and abundant tracers of biomass combustion in aerosol particles include potassium and biomarkers derived from thermally altered cellulose/hemicellulose (anhydrosugars) and lignin (methoxyphenols). However, little is known of the role biomass combustion plays as a particulate source of major plant polymers to the atmosphere. Here, concentrations of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols are compared to the yields of polymeric lignin oxidation products (LOPs) during a smoke plume event in Houston, Texas. Downwind aerosol samples (PM2.5) were collected surrounding a two-day wildfire in the McFaddin National Wildlife Refuge, 125 km southeast of Houston, which was 12-16 h directly downwind during the peak of the burn. Concentrations of all organic markers, potassium, and calcium increased by a factor of 2-13 within 1-2 days of the start of the fire and dropped to prefire levels 3 days after the peak event. Source signatures of anhydrosugars and methoxyphenols during the peak of the plume were identical to those of grass charcoals collected from the site, confirming the use of charcoals as end-members for source input reconstruction during atmospheric transport. An enrichment factor of 20 in the anhydrosugar to methoxyphenol ratio of aerosols versus charcoals can be explained partially by differences in degradation rate constants between the biomarker groups. LOPs comprised 73-91% of all lignin material in the aerosols, pointing to fires as major sources of primary biogenic aerosol particles in which lignin phenols occur predominantly in polymeric form.

AB  - Winter temperature and sea-level position are critical factors affecting the global distribution of mangroves and saltmarshes. The replacement of saltmarshes by mangroves is expected due to global warming, reflecting the long-term natural trends in the Holocene and anthropogenic impacts since the 20th century. We documented the Holocene history of wetlands dynamics in the boreal limits of the American mangroves, located at Bay Champagne, Louisiana (USA), by integrating sedimentological, palynological, geochemical (delta C-13 and C\N), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data, and radiocarbon chronology from two sediment cores. The results indicated a freshwater lake environment with herbs and wetland ferns, aswell as C-3 terrestrial plants, between similar to 8100 and similar to 6500 cal yr BP. This environment shifted into a lagoon and saltmarshes having sedimentary organic matter sourced frommarine algae between similar to 6500 and similar to 1500 cal yr BP. In the final stage, washover sediments were deposited in the lagoon during the last similar to 1500 cal yr BP. Despite the increased marine influence over the last similar to 6500 cal yr BP, mangrove pollenwere not recorded between similar to 8100 and similar to 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting that mangroves were absent in the study area during that time interval. Historical evidence and a comparative analysis of ourmulti-proxy datawith othermangrove studies fromthe Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and eastern South America revealed a gradualmangrove expansion from tropical to subtropical coasts of South and North America during the mid-late Holocene. The mangrove colonies at their current boreal (29 degrees 09' N) and austral (28 degrees 29' S) limits were established in the early and mid-20th century, respectively. This mangrove dynamics on a continental scale suggests that the polewardmangrove migrationwas likely caused by the warming climate during the Holocene. More importantly, the industrial-erawarming has likely accelerated themangrove expansion, but it was not the primary force that drove the mangrove migration into temperate zones.

AB  - Metals are concerning pollutants in estuaries, where contamination can undergo significant remobilisation driven by physico-chemical forcing. Environmental concentrations of metals in estuarine sediments are often higher than natural backgrounds, but show no contiguity to potential sources. Thus, better understanding the metal mobility in estuaries is essential to improve identification of pollution sources and their accountability for environmental effects. This study aims to identify the key biogeochemical drivers of metal mobilisation on contaminated estuarine sediments through 91) evaluation of the potential mobilisation under controlled conditions, and 92) investigation of the relevance of metal mobilisation for in situ pollution levels in an area with multiple contaminant sources. Sediments from a saltmarsh adjacent to a coastal landfill, a marina, and a shipyard on the Thames Estuary (Essex, UK) were exposed in the laboratory 924 h, N = 96, 20 degrees C) to water under various salinity, pH, and redox potential. Major cations, Fe(II), and trace metal concentrations were analysed in the leachate and sediment. Salinity, pH and redox had a significant effect on metal mobilisation (p < 0.001), e.g. under certain conditions Fe(II) leaching was increased similar to 1000-fold. Measurements in situ of surface and subsurface sediment cores revealed that landfill proximity poorly explained metal spatial distribution. However, physicochemical parameters explained up to 97% of geochemically normalized metal concentrations in sediments. Organic matter and pH were dominant factors for most of the metal concentrations at the sediment surface. At subsurface, major cations (Ca, Na, Mg and K) were determinant predictors of metal concentrations. Applying the empirical model obtained in the laboratory to geochemical conditions of the studied saltmarsh it was possible to demonstrate that Fe mobilisation regulates the fate of this (and other) metal in that area. Thus, present results highlight the importance of metal mobility to control sediment pollution and estuarine fate of metals. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A good understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of these ecosystems is critical to maximising the benefits from restoration and conservation projects. We mapped mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystem transitions from 1991 to 2015 in south-eastern Australia, using remotely sensed Landsat data and a Random Forest classification. Our classification results were improved by the addition of two physical variables (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), and Distance to Water). We also provide evidence that the addition of post-classification, spatial and temporal, filters improve overall accuracy of coastal wetlands detection by up to 16%. Mangrove and saltmarsh maps produced in this study had an overall User Accuracy of 0.82-0.95 and 0.81-0.87 and an overall Producer Accuracy of 0.71-0.88 and 0.24-0.87 for mangrove and saltmarsh, respectively. We found that mangrove ecosystems in south-eastern Australia have lost an area of 1148 ha (7.6%), whilst saltmarsh experienced an overall increase in coverage of 4157 ha (20.3%) over this 24-year period. The maps developed in this study allow local managers to quantify persistence, gains, and losses of coastal wetlands in south-eastern Australia.

AB  - A creek draining a coastal wetland was studied to determine dissolved iron fluxes to the ocean, and whether these fluxes may be driven by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Dissolved metals (i.e., Fe, Mn, Ba, and U), natural groundwater tracers (Ra-224 and Ra-226), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured every 1 h for 30 h during both summer (wet season) and winter (dry season). The average dissolved Fe concentrations at the mouth of the creek were 8020 and 5630 nM during the summer and winter, respectively. Dissolved Fe concentrations in groundwater were 4060 nM and SGD-derived Fe fluxes were 1.2 mol km(-2) year(-1) (catchment area) or 205 mol km(-2) year(-1) (creek area). Groundwater seepage played a minor role on the total coastal wetland creek export of Fe to the ocean. The surface water dissolved Fe fluxes to the ocean were approximately 9 x 10(5) mol km(-2) (estuary area) year(-1) and similar to 50,000 mol km(2) year(-1) on a catchment area basis. If our results are comparable to other small estuarine systems and considering the global areas of coastal wetlands (similar to 660,000 km(2)), short creeks that drain coastal wetlands may discharge a large amount of dissolved Fe to the ocean (32.2 Gmol year or similar to 1.8 Tg year(-1)) which is comparable to the global river estimates (similar to 1.5 Tg year(-1)). The high dissolved Fe concentrations associated with high DOC concentrations and no significant Fe removal within the estuarine gradient seem to be responsible for these large potential Fe fluxes.

AB  - The retreat of cliffs (lateral expansion) within tidal creeks results in a net loss of saltmarshes, but this retreat process can be retarded by root systems. To understand the interaction between root presence and bank sediment, quantitative measurements of two saltmarsh species root systems (Atriplex portulacoides and Juncus maritima) were carried out in a saltmarsh in Southern England, and their relationships with bank stability were examined. Computed Tomography (CT) Scanning techniques were used to investigate three-dimensional root architecture. The data obtained (e.g., root volume, diameter, and distribution patterns of roots) were examined alongside more traditional root density measurements. The volumetric percentage, ratio between horizontal (lateral) and vertical roots (1-1/V ratio), and root diameter distribution are discussed in relation to their influence on bank sediment erosion threshold and shear strength. The results suggest that Atriplex portulacoides is more effective than Juncus maritimus in stabilising banks. This is because root systems that provide a high resistance to flow-induced erosion are better than those that provide a high resistance to gravity-induced erosion in stabilising cliff banks. This conclusion is relevant to future saltmarsh protection and re-establishment.

AB  - Coastal wetlands provided a favorable settling site for Neolithic people because of their highly exploitable biomass, but were vulnerable to marine hazards such as coastal flooding. The Chinese Hemudu culture persisted for similar to 2000 years (7200-5300 cal. year BP) in the Ningbo coastal lowland of East China. This study explores the Hemudu people's survival strategy using sedimentological and chronological records, and organic and acetic-acid-leachable alkaline-earth (Ca, Sr, and Ba) chemistry on a well-dated profile from the coastal Wuguishan site in the Ningbo Plain. Analyses of alkaline-earth elements in surficial sediments collected from present-day alluvial plain, tidal river, and saltmarsh/tidal flat environments in the Ningbo Plain were also undertaken to explain sedimentary environmental changes and their linkage to Hemudu activity at the Wuguishan site. Results indicate high sediment acetic-acid-leachable Ca and Sr contents with high Sr/Ba ratios, and high sediment total inorganic carbon contents at the site during 6300-6000 cal. year BP, which coincided with a marine incursion at the nearby Neolithic Yushan site. However, the increasing sediment total organic carbon contents and decreasing delta C-13 values suggest that the Wuguishan site evolved from an upper tidal flat to a saltmarsh environment, attracting settlement by the prehistoric Hemudu people after similar to 6200 cal. year BP. Sr and Ca contents and Sr/Ba ratios decreased after similar to 6000 cal. year BP, indicating that the site developed into a low-salinity marsh in the supratidal environment after rapid accumulation caused by a storm event at similar to 6020 cal. year BP. Furthermore, the high Sr and Ba contents in the layers of Hemudu Culture Period III indicate the Hemudu people's consumption of seafood and their adaption strategy for living in the vulnerable coastal wetland.

AB  - Saltmarsh area is decreasing globally from natural and anthropogenic stressors. Accelerating relative sea-level rise (SLR) is projected to exacerbate losses if not offset by upland saltmarsh migration (transgression). In the absence of coastal upland development, saltmarsh transgression rates increase with accelerating SLR and lower upland surface gradients. Storm wind and surge stress coastal upland forests causing defoliation, uprooting, and soil salinization, which makes upland areas more habitable for saltmarsh species and can promote transgression. This study aims to elucidate the contribution of storms to saltmarsh transgression by reconstructing transgression rates over the past 600 years during stormy and non-stormy conditions and fast and slow SLR rates. Our reconstructions are based on the stratigraphic record and historical aerial photography at three sites in North Carolina, U.S.A. where low-gradient pocosin upland grades into expansive saltmarsh. When sea level was rising <0.9 mm yr(-1), saltmarsh transgression rates at the two sites where saltmarsh is > 100 years were an average of 2 and 10 times faster during a paleo-stormy period (1400-1675 CE) than a subsequent non-stormy period. After 1865 CE when SLR accelerated to 2.4 mm yr(-1), transgression rates were an average of 7 times faster than the preceding slow SLR non-stormy period. The two sites where the historical record was not confounded by dredging show transgression was 7 times faster and saltmarsh areas increased an average of 28% during stormy decades than non-stormy decades; however, the rate of transgression only increased at the site with greatest surge during the stormy period characterized by strong northeast winds. Modeled transgression rates, using the paleo-upland slope and a sea level curve, do not match observed transgression rates for the paleo-stormy and rapid SLR periods. Furthermore, the thickness of saltmarsh peat younger than 1957 CE is greater than what would be predicted from independent records of SLR. Changes in the elevation of the upland surface, which is composed of peat, contributes to the disparity between predicted and observed transgression rates. The upland surface elevation can keep pace with some rates of SLR through vertical accretion; however, salinization and decomposition of upland vegetation from storm surge plus SLR decreases the elevation of the paleo-upland surface and increases accommodation and transgression rates. Along low-gradient coastlines with pocosin upland areas, SLR, subsidence, and storminess are coupled in modulating transgression rates and those processes need to be included in forecasts of saltmarsh response to climate change.

AB  - The "MIRACLE" Project was established in order to assess the feasibility of clam farming and high levels of sediment mercury (Hg) contamination coexisting in the Marano and Grado Lagoon, Italy. This lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia). One of the subtasks of the "MIRACLE" Project was to determine the historical evolution of Hg accumulation in the lagoon's bottom sediments. Thirteen 1-m deep sediment cores were collected from the subtidal and intertidal zones, plus one in a saltmarsh, all of which were then analyzed for total Hg content and several physicochemical parameters. Sedimentation rate assessments were performed by measuring short-lived radionuclides (excess Pb-210 and Cs-137). For most of the analyzed cores, natural background levels of Hg were observed at depths of 50-100 cm. In the eastern area, Hg contamination was found to be at its maximum level at the core top (up to 12 mu g g(-1)) as a consequence of the long-term mining activity. The vertical distribution of Hg was related to the influence of the single-point contamination sources, whereas the grain-size variability or organic matter content seemed not to affect it. In the western area. Hg content at the surface was found not to exceed 7 mu g g(-1) and contamination was recorded only in the first 20-30 cm. Geochronological measurements showed that the depositional flux of Hg was influenced by anthropogenic inputs after 1800, when mining activity was more intense. After 1950, Hg in the surface sediment, most remarkable in the central-western sector, seemed to also be affected by the discharge of the Aussa River, which delivers Hg from the chlor-alkali plant. In 1996, Hg mining at Idrija ceased, however the core profiles did not show any subsequent decreasing trend in terms of Hg flux, which implies the system retaining some "memory" of contamination. Thus, in the short term, a decrease in Hg inputs into the nearby Gulf of Trieste and the lagoon seems unlikely. A preliminary rounded-down gross estimate of total Hg "trapped" in the lagoon's sediments amounted to 251 t. Such a quantity, along with the complexity of the lagoon ecosystem, suggests that an in toto reclamation of the sediments at the lagoon scale is unfeasible, both economically and environmentally.

AB  - The ecological role of intertidal microphytobenthos (MPB) is increasingly recognized in coastal production systems. MPB primary production (PP) measured in coastal wetlands of Korea, Cambodia, and Australia confirmed large variability at the global scale. Surprisingly, MPB biomass in mangrove forests almost doubled those measured in nearby bare tidal flats. However, MPB productivity (P-b) in vegetated habitats was significantly reduced (by similar to 50%) compared to that on bare tidal flats. Extensive measurements of MPB biomass, PP, and P-b across 12 Korean tidal flats revealed large spatiotemporal variations, suggesting complex sediment-MPB coupled dynamics. The key factors included sediment type, tide, bed elevation, irradiation, temperature, and vegetation. Winter MPB blooms and the elevated P-b seem to be unique characteristics of the Korean intertidal flats. The present study provides the baseline data of MPB PPs in mudflat, saltmarsh, and mangrove habitats in the highly productive zones of the Western Indo-Pacific Rim.

AB  - Increasing evidence shows that herbivores can facilitate plant growth and maintain the resistance of plant communities to trophic consumption in a variety of ecosystems. However, the positive effects of herbivores on annual saltmarsh plants in coastal ecosystems are relatively understudied. In this study, field investigations and manipulative experiments were conducted to explore whether and how microtopographical modification by the herbivorous crab Helice tientsinensis stimulates the growth of the saltmarsh plant Suaeda salsa. Results showed that, despite grazing on S. salsa, H. tientsinensis can promote density, total biomass, average plant height, average root length, and average biomass through burrowing-generated concave-convex microtopography, which can improve the edaphic environment (decreased soil hardness and salinity, and increased soil moisture content, oxidation-reduction potential, and carbon and nitrogen content), and provide plants more clustered growth opportunities that could facilitate positive intraspecific plant interactions. This study can provide scientific guidance for ecosystem restoration in coastal intertidal saltmarshes.

AB  - Fate and transport of Irgarol 1051 were assessed using a modular estuarine mesocosm containing natural seawater, saltmarsh sediments, marsh grass, shrimp, clams, snails, and naturally derived planktonic and benthic microorganisms. The mesocosms were enclosed in a greenhouse under near ambient conditions, and included a saltwater sump and a simulated tidal flux. The exposure was comprised of four replicate treatments of 0, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 ng/L Irgarol. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used to extract Irgarol and its major metabolite M1 (aka GS26575) from water samples. Sediment samples were extracted using Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) with 100% dichloromethane. Irgarol and M1 were separated and quantified utilizing Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) with ElectroSpray Ionization in Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode. Aqueous concentrations of Irgarol declined rapidly (average 93% loss) over the course of the 35 day experiment while Irgarol was accumulated in the sediments (average mass balance of 75 +/- 5%). Loss of aqueous Irgarol occurred in two distinct phases, a relatively rapid phase up to 96 hours post-dose, and a slower phase following 96 hours. The rate constants of the initial rapid degradation phase (k(1)) for treatments 100 and 1,000 ng/L Irgarol were 2-3 times higher than the rate constants of the subsequent slow degradation phase (k(2)) for these treatments. The average half-life of Irgarol in water was 7 +/- 3 days. The aqueous concentration of Irgarol's metabolite, M1 increased over the course of the experiment. By 35 days post-dose, M1 concentrations in water averaged about 3% of the parent compound. M1 also accumulated in mesocosm sediments (average 16.7 +/- 2.5% of total Irgarol dose). Mass balance calculations showed that by 35 days, Irgarol and M1 amounts in mesocosm water and sediments were close to 100% of the initial Irgarol dose. Average partition coefficient normalized for organic carbon (log K(oc)) calculated for Irgarol was 3.2 +/- 0.1 for 35 days post-dose. Accumulation of Irgarol and M1 in mesocosm sediments may warrant further study to assess toxicity for benthic communities.

AB  - The Chubut River flows from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, and is interrupted by a single dam built at the middle valley. The lower valley is dominated by the aggradation of an alluvial plain induced by a complex of spits that enclosed the inlet in the last 5000 years. The river has reduced its flow because the blocking of the upper basin by terminal moraines during the Upper Pleistocene. At least the last two marine transgressions have flooded this estuary, and contributed to the aggradation during regressions. The area is of particular interest in regard to irrigation channels practiced since the XIX century. Today, the mean monthly flow is less than 10 m(3)/s although peaks of 95 m(3)/s have been recorded in Gaiman in July 2001. The dynamics of the estuary is dominated by waves (wave-dominated estuary) as tidal effects attenuate in less than 5 km. Three vibracores were collected within this floodplain: (a) at Gaiman, an area without any effect of the sea (35 km from the coast); (b) at Trelew, at the former avulsion plain of the river (18 km from the coast); and (c) at Playa Magagna, a saltmarsh located 0.4 km from the beach.
   (a) At the Gaiman core (1.54 m long) fresh-water epiphytic diatoms dominate (Epithemia sorex, Cocconeis placentula, Ulnaria ulna) suggesting the aggradation of an alluvial plain.
   (b) The Trelew core (2.19 m long) was collected from a deltaic plain. It was composed by fine sand with organic matter at the base that evolved into silty layers to the top. Several unconformities and laminae with heavy minerals were detected by their geochemical composition analysed by micro X-ray fluorescence (Itrax XRF core scanner). Fine-sand laminated layers were perfectly detected by their high content in S and Cl. On the other hand, mud layers presented lower content in Mg and Al with increments in Ca and V.
   (c) The core from the marsh area (1.67 m long) was analysed in terms of the diatom evolution in order to detect Holocene sea-level and salinity effects. The sand flats from the bottom of the core were dominated by Nitzchia navicularis (mesohalobous and benthic taxa) and evolved into mixed flats, mudflats and marshes to the top. Sharp contacts have been detected between these facies, with wavy and lenticular bedding characterising the mixed flat deposits. The middle of the sequence is dominated by a coastal marine diatom (Paralia sulcata) while the top was dominated by Pinnularia borealis, an aerophilous and brackish/freshwater taxa.

AB  - The carbon isotope composition of terrestrial plants records valuable ecophysiological and palaeoecological information. However, interspecies variability in C-13/C-12, at both the bulk and compound-specific (CS) level, requires further exploration across a range of ecosystem types. Here, we present bulk and n-alkane delta C-13 values, and n-alkane concentrations, from seven plants (C-3 and C-4) growing in a temperate UK saltmarsh. Inter-and intra-species variation in n-alkane delta C-13 values among C-3 plants ranged from 8%(n-C-31) to 10% (n-C-27) across the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons, exceeding variability in bulk tissue (7%). In contrast, the C-4 monocot showed <2% seasonal shifts in bulk and CS values. As a result of the variability in our CS data, we calculate that n-alkane based C-3/C-4 reconstructions in temperate saltmarshes have a maximum uncertainty of similar to 11%. For dicots and succulents, seasonal bulk and CS delta C-13 trends diverged, while for C-3 and C-4 monocots, bulk and CS values followed similar temporal patterns. Fractionation between bulk and n-alkane carbon isotope values varied from -4 to -10% for C-3 plants, and reached -13% for the C-4 monocot. We explain discrepancies between bulk and n-alkane delta C-13 values by referring to possible interspecies variation in salinity adaptation, which may influence the partitioning of pyruvate, shifting the isotopic composition of lipid biomarkers. These findings open new avenues for empirical studies to further understand the metabolic processes fractionating carbon during the synthesis of n-alkanes, enhancing interpretation of the biomarker signal from the geological record.

AB  - Saltmarshes are tremendously important culturally and ecologically because they can provide abundant nutrient-rich fodder for grazing livestock, with relatively little resource investment. They also perform critical ecological services, including detoxifying water and stabilizing coastlines. For these reasons, methods for investigating the nature and extent of past saltmarsh use have significant potential to provide new insights into patterns in coastal adaptations among past agricultural societies as well as paleoenvimnmental change. Stable nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) analyses of animal bone collagen have been used to investigate ancient saltmarsh use based on the idea that plants growing in saline and/or coastal regions can have higher delta N-15 values. However, interpretation of delta N-15 evidence for saltmarsh use can be challenging because variation in terrestrial nitrogen sources and cycling can result in similarly elevated in delta N-15 values in animals that did not feed in saltmarshes. Ecological studies show that stable carbon (delta C-13) and sulfur (delta S-34) isotope analyses are well suited for investigating saltmarsh use because key species (particularly those in the genus Spartina) that dominate these ecosystems in many areas of the world are C-4 plants capable of incorporating sulfuide-derived, S-34-depleted sulfur. We investigate the utility of delta C-13, delta S-34, and delta N-15 for tracking saltmarsh use in archaeological herbivores (n = 80) from seventeenth-to-eighteenth-century Acadian settlements in Canada, which were renowned for their agricultural use of saltmarsh ecosystems. Results show extreme variation in delta C-13 and delta S-34 consistent with feeding along C-3-to-C-4 and sulfate-to-sulfide-derived sulfur continuums. Significant correlations between delta C-13 and delta S-34 suggests that variation in these isotopic compositions reflects the relative importance of Spartina in past Acadian animal husbandry. These findings indicate that, even in areas where other C-13-eniched food sources are available (e.g., seaweeds, maize), combined delta C-13 and delta S-34 analyses should be able to identify Spartina use in coastal regions. A strong negative correlation was also found between delta S-34 and delta N-15, suggesting that processes driving coastal sulfur and nitrogen cycles in the region are coupled (independently of Spartina consumption) and provide new insights into the mechanism behind N-15 enrichment observed in saltmarsh plants.

AB  - Purpose Previous research conducted in the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea) has shown that this environment has been affected by trace metal contamination, especially by mercury (Hg), from both industrial (the chlor-alkali plant) and mining activities (Idrija mine, Slovenia). Sediment cores were collected from two different saltmarshes of this lagoon environment to evaluate the degree of the anthropogenic enrichments and the geochronology of Hg accumulation.
   Materials and methods Core subsampling was performed by cutting 1-cm thick slices at discrete intervals. Mercury determination was done differently from the other parameters in that the two long cores were subsampled at 1-cm intervals to obtain continuous concentration profiles. Samples were completely decomposed, using a mixture of mineral acids in a closed microwave system before being analysed for trace metal content using ICP-OES. Total Hg content in the solid phase was determined by DMA-80. Cs-137 was measured via gamma spectrometry. Pb-210 activity was measured via alpha-counting of its daughter, Po-210, assuming secular equilibrium between the two isotopes.
   Results and discussion In saltmarsh sediments, Fe, Co, Li, Sc and V show no enrichment at both sites thus suggesting that they are essentially lithogenic elements. Conversely, enrichments are minimal (EF = < 2) for As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn and moderate (EF = 2-5) for Cu and Mn and also for Pb and Zn but only in some levels of the sedimentary sequences. An exception is Hg, as expected due to the long-term input proceeding from the historical mining activity which has especially affected the eastern sector of the lagoon.
   Conclusions The core collected from the saltmarsh in the eastern lagoon (Grado) displays a better time resolution during the last century although the Hg background level has not been reached. Conversely, the core collected in the western sector (Marano) has recorded a longer and more complete history of Hg contamination, from the beginning of the peak of Hg extraction activity at the Idrija mine (1850). Both saltmarshes still receive Hg inputs and the sediment accumulation rates in the upper section appear to have increased over the last 10-20 years (from 0.30 to 0.45 cm year(-1) atMarano and from 0.30 to 0.74 cm year(-1) at Grado). Many of these morphological structures suffer erosive processes thus representing a potential source of contaminants associated with sediments, in particular Hg. Conservation and monitoring of saltmarshes should be taken into consideration also from this environmental point of view.

AB  - Although saltmarshes are thought to enhance the productivity of open estuarine waters, the mechanism by which energy transfer occurs has been debated for decades. One possible mechanism is the transfer of saltmarsh production to estuarine waters by vagile fishes and invertebrates. Monthly estimates of fish standing stock, net fish ingress, and predation were used to develop a biomass budget to estimate annual production of fishes and the relative yield to predatory fish, birds, and direct migration to the estuary. Annual production of saltmarsh fishes was estimated to be 31.0 g m(-2) saltmarsh, which falls within the range of previously reported values for estuarine fish communities. The relative yields were 12 to 20% to piscivorous fishes, 8 to 13% to piscivorous birds, and 18 to 29% to export. Annual export of fish biomass was 5.6 g fish m(-2) saltmarsh, representing about 1 to 2% of saltmarsh primary production. Saltmarsh fishes convert marsh production to high-quality vagile biomass (fishes concentrate energy, protein, and nutrients as body mass) and move this readily useable production to the estuary, providing an efficient link between saltmarshes and estuarine predators.

AB  - Vegetated habitats in estuaries may provide a structural refuge and food supply in the same place, but benefits are also derived where a productive food source and suitable habitat are adjacent to each other. Quantifying these relationships is fundamental to understanding the structural and functional characteristics of estuarine ecosystems and for informing management actions. Effective juvenile habitat (habitat that contributes greater-than-average numbers of recruits to the adult population), recruitment patterns and trophic relationships were studied for Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus plebejus) in the lower Clarence River estuary, New South Wales, between 2014 and 2016. Effective juvenile habitat was identified in both the north arm and main river channel of the estuary, and these areas also supported a higher abundance of juvenile prawns. There was minimal recruitment to the southern channels of the estuary, possibly due to reduced connectivity with the incoming tide arising from a rock wall. Trophic relationships in parts of the lower estuary were evaluated using stable isotopes, and saltmarsh grass (Sporobolus virginicus) was the dominant primary producer supporting juvenile Eastern King Prawn productivity across the area. Mangroves were of minimal importance, and seagrass cover was minimal in the area studied. The patterns observed indicate that nursery function of different areas within the lower estuary is a product of connectivity, recruitment and nutrition derived from primary productivity of vascular plants. Habitats within the lower Clarence River estuary have seen substantial degradation over decadal time scales, and the implications of our findings for targeting future habitat repair are discussed.

AB  - Saltmarsh vegetation, seston and microphytobenthos are all conspicuous components of most temperate estuaries and they potentially contribute to the estuarine food chain. Yet their relative contributions are unclear, as is the significance of saltmarsh losses through natural and human-induced impacts. This study aimed to quantitatively determine the contribution of various types of primary producers to detritus in the Walpole-Nornalup Estuary and Leschenault Inlet, two permanently open estuaries in SW Australia, and, estimate the flow of different types of detritus to higher trophic levels, using carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) stable isotopes as tracers. Results of the mixing model indicated that seston, microphytobenthos and to some extent seagrass and fringing saltmarsh were the main contributors to the detrital pool in both estuaries. However, the relative contribution of different primary producers varied both within and between estuaries. The contribution of saltmarsh was higher at sites close to rivers and dense fringing vegetation, while seston, microphytobenthos and seagrass dominated the detrital material at other sites. Benthic harpacticoid copepods were shown to feed on detritus though they appeared to actively select for different components of the detritus depending on site and estuary. Isotopic signatures of other consumers indicated that fish and invertebrates derived nutrients from MPB and detritus, either directly as food or indirectly through feeding on invertebrates. The overall contribution of saltmarsh to detritus was lower in Leschenault Inlet than in Walpole-Nornalup Estuary, possibly as a result of increased clearing of fringing vegetation around Leschenault Inlet. This pattern was however not reflected in harpacticoid food. Therefore, although losses of fringing saltmarsh around estuaries have the potential to significantly affect estuarine food webs, the significance of such losses will be site- and estuary-dependent.

AB  - We used a combination of natural abundance stable isotopes (NASI) and multiple isotope additions to examine the importance of local and tidally imported basal resources to infauna in a tidal, saltmarsh creek within the Plum Island Estuary, Massachusetts, U.S.A NASI analysis was conducted on primary producers and infauna prior to isotope additions. While algal resources as a group had distinct NASI values compared to Spartina spp. resources, various algal resources [sediment-associated algae (local) and phytoplankton (tidally imported)] had similar NASI leading to low dietary resolution with mixing models. To separate primary producer isotope values, we conducted a large-scale, 42 day N-15-addition to the whole saltmarsh creek, which enriched tidally imported (i.e., phytoplankton) and local algae resources. We also conducted small-scale additions of enriched C-13 to 1-m(2) plots within the creek receiving the N-15 addition to separately label local resources. Enriched N-15 and C-13 were taken up by filamentous algae and associated epiphytic diatoms and benthic microalgae creating distinct isotope values in local algal resources. In addition, changes in N-15-tracer uptake by phytoplankton during the first week of the N-15-addition provided a unique enrichment pattern that was followed through the food web. Both NASIs and isotope additions indicated that Spartina spp. was not an important basal food resource to infauna, lending credence to the notion that saltmarsh food webs don't often rely on macrophyte detritus. Isotope additions indicated that various types of algae, both local and tidally imported, were important to the diets of infauna, including polychaetes, tanaids and harpacticoid copepods. Isotope additions increased diet resolution and revealed less accurate basal resource contributions determined with NASI alone. While many food web studies rely on NASI, we feel that the combination of NASI and isotope additions is needed in systems with similar primary producer values to more accurately determine resource contributions, to increase resolution of dietary contributions and to determine the dietary importance of local basal resources.

AB  - Broad-scale links between productivity of estuarine habitats (such as saltmarsh and mangrove) and the exploited species that rely on them have often been used to build a case for habitat conservation and repair. Stable isotope composition can provide a temporally and spatially integrated measure of trophic connectivity with which to quantify habitat-fishery linkages, allowing primary producers that comprise these habitats to be linked with harvested biomass with relatively few assumptions. We present a novel model that applies this approach to estimate the economic value of fisheries harvest derived from dominant estuarine habitats, in two eastern Australian estuaries. Estimated values of fisheries harvest supported by habitats within the model regions ranged from similar to AUD100,000 y(-1) to similar to AUD7,200,000 y(-1). Saltmarsh in the Clarence River had by far the greatest economic value per-unit-area, with an average estimated Total Economic Output (from fisheries harvest) of AUD25,741 ha(-1) y(-1), whereas mangrove was estimated to be AUD5,297 ha(-1) y(-1). Average Total Economic Output in the Hunter River was AUD2,579 ha(-1) y(-1) and AUD316 ha(-1) y(-1) for saltmarsh and mangrove habitats respectively. Estuarine habitats are key ecological indicators of fisheries productivity, and the framework presented here will be broadly useful in estimating the potential economic impacts associated with changes in these indicators.

AB  - Analyses of stable C and N isotopes were used to examine trophic characteristics of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus in relation to body size (15 to 165 mm carapace width, CW) within saltmarsh habitats of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas. Blue crab trophic position did not change with increasing body size, and all size classes appear to consume primary consumers and primary producers in relatively equal proportions. However, blue crab delta C-13 values increased significantly with increasing body size. As body size increased, blue crabs assimilated greater proportions of carbon ultimately derived from Spartina alterniflora. Individuals of approximately 35 mm CW assimilated carbon almost exclusively derived from C-3 plants and benthic algae, whereas larger individuals (125 mm CW) assimilated similar amounts of carbon derived from benthic algae and S. alterniflora-derived detritus. Given the complex nature of saltmarsh food webs and the omnivorous diet of blue crabs, the observed size-based trends have important management and conservation applications.

AB  - Saltmarshes are coastal plant formations frequently found associated with tropical and subtropical mangroves. Saltmarshes in these regions are subject to a wide array of environmental factors. This vegetation has direct and indirect effects on benthic fauna structure both above and below sediment surface. This study describes the vertical distribution of macrobenthic fauna in Amazon saltmarshes with different sediment characteristics. Four vertical stratified samples (0-10 and 10-20 cm) were collected at two different sites: (1) Furo Grande tidal channel (muddy area) and (2) Ajuruteua beach (sandy area). The saltmarsh area varied between sites, being more dense and taller in the sandy area. A total of 1959 individuals were found, belonging to 35 macrobenthic taxa, of which 23 taxa are exclusive to the muddy area. Macrobenthic fauna community distribution varies among Spartina alterniflora marshes with different sediment characteristics. Higher densities and number of taxa were generally found at near-surface layers (0-10 cm). Furthermore, this vertical distribution occurs differently depending on the site and is more prominent in sandy areas where all fauna is concentrated near the surface. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are important carbon sinks globally, but their ability to store carbon hinges on their nitrogen (N) supply and N uptake dynamics of dominant plant species. In terrestrial ecosystems, uptake of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) through roots can strongly influence N acquisition rates and their responses to environmental factors such as rising atmospheric CO2 and eutrophication. We examined the N-15 uptake kinetics of three dominant plant species in North American coastal wetlands (Spartina patens, C-4 grass; Phragmites australis, C-3 grass; Schoenoplectus americanus, C-3 sedge) under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. We further related our results to the productivity response of these species in two long-term field experiments. S. patens had the greatest uptake rates for NO3- and NH4+ under ambient conditions, suggesting that N uptake kinetics may underlie its strong productivity response to N in the field. Elevated CO2 increased NH4+ and NO3- uptake rates for S. patens, but had negative effects on NO3- uptake rates in P. australis and no effects on S. americanus. We suggest that N uptake kinetics may explain differences in plant community composition in coastal wetlands and that CO2- induced shifts, in combination with N proliferation, could alter ecosystem-scale productivity patterns of saltmarshes globally.

AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill led to the severe contamination of coastal environments in the Gulf of Mexico. A previous study detailed coastal saltmarsh erosion and recovery in a number of oil-impacted and nonimpacted reference sites in Barataria Bay, Louisiana over the first 18 months after the spill. Concentrations of alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at oil-impacted sites significantly decreased over this time period. Here, a combination of DNA, lipid, and isotopic approaches confirm that microbial biodegradation was contributing to the observed petroleum mass loss. Natural abundance C-14 analysis of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) reveals that petroleum-derived carbon was a primary carbon source for microbial communities at impacted sites several months following oil intrusion when the highest concentrations of oil were present. Also at this time, microbial community analysis suggests that community structure of all three domains has shifted with the intrusion of oil. These results suggest that Gulf of Mexico marsh sediments have considerable biodegradation potential and that natural attenuation is playing a role in impacted sites.

AB  - Recently, coastal land reclamation through the use of embankments has increased worldwide, and its impacts on ecosystem processes and functionality have been widely reported. However, the ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling turnover processes following the establishment of coastal embankments remain unknown. For this study, we investigated stocks of various types of N in soils, N storage in plant subsystems, the microbial immobilization and mineralization of N, as well as soil physiochemical properties in embanked and adjacent unembanked Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda salsa, and Phragmites australis saltmarshes in the coastal wetlands of China. Coastal embankments in a S. alterniflora saltmarsh significantly decreased the total plant N storage by 50.24%, concentrations of total soil organic N (SON) by 55.16%, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) by 32.33%, nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N) by 41.23%, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) by 13.38%, and the value of soil net ammonification (RA) by 83.49%. However, in P. australis saltmarshes they significantly increased the total plant N storage by 160.24%, concentrations of SON by 57.28%, NH4-N by 7.89%, NO2-N by 101.76%, NO3-N by 32.05%, and the value of RA by 392.95%. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in N cycling following the establishment of coastal embankments in S. salsa saltmarshes. Significant changes in the organic and inorganic soil N pools of S. alterniflora and P. australis saltmarshes were driven by plant residue inputs, which were significantly affected by decreasing soil salinity in these coastal wetlands. Furthermore, our results indicated that coastal embankments altered the immobilization of soil N and mineralization of microorganisms by influencing the growth and activities of soil microbes, which were primarily associated with changes in soil organic and inorganic N pools following the development of coastal embankments. In summary, alterations in the organic N inputs of plants were initiated by the dramatically decreased soil salinity, which was the main determinant that drove N cycling in the soil subsystems of coastal wetlands subsequent to the establishment of coastal embankments.

AB  - Mangroves, saltmarsh plants and seagrasses grow in coastal areas near the land-ocean interface. Marine scientists normally identify the substratum in which these plants grow as sediments. For half a century, sediments supporting emergent vegetation have been described by pedologists and some ecologists as soils. However, more recently, some pedologists began to suggest that subtidal marine substrata should be "subaqueous soils." This followed a change in the definition of soil in the 2nd (1999) edition of Soil Taxonomy by the US Department of Agriculture. These developments have caused concerns among many coastal marine scientists, and have led to the emergence of serious and important questions which we address in this paper. We conclude that the terms "sediment" and "soil" to describe the substrata in coastal environments vegetated by mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass beds are not mutually exclusive. Coastal marine substrata will still be denoted sediments by most marine scientists. Pedologists should recognize and affirm the appropriateness of this historical convention, while they at the same time for specific purposes can use the term "soil" when justifiable according to the definition. Furthermore, research methodology must be appropriate to the environments under study and recognize the uniqueness of these water saturated and largely anoxic environments. This is critical to avoid flawed and incomparable results and to facilitate better communication among scientists working in the coastal zone. A mutual awareness and appreciation among involved communities will help to avoid confusion and improve the understanding among the marine and soil researchers studying these systems. We hope that these ideas can be adopted by the marine and terrestrial scientific communities and look forward to further cooperation through a continued positive dialogue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The inner part of a tide-dominated estuary is often typified by a tight meander bend, where bedload transport from both upstream by river flows and downstream by flood tidal currents merges to establish a bedload convergence (BLC) with the weakest energy condition in the estuary. Despite the potential significance in evaluating relative importance between tidal and river processes, the morphodynamics of the inner estuary remains relatively unexplored in terms of their response to governing processes. This study, based on satellite imagery and field observation, demonstrates that the inner part of the Sittaung River estuary in Myanmar has evolved via active morphodynamics over various temporal scales ranging from monthly to centennial cycles. Channels, including swatchways and flood barbs, migrate rapidly in response to mutually evasive tidal currents on monthly time scales, leading to an increase in the channel sinuosity. Annually, seasonal river floods accelerate channel migration, causing a tight meander bend. A chute cutoff of the point bar at the tight meander bend occurs during the river floods every 6 to 9 years, triggering substantial down-estuary changes in the position of the main channel, bars, tidal flats, and saltmarshes. Over centennial time scales, the main channel formed a large-scale, tight meander bend with a sinuosity exceeding 5, near the downstream end of the inner estuary, which corresponds to the BLC of the estuary. A chute cutoff of the large-scale tight meander bend during the high river flows resulted in the morphologic changes throughout the fluvial-marine transition zone of the Sittaung River estuary: widening of the main channel and the estuary via accelerated channel migration to accommodate an increase in river flows and tidal prism caused by an increase in the hydraulic gradient due to the shortening of the channel length. The tight meander bend has migrated seaward at centennial time scales, suggesting that the river influence has increased over the time, and the estuary is in the progradational phase to become a sediment-exporting delta. The recurrence of the bend tightening after the chute cutoff, however, indicates that flood-tidal currents drive the morphodynamic evolution of the estuary, and the gradual transition from an estuary to a delta is unlikely. Rapid channel migration with bar growth, frequent cutoff, and subsequent infilling of the abandoned channels over various temporal scales all typify the tide-dominated estuary is charged with high sediment loads imported from both rivers and offshore. Despite the construction of dams and reservoirs that reduced sediment supply into the estuary, other anthropogenic activities such as mining activities and deforestation appear to drive an increase in sediment loads, promoting the morphodynamics of the inner part of the Sittaung River estuary.
