	abstract = {Production of belowground organic matter is critical to sustainability of salt marshes. It plays a role in vertical soil accretion, a process essential for salt marshes to maintain their relative elevation and persist as sea levels rise. This paper examines belowground production and soil carbon of a high-latitude saltmarsh in the St Lawrence Estuary (Québec, Canada), which had been subjected to six years of sheep grazing. In the seventh year, without sheep, organic matter production in grazed and ungrazed sections was assessed by examining harvests of plant litter, end-of-season standing crop, and the roots and rhizomes present in in-growth cores. Excepting salinity, porewater chemistry varied little. The grazed marsh had higher soil carbon density and belowground production, yet lower aboveground biomass. Grazing reduces plant litter and increases solar exposure, soil temperature (at this latitude, soil remained frozen until April) and evapotranspiration, thus raising soil salinity and nitrogen demand, the latter a driver of root production. Grazing may not be detrimental to soil carbon storage. Permitting certain types of grazing on restored salt marshes previously drained for agriculture would provide economic incentive to restore tidal flooding, because the natural carbon sink provided in the recovered marsh would make these lands eligible for carbon payments.},

Simultaneously, soil characteristics and nutrient concentrations were also estimated. There was a significant variation in soil characteristics and nutrient contents spatially (except {pH}) as well as temporally. Nutrient contents in aboveground biomass of S. brachiata were also significantly differed spatially (except C and Cl) as well as temporally. Aboveground biomass of S. brachiata ranged from 2.51 to 6.07 t/ha at maturity and it was positively correlated with soil electrical conductivity and available Na, whereas negatively with soil {pH}. The K/Na ratio in plant was below one, showing tolerance to salinity. The aboveground C fixation values ranged from 0.77 to 1.93 C t/ha at all six sampling sites. This study provides new understandings into nutrient cycling—C fixation potential of highly salt-tolerant halophyte S. brachiata growing on intertidal soils of India. S. brachiata have a potential for amelioration of the salinity due to higher Na bioaccumulation factor.},

	abstract = {Vegetated coastal ecosystems ({VCE}) display a promising potential to act as natural carbon sinks in climate change mitigation. Although growing interest in wetland carbon has intensified the global level carbon stock estimation studies, large knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, particularly in tropical salt marshes in the South and Southeast Asian regions. Therefore, the current study aims to quantify the organic carbon stocks in the salt marsh habitats on the Northwest coast of Sri Lanka and to showcase the relevance of salt marsh carbon in local and regional contexts. Vegetation and soil up to a depth of 50 cm were sampled from four sites representing the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve ({WNR}). Species-specific allometric relationships developed for the major succulent halophytic species indicated a significant positive correlation between dry biomass and plant height. The loss-on-ignition ({LOI}) technique was applied in combination with a carbon conversion factor to calculate the soil organic carbon ({SOC}) content across 4 depth intervals. The study provided an average total organic carbon ({TOC}) storage of 73 ± 14.47 Mg C ha−1 up to a depth of 50 cm, in which the aboveground vegetation accounted for {\textasciitilde}2\% share. Sri Lankan salt marshes hold 2.01 Tg of organic carbon and directly reflect their potential for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions ({NDCs}) under the Paris Agreement. This has been the first comprehensive study on salt marsh blue carbon stocks in Sri Lanka and the findings of this study will strengthen the knowledge base on regional and global saltmarsh carbon stocks and their potential role in climate change mitigation.},

	abstract = {Certain coastal ecosystems such as mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats have been identified as significant natural carbon sinks, through the sequestration and storage of carbon in their biomass and sediments, collectively known as ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems. These ecosystems can often thrive in extreme environments where terrestrial systems otherwise survive at the limit of their existence, such as in arid and desert regions of the globe. To further our understanding of the capability of blue carbon ecosystems to sequester and store carbon in such extreme climates, we measured carbon sediment stocks in 25 sites along the Western Arabian Gulf coast. While seagrass meadows and saltmarsh habitats were widely distributed along the coast, mangrove stands were much reduced as a result of anthropogenic pressures, with 90\% of stands having been lost over the last century. Carbon stocks in 1 m deep surface sediments were similar across all three blue carbon habitats, with comparable stocks for saltmarsh (81 ± 22 Mg Corg ha−1), seagrass (76 ± 20 Mg Corg ha−1) and mangroves (76 ± 23 Mg Corg ha−1). We recorded a 38\% decrease in carbon stocks between mature established mangrove stands (91 Mg Corg ha−1) and recently planted mangroves (56 Mg Corg ha−1). Mangroves also had the lowest carbon stock per total area owing to their very limited spatial coverage along the coast. The largest stock per total area belonged to seagrass beds as a result of their large spatial coverage within the Gulf. We employed 210Pb dating to determine the sediment accretion rates in each ecosystem and found mangrove habitats to be the most efficient carbon sequesters over the past century, with the highest carbon burial rate of the three ecosystems (19 g Corg m−2 yr−1), followed by seagrass (9 g Corg m−2 yr−1) and saltmarshes (8 g Corg m−2 yr−1). In this work, we describe a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks in different blue carbon ecosystems within a single marine environment and across a large geographical area, and discuss our results in a global context for other blue carbon ecosystems in the dry tropics.},

The study specifically aimed to gain some insight into how soil waterlogging (hydroperiod) affects the chemical and biological properties of soils as well as the quality and structure of the soil organic matter ({SOM}). Total contents of selected nutrients, total organic carbon and carbon stable isotope (δ13C) were measured in all soil profiles. The results of these analyses enabled us to define the different origin of the {SOM} by discriminating between terrestrial and aquatic {SOM} sources. The findings also show that accumulation of nutrients and {SOM} is significantly magnified in intertidal systems, in which pedoturbation effects induced by water movements are particularly strong. In addition, {DRIFT} spectra of humic acids revealed the changes in the main functional groups in relation to increased waterlogging, highlighting the lower aromaticity and complexity in subaqueous soils ({SASs}), which is possibly due to the effect of the soil water saturation on the chemical and biological {SOM} transformation processes. Microbial biomass carbon ({MBC}), microbial quotient (Qmic) and the activities of some soil enzymes were measured to estimate soil metabolic activity in the systems and to evaluate how the microbial pool contributes to transforming the {SOM}. In all systems, the enzymatic activities were generally higher in subsurface horizons than in the surface horizon. This unexpected behaviour can be explained by the combined effect of water movement, erosion processes and preservation of {SOM} under anaerobic conditions. This study represents an attempt to investigate and understand the ongoing degradation processes in salt marsh ecosystems. The findings emphasize the strong influence of water flow and erosional processes associated with soil waterlogging on chemical and biological reactions in intertidal and subaqueous systems.},

	abstract = {1. Plant invasion can strongly influence carbon (C) cycling processes, thus it may affect climate change by altering C sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in the invaded ecosystem. Since 1979, the exotic Spartina alterniflora has rapidly expanded in China’s coastal areas, where significant increase in methane ({CH}4) emissions has been documented from post-invaded sites. However, a mechanistic understanding of the structural and functional changes of associated methanogens accompanying this invasion remains elusive. 2. Here we conducted integrated biogeochemical investigations on methanogenic substrates, activity, and diversity to identify implications of S. alterniflora invasion for methanogenesis in coastal wetlands. To do this, we collected and analyzed 0–50 cm soil profiles from an uncolonized tidal flat ({TF}) and salt marshes that S. alterniflora has invaded for 1 year ({SA}-1) and 12 years ({SA}-12) in Jiangsu, China. Methanogenic community composition was characterized by massive parallel sequencing. The rates and pathways of methanogenesis were determined by adding trace concentrations of 13C-labeled substrates to anaerobic incubated samples. 3. Our results revealed that 12-year invasion of S. alterniflora drastically increased {CH}4 production potential by one order of magnitude over that of {TF}. This substantial increase was primarily attributed to methanogenesis from trimethylamine; its rates increased by two orders of magnitude over {TF} whereas those from acetate and H2/{CO}2 increased far less. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was the dominant pathway operating in the {TF}, but methanotrophic pathway contributed most to {CH}4 production in the surface layer of {SA}-1 and upper-most 40-cm layers of {SA}-12. Consistent with these observations, the dominant methanogens shifted from obligate hydrogenotrophic Methanococcales in {TF} to potential methylamine-utilizing Methanosarcinaceae in {SA}-12. Our Mantel analysis indicated that ‘non-competitive’ trimethylamine, derived from cytoplasmic osmolytes of S. alterniflora, was the major driver of this change in methanogenic community composition. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that invasive S. alterniflora plants gradually facilitated the local dominance of methylotrophic Methanosarcinaceae by changing the key type of methanogenic substrate in coastal marshes. Shifts in methanogen communities and enhanced availability of trimethylamine elevated the rates and importance of methylotrophic methanogenesis, thereby markedly increasing {CH}4 production potential and emission rates in this type of ecosystem.},

Scott and annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve and subsequent carbon integration and storage into S. fruticosa and S. patula soils respectively, at 0–5 and 5–20 cm depth. S. fruticosa amounts of aboveground ({aC}), belowground ({bC}) and litter ({lC}) carbon were 2300\%, 350\% and 3000\% higher than S. patula according to the respective plant, root and litter biomass. This dramatic difference was reflected in soil organic carbon ({SOC}) values, much higher in S. fruticosa soil at 0–5 cm depth with 17.07 ± 5.83 g kg−1 than S. patula soil with 5.89 ± 1.68 g kg−1, namely 189\% increase. Similarly, {SOC} increased by 109\% in S. fruticosa soil at 5–20 cm depth. This perennial species can accumulate great amount of decaying debris at surface, which would gradually decompose by microbial activity to increase the soil organic carbon stock. Furthermore, the organic carbon incorporated is of better quality because contains higher fractions of glomalin, a stable organic compound known for its important role in soil aggregate stability. In fact, glomalin related soil protein ({GRSP}) was 292\% and 182\% higher in S. fruticosa than S. patula at the two depths respectively. By contrast, the low amount and nature of decaying debris produced in S. patula are easily mineralized and lesser organic carbon is consequently incorporated into soil. Lower {SOC} and {GRSP} affected the soil aggregate stability ({WSA}) in the 0.25–2 mm and 2–5.6 mm aggregate fractions, considerably more detachable in S. patula soil. Moreover, this soil exhibited the highest mineralization coefficient (Qm) at both depths, 125\% and 175\% higher than S. fruticosa soil respectively, and a major sensitivity to carbon loss. The {PCA} further highlighted the ability of S. fruticosa habitat to act as a carbon sink. Results may be valuable for salt marsh vegetation management addressed to mitigate climate change and increase ecosystem services.},

Soils were sampled at three depths (0–5, 5–20 and 20–40 cm). At 0–5 cm depth, soil organic carbon ({SOC}) was higher in {ART} soil (40.08 g kg−1) with respect to {ELY}, {AME}, {AGR}, {SAL} and {RU} (23.63, 11.45, 5.77, 4.40 and 3.18 g kg−1 respectively). Glomalin ({TGRSP}) in {ART} had the same trend, with 8.88 g kg−1 decreased by 51\%, 77\%, 89\%, 92\% and 94\% in {ELY}, {AME}, {AGR}, {SAL} and {RU} soil respectively, indicating that in {ART} recalcitrant organic carbon may prevail. {ART} and {ELY} soils had higher {SOC} and {GRSP} than {AGR} and {AME} soils at 0–5 and 5–20 cm (on average + 70\% and 57\%) but {SOC} values were similar at 20–40 cm depth and glomalin was even higher in {AGR} and {AME} soils at this depth suggesting migration of stable organic compounds in cultivated soils. The water stable aggregates ({WSA}) analysed in the 0.25–2 mm and 2–5.6 mm fractions was also higher in {ART} and {ELY} soils (≈90\%) at 0–5 and 5–20 cm with respect to the other investigated soils. Higher {WSA} (fraction 0.25–5 mm) was found in {AGR} and {AME} soils at 20–40 cm corroborating that at higher {GRSP} corresponds higher aggregation. Potential carbon loss as C-{CO}2 (Mg ha−1) was evaluated at 0–5 cm depth and was much lower in {ART} soil. Accordingly, C-{CO}2/{SOC} ratio assigned to {ART} soil 1.85\% of {SOC} loss against 8.26\%, 11.64\%, 18.90\%, 20.37\% and 22.72\% of {ELY}, {AME}, {RU}, {SAL} and {AGR} soils respectively, indicating that only {ART} and {ELY} soils may exert clear carbon sequestration ability. The soil under annual Salicornia patula Duval Jouve ({SAL}) showed very low {SOC} (4.40 g kg−1) and the highest carbon loss potential (22.72\%) due to shortage of organic decaying debris at surface. Also, C-{TGRSP} resulted higher in {ELY} and {ART} soils (2.51 and 1.31 Mg ha-1respectively) and C-{TGRSP}/{SOC} ratio demonstrated glomalin carbon enrichment in this order: {ART} {\textgreater} {AME} {\textgreater} {ELY} {\textgreater} {AGR} {\textgreater} {SAL} {\textgreater} {RU}, suggesting that carbon sequestration capacity may be assigned to {ART} and {ELY} soils, major carbon sinks in the Pletera salt-marsh area. Conversely, {RU}, {AGR} and {AME} soils, identified as ancient salt-marsh converted into agropastoral systems or altered for tourism purposes showed worse soil properties and higher sensitivity to carbon destabilization. Statistical treatment of data by factor analysis corroborated the obtained results outlining the importance of {ART} and {ELY} soils in maintaining best soil properties and the highest carbon storage capacity.},

Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon ({OC}) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide-dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid-infrared ({MIR}) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of 2500 sediment samples and provide fine-scale spatial coverage of sediment {OC} stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas had larger {OC} stocks (175–504 Mg/ha) than those in nonriverine settings (44–271 Mg/ha). Variation in {OC} stocks among nonriverine sites was high in comparison with riverine and mixed geomorphic settings, with sites closer to riverine outflow from the east and south of Moreton Bay having higher stocks than those located on the sand islands in the northwest of the bay. Sediment {OC} stocks increased with elevation within nonriverine settings, but not in riverine geomorphic settings. Sediment {OC} stocks did not differ between mangrove and saltmarsh habitats. {OC} stocks did, however, differ between dominant species across the research area and within geomorphic settings. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of the South East Queensland catchments (17,792 ha) are comprised of approximately 4,100,000–5,200,000 Mg of sediment {OC}. Comparatively high variation in {OC} storage between riverine and nonriverine geomorphic settings indicates that the availability of mineral sediments and terrestrial derived {OC} may exert a strong influence over {OC} storage potential across intertidal wetland systems.},

Analysis of sediment grain size, porosity, proportion of aggregated particles, total carbonate content and organic geochemical characteristics (total {OM} content, atomic {TOC}/{TN} ratio, δ13C value) of surface sediments allowed identifying four biosedimentary facies: sand flat, mud flat, low and high salt marshes. In parallel, the elemental and isotopic characterization of the suspended particulate {OM} inputs by the rivers, the surface biofilms and the halophytic vegetation was performed to trace the three major sources contributing to sedimentary {OM} in both estuaries. Spatial distribution of {OM} in surface sediments (ranging between 0.6 and 26.9\% dry weight) evidenced higher contents along marsh platforms than in sand and mud flats. and the {OM} pool was mainly constituted of a mixing of C3 terrestrial vascular plants, marine and riverine phytoplankton. The comparison between both estuaries highlighted that the geomorphology impacted by natural and anthropic factors plays a preponderant role in the distribution and the sources of sedimentary {OM} by influencing vegetation communities and hydrodynamic processes. In the context of sea level rise, an improved understanding of the {OM} dynamics within each biosedimentary facies is crucial to better constrain and assess the role of macrotidal estuaries in carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Although empirical studies show that invasive Spartina alterniflora Loisel. (S. alterniflora) has reduced soil bulk density ({BD}), the mechanisms that underpin this response are still unclear. To explore this pattern, we used a space-for-time substitution approach and collected soil samples from the eastern coast of China, where S. alterniflora ecosystems were established a short period of time after initial invasion. We used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesis that S. alterniflora invasion has an indirect influence on {BD} through the interacting effects of soil and plant variables, including plant productivity, soil organic carbon ({SOC}), total nitrogen ({TN}), {pH}, salinity, sand, and clay content. These variables, which are associated with S. alterniflora invasion, were assumed to represent multiple physicochemical and biological processes. The model showed that these processes explain 82\% of the {BD} variation in response to S. alterniflora invasion. We observed that {SOC} had the most direct influence on {BD}, followed by salinity and soil sand content. We also found that S. alterniflora invasion had an important direct influence on the measured variables. Although plant productivity was not directly related to {BD}, it was indirectly associated with the impacts of plant productivity on salinity. Our results highlight the occurrence of {BD} variability within an interacting system of soil and plants wherein S. alterniflora invasion leads to a decrease in {BD}. This work also highlights that identifying the mechanisms driving {BD} variability in response to S. alterniflora invasion would help to improve our understanding of soil development in S. alterniflora marshes.},

This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia ({BC}), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 ± 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 ± 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 ± 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates ({CARs}) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m2/yr (median 70.1 g C/m2/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45\% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20\% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study’s quantification of carbon stocks and {CARs} is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment. We outline subsequent research needed for salt marshes such as Boundary Bay to be included in voluntary carbon markets in British Columbia.},

The Lena River Delta, which is the largest delta in the Arctic, extends over an area of 32 000 km2 and likely holds more than half of the entire soil organic carbon ({SOC}) mass stored in the seven major deltas in the northern permafrost regions. The geomorphic units of the Lena River Delta which were formed by true deltaic sedimentation processes are a Holocene river terrace and the active floodplains. Their mean {SOC} stocks for the upper 1 m of soils were estimated at 29 kg m−2 \&amp;pm; 10 kg m−2 and at 14 kg m−2 ± 7 kg m−2, respectively. For the depth of 1 m, the total {SOC} pool of the Holocene river terrace was estimated at 121 Tg ± 43 Tg, and the {SOC} pool of the active floodplains was estimated at 120 Tg ± 66 Tg. The mass of {SOC} stored within the observed seasonally thawed active layer was estimated at about 127 Tg assuming an average maximum active layer depth of 50 cm. The {SOC} mass which is stored in the perennially frozen ground at the increment 50–100 cm soil depth, which is currently excluded from intense biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere, was estimated at 113 Tg. The mean nitrogen (N) stocks for the upper 1 m of soils were estimated at 1.2 kg m−2 ± 0.4 kg m−2 for the Holocene river terrace and at 0.9 kg m−2 ± 0.4 kg m−2 for the active floodplain levels, respectively. For the depth of 1 m, the total N pool of the river terrace was estimated at 4.8 Tg ± 1.5 Tg, and the total N pool of the floodplains was estimated at 7.7 Tg ± 3.6 Tg. Considering the projections for deepening of the seasonally thawed active layer up to 120 cm in the Lena River Delta region within the 21st century, these large carbon and nitrogen stocks could become increasingly available for decomposition and mineralization processes.},
