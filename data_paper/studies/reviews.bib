	abstract = {Despite escalating anthropogenic alteration of food webs, how the carbon cycle in ecosystems is regulated by food web processes remains poorly understood. We quantitatively synthesize the effects of consumers (herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) on the carbon cycle of coastal wetland ecosystems, ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems that store the greatest amount of carbon per unit area among all ecosystems. Our results reveal that consumers strongly affect many processes of the carbon cycle. Herbivores, for example, generally reduce carbon absorption and carbon stocks (e.g. aboveground plant carbon by 53\% and aboveground net primary production by 23\%) but may promote some carbon emission processes (e.g. litter decomposition by 32\%). The average strengths of these effects are comparable with, or even times higher than, changes driven by temperature, precipitation, nitrogen input, {CO}2 concentration, and plant invasions. Furthermore, consumer effects appear to be stronger on aboveground than belowground carbon processes and vary markedly with trophic level, body size, thermal regulation strategy and feeding type. Despite important knowledge gaps, our results highlight the powerful impacts of consumers on the carbon cycle and call for the incorporation of consumer control into Earth system models that predict anthropogenic climate change and into management strategies of Earth's carbon stocks.

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands play an increasingly important role in regulating greenhouse gas ({GHG}) fluxes and thus affecting climate change. However, the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of {GHG} fluxes in these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify patterns and drivers of {GHG} fluxes across coastal wetlands in China. Average methane ({CH}4), nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were estimated as 2.20±0.31 mg·m-2·h-1, 16.44±2.96 μg·m-2·h-1, and 388.76±42.28 mg·m-2·h-1, respectively. {GHG} emissions varied with tidal inundation, where {CH}4 and {CO}2 emissions during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. {CH}4 and {CO}2 emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude, while N2O did not. {CH}4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature and aboveground biomass, and {CO}2 emissions were positively related to soil organic carbon. N2O fluxes were lower with increasing soil {pH}, and {CH}4 and {CO}2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that the fluxes of {CH}4 and N2O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback to global warming, which is mainly driven by the {CH}4 emission. Our synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field observations of {GHG} fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in {GHG} fluxes and the assessment of net {GHG} balance and its contribution to the {GWP} of coastal wetlands.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions resulting from anthropogenic activities are one of the greatest threats to maintaining ecosystem functioning and native biodiversity. Invasions are especially problematic when the invading species behaves as an ecosystem engineer that is capable of transforming ecosystem structure, function, and community dynamics. Of particular concern is the spread of emergent wetland grasses whose root systems alter hydrology and structural stability of soils, modify ecosystem functions, and change community dynamics and species richness. To address the threats posed to ecosystems across the globe, management practices focus on the control and removal of invasive grasses. However, it remains unclear how severely invasive grasses alter ecosystem functions and whether alterations persist after invasive grass removal, limiting our ability to determine if management practices are truly sufficient to fully restore ecosystems. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify ecological alterations and the efficacy of management following the invasion of Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis, two common and pervasive invaders in coastal wetlands. Our results indicate that S. alterniflora and P. australis significantly alter measures of ecosystem functioning and organismal abundance. Invaded ecosystems had significant elevations in abiotic carbon and nitrogen fixation and uptake in areas with invasive grasses, with differential photosynthetic pathways of these two grass species further explaining carbon fluxes. Moreover, evidence from our analyses indicates that management practices may not adequately promote recovery from invasion, but more data are needed to fully assess management efficacy. We call for future studies to conduct pairwise comparisons between uninvaded, invaded, and managed systems and provide research priorities.},

	abstract = {Global vegetated coastal habitats ({VCHs}) represent a large sink for organic carbon ({OC}) stored within their soils. The regional patterns and causes of spatial variation, however, remain uncertain. The sparsity and regional bias of studies on soil {OC} stocks from Chinese {VCHs} have limited the reliable estimation of their capacity as regional and global {OC} sinks. Here, we use field and published data from 262 sampled soil cores and 181 surface soils to report estimates of soil {OC} stocks, burial rates and losses of {VCHs} in China. We find that Chinese mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats have relatively low {OC} stocks, storing 6.3 ± 0.6, 7.5 ± 0.6, and 1.6 ± 0.6 Tg C (±95\% confidence interval) in the top meter of the soil profile with burial rates of 44 ± 17, 159 ± 57, and 6 ± 45 Gg C/year, respectively. The variability in the soil {OC} stocks is linked to biogeographic factors but is mostly impacted by sedimentary processes and anthropic activities. All habitats have experienced significant losses, resulting in estimated emissions of 94.2–395.4 Tg {CO}2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) over the past 70 years. Reversing this trend through conservation and restoration measures has, therefore, great potential in contributing to the mitigation of climate change while providing additional benefits. This assessment, on a national scale from highly sedimentary environments under intensive anthropogenic pressures, provides important insights into blue carbon sink mechanism and sequestration capacities, thus contributing to the synchronous progression of global blue carbon management.},

	abstract = {Vegetated coastal ecosystems (mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes, often called Blue Carbon ecosystems) store large carbon stocks. However, their regional carbon inventories, sequestration rates, and potential as natural climate change mitigation strategies are poorly constrained. Here, we systematically review organic carbon storage and accumulation rates in vegetated coastal ecosystems across the Central and Southwestern Atlantic, extending from Guyana (08.28°N) to Argentina (55.14°S). We estimate that 0.4 Pg organic carbon is stored in the region, which is approximately 2-5\% of global carbon stores in coastal vegetated systems, and that they accumulate 0.5 to 3.9 Tg carbon annually. By ecosystem type, mangroves have the largest areal extent and contribute 70-80\% of annual organic carbon accumulation, with Brazil hosting roughly 95\% of mangrove stocks. Our findings suggest that organic carbon accumulation in the region is equivalent to 0.7 to 13\% of global rates in vegetated coastal ecosystems, indicating the importance of conserving these ecosystems as a nature-based approach for mitigating and adapting to climate change.},
