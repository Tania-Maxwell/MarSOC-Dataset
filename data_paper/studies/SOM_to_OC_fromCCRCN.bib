	abstract = {Tidal marshes have been recognized globally for their ability to sequester “blue carbon” but there is still a need for studies investigating the marsh response to restoration, particularly in the Pacific Northwest United States. Here we report carbon stocks and accumulation rates for restored and natural tidal marshes in the Stillaguamish River estuary in Puget Sound, Washington, where a 60-hectare marsh was reintroduced to the tidal regime from its previous use as diked and drained farmland. We found that the restoration not only maximized carbon accumulation but also enhanced resilience to rising sea levels. Four years after restoration, mean sediment carbon stocks in the upper 30 cm within the restored marsh (4.43 kg C m
              -2
              ) were slightly lower than those measured in the adjacent natural marshes (5.95 kg C m

              Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including the ability to sequester and store carbon. Recent initiatives, such as the U.S. Climate Alliance’s National Working Lands Challenge, have sought to better understand and quantify this ‘blue carbon’ storage as a land management approach to maintain, or potentially offset, atmospheric carbon emissions. To build on this effort locally, loss on ignition and elemental analyses were used to assess sediment organic matter, dry bulk density, and carbon density variability within the root zone of a mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh in Delaware. Additionally, we assessed sediment carbon variability at depth greater than one meter and quantified the black carbon fraction in the mesohaline tidal marsh. Organic matter concentrations ranged between 11.85 ± 1.19\% and 23.12 ± 6.15\% and sediment carbon density ranged from 0.03 ± 0.01 g cm
              −3
              to 0.06 ± 0.02 g cm
              −3
              with both found to significantly differ between the mesohaline and oligohaline tidal marsh systems. Significant differences between dominant vegetation types were also found. We used these data to further estimate and valuate the carbon stock at the mesohaline tidal marsh to be 350 ± 310 metric tons of soil carbon accumulation per year with a social carbon value of \$40,000 ± \$35,000. This work improves our knowledge of Delaware-specific carbon stocks, and it may further facilitate broad estimates of carbon storage in under-sampled areas, and thereby enable better quantification of economic and natural benefits of tidal wetland systems by land managers.},

This dataset contains results from 3 cores collected in 2018 from different habitat types in the wetland: mudflat ({ELM}1812-{MFA}1) cordgrass-dominated ({ELM}1812-{SPA}2), and pickleweed-dominated ({ELM}1812-{PWA}1). The data include bulk density, total organic matter (\%{TOM}), organic carbon (\%{OC}), nitrogen (\%N), and sediment grain size (\%Sand, \%Silt, and \%Clay). Sediment ages were determined from 210Pb data, modeled using the {PLUM} approach with the modeled ages verified using 137Cs data. All data was measured in 1-cm intervals for the full depth of each core, with core depths ranging from 30-35 cm.},
