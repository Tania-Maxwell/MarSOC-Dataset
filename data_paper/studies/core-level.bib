Assessing carbon stocks, carbon sources, and the transfer of carbon between habitats within coastal seascapes are each integral in identifying the role of blue carbon habitats in coastal carbon cycling. Here, we quantified carbon stocks, sources, and exchanges in seagrass meadows, salt marshes, and unvegetated sediments in six bays along the California coast. In the top 20 cm of sediment, the salt marshes contained approximately twice as much {OC} as seagrass meadows did, 4.92 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.36 kg {OC} m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} compared to 2.20 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±{\textless}/span{\textgreater} 0.24 kg {OC} m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, respectively. Both salt marsh and seagrass sediment carbon stocks were higher than previous estimates from this region but lower than global and {US}-wide averages, respectively. Seagrass-derived carbon was deposited annually into adjacent marshes during fall seagrass senescence. However, isotope mixing models estimate that negligible amounts of this seagrass material were ultimately buried in underlying sediment.

	abstract = {Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and “reclaimed” for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canada’s Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.},

Terrestrial {OM} was highest at the upper marshes and decreased closer to the sea, and the distribution of sedimentary total organic carbon ({TOC}) was influenced mostly by particle size. Terrestrial {OM} with a C3 signature was the predominant source of sedimentary {OM} in the Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh system. This means that aside from contributions from the local marsh plants, the Andong salt marsh received input mostly from the Qiantang River and the Changjiang Estuary. Transect C, which was situated nearer to the Qiantang River mouth, was most likely influenced by input from the Qiantang River. Likewise, a nearby creek could be transporting materials from Hangzhou Bay into Transect A (farther east than Transect C), as Transect A showed a signal resembling that of the Changjiang Estuary. The predominance of terrestrial {OM} in the Andong salt marsh despite overall reductions in sedimentary and terrestrial {OM} input from the rivers is most likely due to increased contributions of sedimentary and terrestrial {OM} from erosion. This study shows that lower salt marsh accretion due to the presence of reservoirs upstream may be counterbalanced by increased erosion from the surrounding coastal areas.},

	abstract = {Coastal vegetated ecosystems such as saltmarshes and seagrasses are important sinks of organic carbon ({OC}) and total nitrogen ({TN}), with large global and local variability, driven by the confluence of many physical and ecological factors. Here we show that sedimentary {OC} and {TN} stocks of intertidal saltmarsh (Sporobolus maritimus) and seagrass (Zostera noltei) habitats increased between two- and fourfold along a decreasing flow velocity gradient in Ria Formosa lagoon (south Portugal). A similar twofold increase was also observed for {OC} and {TN} burial rates of S. maritimus and of almost one order of magnitude for Z. noltei. Stable isotope mixing models identify allochthonous particulate organic matter as the main source to the sedimentary pools in both habitats (39–68\%). This is the second estimate of {OC} stocks and the first of {OC} burial rates in Z. noltei, a small, fast-growing species that is widely distributed in Europe (41,000 ha) and which area is presently expanding (8600 ha in 2000s). Its wide range of {OC} stocks (29–99 Mg ha−1) and burial rates (15–122 g m2 y−1) observed in Ria Formosa highlight the importance of investigating the drivers of such variability to develop global blue carbon models. The {TN} stocks (7–11 Mg ha−1) and burial rates (2–4 g m−2 y−1) of Z. noltei were generally higher than seagrasses elsewhere. The {OC} and {TN} stocks (29–101 and 3–11 Mg ha−1, respectively) and burial rates (19–39 and 3–5 g m−2 y−1) in S. maritimus saltmarshes are generally lower than those located in estuaries subjected to larger accumulation of terrestrial organic matter.},

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary {OC} and {TN} within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter ({OM}) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and {OC} and {TN} stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. {OC} and {TN} stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that {OM} sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17–32\%) and decreasing contributions of {POM} (45–35\%). As well, {OM} sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48\%), but not {POM} (39\%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands can have exceptionally large carbon (C) stocks and their protection and restoration would constitute an effective mitigation strategy to climate change. Inclusion of coastal ecosystems in mitigation strategies requires quantification of carbon stocks in order to calculate emissions or sequestration through time. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stocks of coastal wetlands of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve ({SKBR}) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We stratified the {SKBR} into different vegetation types (tall, medium and dwarf mangroves, and marshes), and examined relationships of environmental variables with C stocks. At nine sites within {SKBR}, we quantified ecosystem C stocks through measurement of above and belowground biomass, downed wood, and soil C. Additionally, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the soil and interstitial salinity. Tall mangroves had the highest C stocks (987±338 Mg ha−1) followed by medium mangroves (623±41 Mg ha−1), dwarf mangroves (381±52 Mg ha−1) and marshes (177±73 Mg ha−1). At all sites, soil C comprised the majority of the ecosystem C stocks (78–99\%). Highest C stocks were measured in soils that were relatively low in salinity, high in P and low in N∶P, suggesting that P limits C sequestration and accumulation potential. In this karstic area, coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, are important C stocks. At the landscape scale, the coastal wetlands of Sian Ka'an covering ≈172,176 ha may store 43.2 to 58.0 million Mg of C.},

Here, we compared ecosystem C stocks (trees, soil and downed wood) and soil N stocks of different types of riverine wetlands (marsh, peat swamp forest and mangroves) whose distribution spans from an environment dominated by river forces to an estuarine environment dominated by coastal processes. We also estimated soil C sequestration rates of mangroves on the basis of soil C accumulation. We predicted that C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps would be larger than marshes, and that C, N stocks and C sequestration rates would be larger in the upper compared to the lower estuary. Mean C stocks in mangroves and peat swamps (784.5 ± 73.5 and 722.2 ± 63.6 {MgC} ha$^{\textrm{−1}}$, respectively) were higher than those of marshes (336.5 ± 38.3 {MgC} ha$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$). Soil C and N stocks of mangroves were highest in the upper estuary and decreased towards the lower estuary. C stock variability within mangroves was much lower in the upper estuary (range 744–912 {MgC} ha$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) compared to the intermediate and lower estuary (range 537–1115 {MgC} ha$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$) probably as a result of a highly dynamic coastline. Soil C sequestration values were 1.3 ± 0.2 {MgC} ha$^{\textrm{−1}}$ yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and were similar across sites. Estimations of C stocks within large areas need to include spatial variability related to vegetation composition and geomorphological setting to accurately reflect variability within riverine wetlands.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, we sampled five Melaleuca wetlands and measured their C and N ecosystem stocks (aboveground biomass and soil), tree accumulation rates, sedimentation rates, and soil stability. Melaleuca wetlands were highly heterogeneous, but most have large ecosystem C [mean ± {SE} (range); 360 ± 100 (80–670) Mg C ha−1] and N [8100 ± 1900 (1600–13,000) kg N ha−1] stocks.

We found evidence of long-term C and N accumulation in the soil, but also of some level of organic decomposition. Overall, we found that Melaleuca wetlands store and accumulate large amounts of C, especially in their trees, and large amounts of N in their soils, suggesting an important role in coastal biogeochemical cycles.},

They can survive extreme conditions of low precipitation, high solar radiation, wide temperature fluctuations and hypersalinity. These unique mangroves have distinct geomorphology, hydrology, forest structure, tree physiology, and soil biogeochemistry. In this review, supported by field data from Australia and Mexico, we explore the characteristics of mangroves in arid climates of the world. These mangroves are mostly tide-dominated with freshwater flows restricted to groundwater and sporadic tropical storms. They form dense forests with stunted growth dominated mainly by trees of the genus Avicennia that co-occur with salt marshes in the high intertidal. Their soils have low nutrient and carbon concentrations, and high soil δ15 N and δ13C values compared to subhumid and humid mangroves. Mangroves in arid climates have relatively low human pressure due to sparse human settlements. Key threats to these mangroves, which often persist at the edge of their physiological tolerances, include extreme drought, reductions in groundwater inputs, altered hydrology, sea-level fluctuations and increases in nutrient loading. Restoration of mangroves in arid climates should focus on restoring their hydrology. Mangroves in arid zones are under-represented in global maps and assessment programs, as they may not be consistent with countries’ definition of “forests”. Improved global representation and understanding of the ecology of mangroves in arid climates could help sustain their valuable ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Tidal coastal wetlands, common home to seagrass and salt marshes, are relevant carbon sinks due to their high capacity to accumulate and store organic carbon in their sediments. Recent studies demonstrated that the spatial variability of this organic carbon within the same wetland system can be significant. Some of the environmental drivers of this spatial variability remain understudied and the selection of the most relevant ones can be context dependent. Here we investigated the role of bed elevation, hydrodynamics, and habitat type (salt marsh and seagrass) on the organic matter ({OM}) net deposition-resuspension rate and superficial sedimentary stocks (top 5 cm) at the tidal wetlands of the Ria Formosa, a mesotidal coastal lagoon in South Portugal. Results showed that two vectors of spatial variation need to be considered to describe the intertidal sedimentary {OM} stocks: the bed elevation that imposes a decrease of the hydroperiod and thus the change of habitat from the lower seagrass Z. noltei to the upper saltmarsh S. maritimus, and the horizontal spatial variation along the secondary channels of the lagoon that imposes a decrease in the current flow velocity magnitude. The multiple linear regression analyses, using data from 40 sampling points, explained 59\% of the variation of the superficial sedimentary stocks of {OM} in salt marshes and seagrasses of the Ria Formosa lagoon and revealed that stocks generally decrease with elevation, yet with variation among sites and habitats. It was also found that the decrease of the {OM} net deposition-resuspension rate with bed elevation was exponential. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering multiple environmental drivers and spatial variation for regional estimations of organic matter (and organic carbon) sedimentary stocks in coastal wetlands.},

	abstract = {With the increasing need to accurately quantify carbon sinks of coastal wetlands, this study compares three methods in use. Sediment cores (n = 4) were collected from three salt marsh sites of the Rubicon Estuary, Tasmania Australia and analysed for organic carbon using three methods for measuring soil C concentration. The first method of elemental analysis quantified carbon using a Thermo Finnigan {EA} 1112 Series Flash Elemental Analyser. The second method used the loss on ignition technique at 550°C for 4 hours and applied a standard carbon conversion. The third method used loss on ignition technique at 450°C for 8 hours and applied a standard carbon conversion. Results from each method found significantly different quantities of carbon in replicate samples, however each method differentiated similar carbon trends within datasets. Each methodology investigated was found to have a useful application in carbon science, including the broad scale use of the standard carbon conversion and the accuracy of the elemental analysis method. The application of the standard carbon conversion in this study showed an underestimate of carbon stores in salt marsh sediment. Wetlands are well known to be among the most carbon rich ecosystems of the world, however this study highlights that in some cases those carbon stores may have been underestimated, and verification may further increase the value of wetlands as carbon sinks.},

	abstract = {Blue carbon ecosystems (including saltmarsh, mangrove, seagrass meadows, and other soft sediment habitats) play a valuable role in aquatic carbon dynamics and contribute significantly to global climate change mitigation. However, these habitats are undergoing rapid and accelerating shifts in extent due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we demonstrate that blue carbon stocks vary across habitats and that cross-habitat subsidies of carbon contribute significantly to blue carbon stocks. Using a case study estuary from New Zealand, organic carbon stocks in above ground biomass and sediment to 100 cm varied significantly between habitat types, from saltmarsh (90 t ha–1), to mangrove (46 t ha–1), to seagrass (27 t ha–1) and unvegetated habitats (26 t ha–1). Despite being typically overlooked in blue carbon literature, unvegetated habitats contained the majority of estuarine carbon stocks when adjusted for their large extent within the estuary (occupying 68.4\% of the estuarine area and containing 57\% of carbon stocks). When carbon stocks were further refined based on δ13C and δ15N mixing model results, coastal vegetation (saltmarsh, mangrove, and seagrass) was found to provide important cross-habitat subsidies of carbon throughout the estuary, including contributing an estimated 41\% of organic carbon within unvegetated sediments, and 51\% of the total carbon stock throughout the estuary (yet occupying only 31.6\% of the estuary). Given the connected nature of blue carbon ecosystems these findings illustrate the importance of considering the contribution and cross-habitat subsidies of both vegetated and unvegetated habitats to blue carbon stocks in estuaries. This provides critical context when assessing the impact of shifts in habitat distributions due to impacts from climate change and anthropogenic stressors.},

Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 ± 78, 830 ± 109, and 723 ± 100 Mg C ha-1, respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha-1) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 ± 118,635 tons of {CO}2 equivalent ({CO}2e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the {CO}2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.},

The objective of this study was to determine to what extent salt marsh plant ecology and, specifically, vegetation composition and zonation relate to this underlying substrate of organic matter (peat). A vegetation survey was carried out on nine salt marshes, three on peat substrate and two on sand, mud and sand/mud, respectively. In parallel, key edaphic variables were measured including {pH}, conductivity, organic content, moisture content and nutrients: ammonium, nitrate and phosphorus. Salt marshes on peat substrate are distinct. Ammonium content was twice the maximum reported in other salt marsh studies, while the vegetation composition of salt marshes on peat substrate was significantly different from that of other salt marshes. Salt marshes on peat substrate were found to be higher in species diversity and richness and characterised by a predominantly forb and rush community. However, some common salt marsh species, such as Atriplex portulacoides and Spartina anglica were absent from salt marshes on peat. Ordination analysis revealed that zonation was primarily associated with conductivity on peat substrates. In contrast, moisture plays a greater role in zonation within non-peat salt marshes. The findings confirm that the high organic matter content of ombrogenic Atlantic salt marshes is associated with distinct vegetation composition.},

	abstract = {In this study we quantified the different forms of nitrogen, organic carbon and phosphorus in two eutrophicated watercourses flowing into a coastal salt marsh of the Mar Menor lagoon and analysed the role of the water flow regime in the nutrient loads flowing into the salt marsh. We discuss the degree to which the soil–plant system in stands of Phragmites australis could be affected by the discharges of nutrients and estimate the stocks of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon in different compartments of the system. The base flow sustained an important discharge of surplus water of agricultural origin enriched in dissolved organic carbon (12.7Ty−1) and nitrogen (78.3Ty−1, 85 \% N–{NO}3− and 15\% organic–N) into the salt marsh, while inputs from wastewater-treatment plants were of much lower magnitude (5.5Ty−1 of dissolved organic carbon and 4.1Ty−1 of nitrogen, 57 \% N–{NH}4+ and 43\% organic–N). The annual loads of phosphorus of agricultural origin and from urban wastewater were 1.87Ty−1 and 0.97Ty−1, respectively. The data show that the high amounts of inorganic nitrogen from agricultural activity are absorbed by vegetation or denitrified, while organic nitrogen probably helps to compensate for soil nitrogen lost by mineralisation. The soils of the salt marsh may be considered a sink for phosphorus flowing into it in wastewater. The tissues of P. australis showed differing patterns of accumulation and translocation of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus; the concentrations of these three elements changed with the season but apparently were not affected by the eutrophicated water that the plants received. Soil salinity, {pH}, Fe concentrations and phosphorus content had little influence on litter quality. Dry stems were important reservoirs of organic carbon since they persisted throughout the year, while dry leaves were the main contributors to the litter, which was mineralised partially during spring and summer. Calculations of primary productivity showed a positive balance of carbon in the below-ground biomass (595gm−2y−1), above-ground (2610gm−2y−1) and litter (260gm−2y−1). The average soil organic carbon concentration decreased in one of the plots studied, probably because mineralisation was favoured since the soil was dry most of the time. Hence, our data suggest that although the high biomass production of Phragmites favours carbon sequestration in plant biomass, soil organic carbon losses in stands of this species may be very important throughout the year.},

	abstract = {The installation of desalination plants close to ecosystems of interest may have environmental impacts that make corrective measures necessary. Especially, wetlands (which are water-dependent ecosystems) are prone to degradation. This is the case for the Agua Amarga salt marsh ({SE} Spain), that includes an abandoned solar saltworks and surrounding, topographically higher zones, in which the groundwater withdrawal to supply two desalination plants has led to a drop of the piezometric levels and the desiccation of the ecosystem. To overcome these problems, a programme to irrigate the marsh with seawater was established. This paper reports some soil characteristics of the marsh in relation to the different types of vegetation/environment identified and the seawater irrigation programme, with the objective being to propose some guidelines to improve the management of the site. Surface and subsurface samples were taken from 63 plots and the depth of the water level and the soil redox potential (Eh), moisture, electrical conductivity ({EC}), {CaCO}3, organic carbon, nitrogen and bulk density were determined. Also, the soil texture, structure, consistence, accumulation of salt crystals and redoximorphic features – indicative of reduction-oxidation processes – were described. The poor structure (weak, granular, subangular and angular blocks, very fine and fine) showed that the soils were hardly developed. The periphery (mainly colonised by Suaeda vera, Lygeum spartum and Limonium spp.) was less saline ({EC} 1:5 in the upper layers {\textasciitilde}0.4 to {\textasciitilde}4dSm−1) and drier (water level{\textgreater}−1.5m depth) than the abandoned saline ponds ({EC} 1:5 in the upper layers {\textasciitilde}2 to {\textasciitilde}9dSm−1 and water level between −1m depth and +0.2m above the soil surface), mainly colonised by Sarcocornia fruticosa, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Salicornia patula, Phragmites australis and Ruppia maritima in the flooded ponds. The soils of the periphery were always oxic (Eh{\textgreater}+500mV), but most of the abandoned saline ponds had suboxic ({\textasciitilde}+100mV{\textless}Eh{\textless}{\textasciitilde}+350mV) and even anoxic conditions (Eh{\textless}{\textasciitilde}+100mV), as shown by the existence of gley colours and redoximorphic features. The soil bulk density of the surface and subsurface layers showed that the most impermeable ponds were located in the centre of the marsh, where it is possible to maintain a surface water sheet during prolonged periods, suitable for the development of submerged plant species such as R. maritima and for waterbirds. Part of the seawater poured into more permeable ponds, such as those located in the southern and northern zones of the marsh, is lost by infiltration due to the lower bulk density of these soils. The latter facilitates the recovery of the piezometric levels and the growth of terrestrial plant species. Monitoring of redoximorphic features in the upper soil layers, in combination with symptoms of damage in the plants, could be used as a visual indicator of oxygen limitation due to excessive soil moisture. This would permit the regulation of the irrigation programme, hence optimising the energy and economic resources applied to maintain the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Bull Island ({BI}) is a coastal sand spit that formed as an unintended consequence of the construction of two walls, built over 200 years ago in Dublin Port, Ireland to alleviate silting of the shipping route. A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon ({SL}) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon ({NL}) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats ({MF}) and vegetated saltmarshes ({SM}). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across {BI}’s sediments, including total organic carbon ({TOC}), total nitrogen ({TN}), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon’s ({PAH}’s) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon.

	abstract = {Climate change has created a need for solutions that can counteract greenhouse gas emissions. One is the expansion and maintenance of natural carbon (C)-sequestration habitats, such as forests and coastal and marine vegetated ecosystems, socalled “blue carbon ecosystems” including salt marshes, which represent large and long-term C-storage potential. While salt marsh blue carbon is gaining international attention, Baltic and Nordic salt marshes have been neglected in the blue carbon context. Here, we quantified C-stocks and C-sequestration rates in grazed and nongrazed sites of three Danish salt marshes, and evaluated whether grazing livestock, the standard management to increase biodiversity of the marshes, affect C-stocks and sequestration rates. The aboveground biomass and vegetation height in nongrazed salt marshes were significantly larger than for grazed salt marshes, but this did not lead to significantly enhanced overall sediment- or C-accumulation rates. Detailed model analyses of sediment profiles even indicated significantly higher C-densities in surface layers at grazed sites. Averaged C-densities, C-stocks (top 43 cm sediment) and sequestration rates estimated from 210Pb profiles ranged 0.011–0.022 g C cm−3, 4228–8178 g C m−2, and 17–45 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively, with the latter being low in the global context. While this pioneering study for the Baltic and Nordic regions showed a neutral to positive effect of grazing on C-sequestration, there is a need to explore the overall C-footprint of this practice, including effects on net greenhouse gas emissions and coastal defense capacity, and define blue carbon management strategies for salt marshes to maximize their climate change mitigation and adaptation capacity while supporting biodiversity.},

	shorttitle = {Data for},
	abstract = {Our study of a St. Lawrence Estuary marsh reveals that, compared to the native Spartina patens-dominated vegetation, invasive Phragmites australis makes a greater contribution to soil volume and carbon stock (referred to as blue carbon). Phragmites contributions to soil volume enhances marsh sustainability in the face of sea level rise and its greater contribution to soil carbon helps to reduce the atmospheric concentration of {CO}2. An invasive genetic strain, introduced from Europe or Asia, has expanded extensively along the St. Lawrence River in the last few decades, but has been little studied on the estuarine portion of the St. Lawrence River. We collected soil cores from Phragmites stand and S. patens-dominated stand in a St. Lawrence Estuary salt marsh near la Pocatiere, Quebec. We measured the bulk density, carbon content, volume and mass of belowground organic matter in 2-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at each Phragmites site. Only bulk density and carbon content were measured in 5-cm thick soil layers of 3 cores at S. patens site. Results showed that soil in the Phragmites stands held 37-77\% more blue carbon than in the S. patens-dominated marsh. Based upon their diameter size, Phragmites rhizomes could be contributing 7.4-10.2 cm to the thickness in the upper 20 cm of soil. We suggest that any management of invasive Phragmites include consideration of its role in increasing blue carbon stocks and marsh resilience along with other ecosystem services. This dataset includes soil carbon and belowground biomass composition data in a St. Lawrence estuary marsh invaded by Phragmites australis. Data were collected in 3 Phragmites sites in 2019 and 1 Spartina patens site in 2014. There are no data in belowgroud biomass composition in S. patens site. Data were collected to estimate the invasive Phragmites contribution to blue carbon stock and soil volume. This dataset contains one Excel file with two sheets ("main data" and "diameter"). These data are from field samples and lab analysis. Dry bulk density is calculated by dividing the dry weight by the initial volume. The organic matter content of the ground samples was measured through loss-on-ignition ({LOI}) with the equation developed by Craft et al. (1991): \% organic carbon = 0.40×\%{LOI} + 0.0025(\%{LOI})2. As much as possible, rhizomes and roots were identified to species using the key of Niering et al. (1977). We used the color and turgor of rhizomes and roots to discern live from dead. Live material is usually light in color and turgid. Dead tissue is dark and flaccid. Unidentified material (mostly roots) was grouped together as “other”. The volume of each species was determined by placing the entire sample of a species in a graduated cylinder with a known amount of water and measuring the volume of water displaced. The sorted groups of belowground biomass were oven dried at 60°C to constant weight.},

	abstract = {Sea-level rise is a significant threat to salt marshes. However, these habitats can respond by increasing their relative elevation, or by migrating into adjacent areas. Here we provide the first report on surface elevation change for salt marsh at the Knysna Estuary, South Africa, and predict the responses of these habitats to sea-level rise using the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model ({SLAMM}). Recent (2018) surface elevation measurements at lower intertidal salt marsh sites were compared with those from 2009–2011. The long-term (1960–2017) relative sea-level rise ({RSLR}) was estimated as 2.19 mm y−1 and only two of the seven sites assessed are keeping pace with this {RSLR}. The {SLAMM}, which was applied to a focus area near Thesen’s Island, predicted up to 40\% loss of upper intertidal salt marsh by 2100, because development in the adjacent area prevents habitat migration. Currently, salt marsh habitats cover a total of 667 ha, and artificial structures are present along 20.7 km of the perimeter. Protecting areas for salt marsh migration should be a conservation priority, because this estuary supports the third largest area of intertidal salt marsh in the country. Monitoring the responses of coastal wetlands should be prioritised so that natural capital contributes towards future resilience.},

	abstract = {Halophytes in estuaries are effective sinks of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Blue carbon ({BC}) is carbon stored in coastal habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass. The objectives of this study were to firstly assess the biomass and sediment C stocks in salt marsh (Spartina maritima and Salicornia tegetaria) and seagrass (Zostera capensis) habitats of the Swartkops Estuary, South Africa. Secondly, we applied the nutrient pollutant indicator ({NPI}) to assess the nutrient status of the estuary. Six replicate sediment cores of 1 m (summer) and 0.5 m (winter) per plant species were collected at six sites. Six replicates for biomass of each species were harvested at each site during summer and winter. Biomass and nutrient dynamics showed that there were distinct seasonal differences in the magnitude of C, N, and P stored in the plants. The sediment was the dominant C pool and differed spatially with creek sites storing more C. Out of the three species, S. maritima stored the most C (224 ± 19.1 Mg C ha−1 in sediment, 16.7 ± 1.2 Mg C ha−1 in biomass), followed by S. tegetaria (207 ± 3.5 Mg C ha−1 in sediment, 4.3 ± 0.4 Mg C ha−1 in biomass) and Z. capensis (180 ± 18.4 Mg C ha−1 in sediment, 2.1 ± 0.7 Mg C ha−1 in biomass). The N:biomass ratios were low in both seasons for Z. capensis, S. maritima and S. tegetaria (0.08, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively) indicating consistent eutrophic conditions in the estuary. Resultantly, the plants displayed a significantly lower below-ground standing biomass highlighting the potential variations of {BC} storage in eutrophic estuaries.},

	abstract = {Estuaries are dynamic interfaces between land, rivers and the ocean that play major roles in the global carbon cycle. These coastal wetlands store huge amounts of organic carbon ({OC}), commonly known as “blue carbon” and excellent places to study C cycling. The Guadiana river estuary is among the most important tidal salt marshes in the South - Iberian coastal margin. Here, a detailed organic geochemical study is described that includes the identification of sedimentary {OM} composition at a molecular and isotopic level. Total organic carbon content ({TOC}) of core sediments ranged from 0.39 to 2.23\% and stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) also showed a wide range between −22.4 and −27.0‰. A13C depletion trend observed from the surface to bottom in the core sediments profiles, reflects loss of labile biogenic 13C enriched compounds i.e. polysaccharides and a selective preservation of more depleted compounds with depth i.e. lignin and lipids in the core sediments. Series of n-alkanes were found in the range from C10 to C31. Carbon preference index ratio ({CPI}) calculated for long-chain n-alkanes (C24–C31) that ranged between 1.17 and 1.94 reflecting diverse {OM} inputs to the sediments. A study of the lignin-derived phenolic composition pointed to a recalcitrant {OM} derived from both gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. Moreover, high abundance of vinyl phenol and vinyl guaiacol points to a dominant contribution of lignins from grasses and aquatic macrophytes to the sediments. A well-resolved series of long-chain linear alkyl benzenes ({LABs} from C4 to C22) were recorded in all core sediment samples indicating direct discharge of untreated domestic and/or industrial effluents to the estuary. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAHs}) with more than 3 rings reflects the pyrogenic origin of a portion of the sedimentary {OM}. This study highlights the importance of different {OM} sources to the lower Guadiana estuarine sediments and contributes to a better knowledge about its origin, dynamics and fate.},

Coastal {CO}2 and {CH}4 flux rates play an important role in regulating atmospheric {CO}2 and {CH}4 concentrations. However, the relative contributions of vegetation, soil properties, and spatial structure on dry-season ecosystem carbon (C) rates (net ecosystem {CO}2 exchange, {NEE}; ecosystem respiration, {ER}; gross ecosystem productivity, {GEP}; and {CH}4) remain unclear at a regional scale. Here, we compared dry-season ecosystem C rates, plant, and soil properties across three vegetation types from 13 locations at a regional scale in the Yellow River Delta ({YRD}). The results showed that the Phragmites australis stand had the greatest {NEE} (-1365.4 μmol m-2 s-1), {ER} (660.2 μmol m-2 s-1), {GEP} (-2025.5 μmol m-2 s-1) and acted as a {CH}4 source (0.27 μmol m-2 s-1), whereas the Suaeda heteroptera and Tamarix chinensis stands uptook {CH}4 (-0.02 to -0.12 μmol m-2 s-1). Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that plant biomass was the main factor explaining all of the investigated carbon rates ({GEP}, {ER}, {NEE}, and {CH}4); while soil organic carbon was shown to be the most important for explaining the variability in the processes of carbon release to the atmosphere, i.e., {ER} and {CH}4. Variation partitioning results showed that vegetation and soil properties played equally important roles in shaping the pattern of C rates in the {YRD}. These results provide a better understanding of the link between ecosystem C rates and environmental drivers, and provide a framework to predict regional-scale ecosystem C fluxes under future climate change.},

	abstract = {Blue carbon ({BC}) ecosystems provide important and multiple ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation through carbon storage. However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (Corg) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of Corg stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove, seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using 210Pb-dated sediment cores. Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (Corg stock(100 years)) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg Corg ha−1 in mangroves, 8–53 Mg Corg ha−1 in seagrasses and 32–56 Mg Corg ha−1 in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8–426 g m−2 yr−1, 2–252 g m−2 yr−1 and 1–60 g m−2 yr−1, respectively. Most of the stored Corg (60–86\%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent Corg stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900–1950), most likely as a result of land use changes. Increased Corg burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in Corg content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal. Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected Corg stocks and burial rates in {BC} ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried Corg through significant {CO}2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation.},

	abstract = {Coastal vegetated ecosystems constitute very productive habitats, characterized by efficient Corg sequestration and long-term preservation in sediments, so they play an important role in climate change mitigation. The temporal evolution of Corg content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using 210Pb-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates ({MAR}: 0.01–0.03 g cm−2 yr−1) than seagrass cores ({MAR}: 0.02–3.21 g cm−2 yr−1). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The Corg stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2–53.6 Mg ha−1 at 10 cm depth; 259–320 Mg ha−1 at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7–14.4 Mg ha−1, and 80–98, Mg ha−1, respectively), whereas Corg burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13–60 g m−2 yr−1) than in seagrass (9–144 g m−2 yr−1) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in Corg burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall Corg stock (485 ± 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby. Our results highlight the need to protect these environments as relevant carbon reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Question To what extent is restoration of vegetation in coastal grasslands delayed by accumulation of nutrients after abandonment of traditional management and subsequent reed encroachment? How does nutrient flow in the plant–soil system react to reintroduction of grazing? Location Coast of Baltic Sea, western Estonia. Methods Abandoned, continuously managed and restored coastal meadows were selected in four different study regions and their vegetation composition sampled. Nitrogen, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg concentrations and C/N ratios were determined in both vegetation and soil. Differences between management groups were evaluated. Results Comparison among different management groups revealed several differences in both relative and total amount of nutrients in soil and vegetation. Most soil properties of restored sites were similar to those in abandoned sites. Carbon stock in the soil profile doubled after abandonment, total N concentration in the top soil layer increased while plant available P concentration decreased. The phytomass and chemical composition of phytomass rapidly changed back to a ‘normal’ level after restoration. Species composition remained different, but species typical of coastal grasslands were present in restored sites. There was a strong site specificity in the results. Conclusions Re-establishment of grazing had a rapid impact on plant biomass of coastal grasslands. Species composition responded more slowly, but target species returned relatively quickly. Slow recovery of soil properties, however, means that the results of restoration may be fragile and return of tall-growth vegetation is very probable if managent intensity declines. Long restoration periods should be planned to reach pre-abandonment environmental conditions when using non-destructive restoration methods.},

	abstract = {Tidal marshes rank among the ecosystems with the highest capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (Corg) on earth. To inform conservation of coastal vegetated ecosystems for climate change mitigation, this study investigated the factors driving variability in carbon storage. We estimated soil Corg stocks in tidal marshes across temperate Western Australia and assessed differences among geomorphic settings (marine and fluvial deltas, and mid-estuary) and vegetation type (Sarcocornia quinqueflora and Juncus kraussii) linked to soil biogeochemistry. Soil Corg stocks within fluvial and mid-estuary settings were significantly higher (209 ± 14 and 211 ± 20 Mg Corg ha−1, respectively; 1-m-thick soils) than in marine counterparts (156 ± 12 Mg Corg ha−1), which can be partially explained by higher preservation of soil Corg in fluvial and mid-estuary settings rich in fine-grained ({\textless} 0.063 mm) sediments (49 ± 3\% and 47 ± 4\%, respectively) compared to marine settings (23 ± 4\%). Soil Corg stocks were not significantly different between S. quinqueflora and J. kraussii marshes (185 ± 13 and 202 ± 13 Mg Corg ha−1, respectively). The higher contribution of tidal marsh plus supratidal vegetation in fluvial (80\%) and intermediate (76\%) compared to marine (57\%) settings further explains differences in soil Corg stocks. The estimated soil Corg stocks in temperate Western Australia’s tidal marshes (57 Tg Corg within {\textasciitilde} 3000 km2 extent) correspond to about 2\% of worldwide tidal marsh soil Corg stocks. The results obtained identify global drivers of soil Corg storage in tidal marshes and can be used to target hot spots for climate change mitigation based on tidal marsh conservation.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen were measured by gas chromatography method, and the carbon content of inorganic compounds was determined by the volumetric method in soils of undisturbed coastal landscapes of the Barents Sea (Khaypudyrskaya Bay). Two groups of soils were specified. The first group included saline marsh soils formed under flooding by tidewater and surging seawater. The second group included soils of tundra ecosystems, which were subjected to precipitation of marine aerosols. In the first group, the content of Corg varied from 5 to 75 g/kg, the content of N total varied from 1 to 5 g/kg, and the Corg/Ntot ratio varied from 10 to 18. Humus-accumulative horizons buried under recent marine sediments were described in the middle part of the marsh soil profile. In the second group, the contents of Corg was 430–470 g/kg and Ntot 4–7 g/kg. The Corg/Ntot ratio in the surface peat horizons equaled to 64–95 g/kg and decreased by three–seven times in the deeper layers. The soils of the low-level marshes flooded each tide and especially their surface horizons contained more inorganic carbon than any other soils. Mass fraction of inorganic carbon varied from 4 to 20\% of the total carbon content. Seawater and carbonate-containing rocks could be the source of the inorganic carbon. A correlation was found between the contents of Corg and Ntot in soils and in plant communities growing on these soils. Additional input of Corg and Ntot into marsh soils was due to the living activity of birds and to organic substances in seawater.},

	abstract = {Among terrestrial ecosystems, coastal sandy dunes are particularly prone to alien plant invasion. Many studies related the invasion of dune habitats to anthropic causes, but less is known about the role of soil properties and plant traits in plant invasion. In this study, we tested the relationships between soil features and alien plant invasion in dune systems, focusing on the interplay between soil nutrients, soil salinity and plant functional traits.Study sites were sandy barrier islands of the Marano and Grado lagoon (northern Adriatic Sea). One hundred plots (4 m × 4 m) were selected within 10 areas according to the main habitats occurring along the ecological gradient of dune system (foredune, backdune and saltmarsh). In each plot, we recorded all plant species occurrence and abundance and we collected a soil core. For each soil sample, soil texture, conductivity (as proxy of soil salinity), organic carbon and nitrogen content were analyzed and related to the species number and cover of native and alien plants. Variation of main reproductive and vegetative functional traits among habitats was also analyzed for both alien and native species.Soil properties were strongly related to overall plant diversity, by differently affecting alien and native species pools. In backdune, the most invaded habitat, a high soil conductivity limited the number of alien species, whereas the content of soil organic carbon increased along with alien plant abundance, suggesting also the occurrence of potential feedback processes between plant invasion and soil. We found a significant convergence between native and alien plant functional trait spectra only in backdune habitat, where environmental conditions ameliorate and plant competition increases. Our findings suggest that in harsh conditions only native specialized plants can thrive while at intermediate conditions, soil properties gradient acts in synergy with plant traits to curb/facilitate alien plant richness.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands. In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (210Pb and 137Cs) to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil carbon stocks were estimated from cores. Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m2 y−1, and these were correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha−1, which is very low compared with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg C ha−1 for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha−1 for mangroves, and 140 Mg C ha−1 for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise, which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to continue or be reversed.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon ({SOC}) in coastal wetlands, also known as “blue C,” is an essential component of the global C cycles. To gain a detailed insight into blue C storage and controlling factors, we studied 142 sites across ca. 5000 km of coastal wetlands, covering temperate, subtropical, and tropical climates in China. The wetlands represented six vegetation types (Phragmites australis, mixed of P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda, Spartina alterniflora, mangrove [Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina], tidal flat) and three vegetation types invaded by S. alterniflora (P. australis, K. obovata, A. marina). Our results revealed large spatial heterogeneity in {SOC} density of the top 1-m ranging 40–200 Mg C ha−1, with higher values in mid-latitude regions (25–30° N) compared with those in both low- (20°N) and high-latitude (38–40°N) regions. Vegetation type influenced {SOC} density, with P. australis and S. alterniflora having the largest {SOC} density, followed by mangrove, mixed P. australis and Suaeda, single Suaeda and tidal flat. {SOC} density increased by 6.25 Mg ha−1 following S. alterniflora invasion into P. australis community but decreased by 28.56 and 8.17 Mg ha−1 following invasion into K. obovata and A. marina communities. Based on field measurements and published literature, we calculated a total inventory of 57 × 106 Mg C in the top 1-m soil across China's coastal wetlands. Edaphic variables controlled {SOC} content, with soil chemical properties explaining the largest variance in {SOC} content. Climate did not control {SOC} content but had a strong interactive effect with edaphic variables. Plant biomass and quality traits were a minor contributor in regulating {SOC} content, highlighting the importance of quantity and quality of {OC} inputs and the balance between production and degradation within the coastal wetlands. These findings provide new insights into blue C stabilization mechanisms and sequestration capacity in coastal wetlands.},

	abstract = {Changing winter climate extremes are expected to result in the poleward migration of mangrove forests at the expense of salt marshes. Although mangroves and marshes are both highly valued ecosystems, the ecological implications of mangrove expansion have not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effects of mangrove expansion on below-ground properties related to peat development and carbon storage. We investigated plant–soil interactions in marshes and across mangrove forest structural gradients in three locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico ({USA}). We compared our results to those from terrestrial grasslands where the effects of woody plant encroachment are often influenced by rainfall and plant traits. Abiotic conditions at our study locations differed, particularly in terms of physicochemical properties related to precipitation. Marsh species composition, marsh above-ground biomass, and mangrove forest structural complexity also varied across these locations. Marshes in the driest location (Central Texas) had higher salinities and were dominated by low biomass succulent plants and lower soil carbon pools. Marshes in the wetter, less saline locations (Louisiana and North Florida) contained high biomass grasses and higher soil carbon pools. At all locations, above-ground biomass and above-ground carbon pools were higher in mangroves than marshes; however, below-ground soil carbon pools were only higher in mangroves than marshes in the driest location. In the wetter locations, the linkages between mangrove forest structure and soil properties were minimal or not significant. However, in the driest location, there was a significant increase in soil properties related to peat development and carbon storage with increased mangrove forest structural development. Synthesis: Our results indicate that the ecological implications of woody plant encroachment in tidal saline wetlands are dependent upon precipitation controls of plant–soil interactions. Although the above-ground effects of mangrove expansion are consistently large, below-ground influences of mangrove expansion appear to be greatest along low-rainfall coasts where salinities are high and marshes being replaced are carbon poor and dominated by succulent plants. Collectively, these findings complement those from terrestrial ecosystems and reinforce the importance of considering rainfall and plant–soil interactions within predictions of the ecological effects of woody plant encroachment.},

	abstract = {Wetland ecosystems, particularly coastal vegetated ecosystems, play a vital role in climate mitigation and adaptation. Coastal vegetated habitats (including coastal wetlands such as seagrass meadows, saltmarshes, and mangroves) are some of the most efficient ecosystems for storing carbon on a per hectare basis, retaining organic carbon for centuries to millennia. We conducted carbon stock assessments, to a depth of 1 m, across four young saltmarsh sites and the adjacent mudflats in Dublin, Ireland. Soil cores and vegetation samples were taken across each site in order to analyze the carbon content of each carbon pool. The carbon density of Dublin’s saltmarshes was 112.1 ± 10.1 Mg Corg ha−1. The dominant plant species were Spartina anglica, Plantago maritima, and Atriplex portulacoides. The soil carbon pool of these saltmarshes contributes 87\% to the total carbon stock, with living plant biomass contributing the remaining 13\%. Saltmarshes are important ecosystems for climate mitigation and can provide nature-based solutions to reduce net carbon emissions; however, their degradation will lead to the loss of climate-relevant carbon pools.},

	abstract = {The island Spiekeroog (Germany) at the southern North Sea coast exhibits an island tail (Ostplate) of which large parts formed after 1860 by gradual eastward deposition of marine sediments. This study aimed to (i) provide a first overview of soils on the Ostplate, (ii) verify whether soil formation stages in different landscape elements (dune chain, dune slacks, saltmarsh, pioneer zone) are linked to the island’s gradual development and (iii) to assess the impact of tides and winds on soil formation. Standard physicochemical properties of dune -and dune slack topsoils and 19 pedons (i.a. {pH}, total organic carbon ({TOC}), total inorganic carbon ({TIC}), total nitrogen ({TN}), and mean weight diameter ({MWD}) of water stable aggregates) were analyzed. Soils of the dune slacks, the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone classified as Gleysols which showed no trend towards differences along the Ostplate. The dune chain exhibited Protic Arenosols that were initially acidified in lee positions (min. {pH} = 5.1). Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) signatures of saltmarsh sediments were used as a proxy for the tidal influence on soil formation. In addition, sulfur (S) isotope (δ34S) signatures revealed insights on sulfur sources in the saltmarsh. The δ13C signatures of organic matter ({OM}) decreased and {TOC}/{TN} -and {TOC}/total sulfur ({TS}) ratios increased with increasing elevation and decreasing flooding frequency. At higher flooding frequency, δ15N resembled the dominant input of {OM} from the southern North Sea, at a lower interaction level, mixing of a wider range of sources was indicated. S isotopes indicated dissolved sulfate and reduced species as sulfur sources. It was concluded that an ongoing impact of wind-induced sand movement at the dunes, and flooding-induced sediment movement in the saltmarsh and the pioneer zone, repealed any potential disparities in soil formation stages, which might have existed along the Ostplate.},

To better understand how these factors influenced modern organic carbon ({OC}) sources and accumulation rates, we measured {OC} as well as stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) in 210Pb-dated sediments within a vegetated saltmarsh habitat and a human impacted habitat. Relative Sea Level ({RSL}) at the nearby tide gauge station data and four different Sea Surface Temperature ({SST}) data sets were analyzed starting from 1900 to assess the potential effect of sea ingression and warming on the coastal lagoon sedimentary processes. The source contribution calculated from the {MixSIAR} Bayesian model revealed a mixed composition of sedimentary {OC}, dominated by an increase in marine-derived {OC} after the 1950s, matching with a decrease from autochthonous saltmarsh vegetation (Juncus spp.) in the saltmarsh habitat, and from riverine/estuarine-derived {OC} in the impacted habitat. {RSL} rise in the area (8.7 ± 0.5 mm yr−1 in the period 1900–2014) has been mainly driven by the land subsidence, especially during the central decades of the last century, enhancing the sea ingression into the lagoon. {RSL} rise influenced changes in sedimentary {OC} sources and accumulation at different level within the two habitats from the 1950s onward; conversely, no direct effect of {SST} was detected.},

	abstract = {The implementation of climate change mitigation strategies based on the conservation and restoration of Blue Carbon ecosystems requires a deep understanding of the magnitude and variability in organic carbon (Corg) storage across and within these ecosystems. This study explored the variability in soil Corg stocks and burial rates across and within intertidal estuarine habitats of the Atlantic European coast and its relation to biotic and abiotic drivers. A total of 136 soil cores were collected across saltmarshes located at different tidal zones (high marsh, N = 45; low marsh, N = 30), seagrass meadows (N = 17) and tidal flats (N = 44), and from the inner to the outer sections of five estuaries characterized by different basin land uses. Soil Corg stocks were higher in high-marsh communities (65 ± 3 Mg ha−1) than in low-marsh communities (38 ± 3 Mg ha−1), seagrass meadows (40 ± 5 Mg ha−1) and unvegetated tidal flats (46 ± 3 Mg ha−1) whereas Corg burial rates also tended to be higher in high marshes (62 ± 13 g m−2 y−1) compared to low marshes (43 ± 15 g m−2 y−1) and tidal flats (35 ± 9 g m−2 y−1). Soil Corg stocks and burial rates decreased from inner to outer estuarine sections in most estuaries reflecting the decrease in the river influence towards the estuary mouth. Higher soil Corg stocks were related to higher content of silt and clay and higher proportion of forest and natural land within the river basin, pointing at new opportunities for protecting coastal natural carbon sinks based on the conservation and restoration of upland ecosystems. Our study contributes to the global inventory of Blue Carbon by adding data from unexplored regions and habitats in Europe, and by identifying drivers of variability across and within estuaries.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands are key in regulating coastal carbon and nitrogen dynamics and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and anthropogenic nutrient reduction. We investigated organic carbon ({OC}) and total nitrogen ({TN}) stocks and burial rates at four adjacent vegetated coastal habitats across the seascape elevation gradient of Cádiz Bay (South Spain), including one species of salt marsh, two of seagrasses, and a macroalgae. {OC} and {TN} stocks in the upper 1 m sediment layer were higher at the subtidal seagrass Cymodocea nodosa (72.3 Mg {OC} ha−1, 8.6 Mg {TN} ha−1) followed by the upper intertidal salt marsh Sporobolus maritimus (66.5 Mg {OC} ha−1, 5.9 Mg {TN} ha−1), the subtidal rhizophytic macroalgae Caulerpa prolifera (62.2 Mg {OC} ha−1, 7.2 Mg {TN} ha−1), and the lower intertidal seagrass Zostera noltei (52.8 Mg {OC} ha−1, 5.2 Mg {TN} ha−1). The sedimentation rates increased from lower to higher elevation, from the intertidal salt marsh (0.24 g cm−2 y−1) to the subtidal macroalgae (0.12 g cm−2 y−1). The organic carbon burial rate was highest at the intertidal salt marsh (91 ± 31 g {OC} m−2 y−1), followed by the intertidal seagrass, (44 ± 15 g {OC} m−2 y−1), the subtidal seagrass (39 ± 6 g {OC} m−2 y−1), and the subtidal macroalgae (28 ± 4 g {OC} m−2 y−1). Total nitrogen burial rates were similar among the three lower vegetation types, ranging from 5 ± 2 to 3 ± 1 g {TN} m−2 y−1, and peaked at S. maritimus salt marsh with 7 ± 1 g {TN} m−2 y−1. The contribution of allochthonous sources to the sedimentary organic matter decreased with elevation, from 72\% in C. prolifera to 33\% at S. maritimus. Our results highlight the need of using habitat-specific {OC} and {TN} stocks and burial rates to improve our ability to predict {OC} and {TN} sequestration capacity of vegetated coastal habitats at the seascape level. We also demonstrated that the stocks and burial rates in C. prolifera habitats were within the range of well-accepted blue carbon ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and salt marshes.},

	abstract = {Blue carbon ecosystems sequester and store a larger mass of organic carbon per unit area than many other vegetated ecosystems, with most being stored in the soil. Understanding the fine-scale drivers of variability in blue carbon soil stocks is important for supporting accurate carbon accounting and effective management of saltmarsh and mangrove habitats for carbon abatement. Here, we investigate the influence of local- and regional-scale environmental factors on soil organic carbon stocks using a case study from South Australia. We sampled 74 soil cores from mangrove, intertidal saltmarsh and supratidal saltmarsh sites where we also recorded precise elevation and vegetation data. Using a Bayesian mixed-effects regression approach, we modelled soil organic carbon stocks as a function of multiple environmental variables. The best model (Bayes R2 = 0.82) found that distance to the nearest tidal creek, vegetation type and soil texture significantly affected soil organic carbon stocks. Coarser soils with higher sand content had lower stocks, while finer-grained, clay-dominated soils had greater stocks. Mangroves had significantly greater stocks than intertidal saltmarshes and stocks were higher in sites closer to tidal creeks, highlighting the important role that local tidal creek systems play in sediment and water transport. This study’s findings are based on a broader range of local environmental factors than are usually considered in blue carbon models and increase our understanding and ability to predict site-level soil organic blue carbon stocks. The results emphasise the potential for organic carbon stocks to vary at local scales; the ability to predict this using appropriate environmental datasets; and the importance of accounting for local organic carbon stock variability when selecting sites for blue carbon-focussed restoration or conservation actions that aim to achieve carbon abatement.},
